It really could have they make such incredible new Ingenuity equipment that you know, it's just really great to use. I love it that just designed me a set of my own sins. We started this line called The Bionic AF, you know what that means? So the probably got a bionic a offline with short travel easy carbon fiber sins that are super super light and I like them short because I can't maneuver as well anymore with my diving leg my robotic diving leg because it doesn't really Bend at the knee whenever I want it to like you would if you're spinning with your normal leg. And so having these really long freediving sins and bulky scuba Sims makes it harder. So that made these really short wide powerful carbon fiber. Thins that I just amazing and then travel bags you can put all your stuff in a really awesome day say that's perfect for traveling really light really easy to use for me with one hand.

They were works of art and now they hang in our home for my 30th birthday my 30th. It was my 30th birthday.

Hmm and you yeah, so it's like I'm not knocking it. Send it to you because I need you to be like that's a good one. That's a bad one. Your ass looks amazing. Right we don't live together now.

Food part way through the game part of me does want to try out the new Firestorm for Battlefield because I do kind of want to see like, how are they going to how are they going to handle Vehicles? Because even though like the high-tier like armored vehicles, you have to go to like a specific spot on the map and then you have to work together. And if you work together from the way it sounds is that if you work together, you get the doors open faster and therefore you can get inside. But I would like to definitely see how they do it because if they can figure it out and then you know, obviously it's ETA. So like if they can figure it out and then maybe Titanfall kind of, you know looks over their shoulder and be like, okay, maybe tighten its can work together and try to make like add it to Em are br-2. I mean cause baby you could be like a bunker type situation where you have to go to very specific part of the map. I think they have to work together, you know anything	1.0

Um, so yeah finding a professional that works will be that's not homophobic. That isn't crazy. ABS is not easy all the time. Genuinely and where that hasn't been through anything. So we're like well, maybe you should meditate. Yeah, you're just not going to buy with some of them. Yeah, like, you know, like when you're going to school if I go to like college, I went to UMass for three years and there were so many girls that were getting psyched agrees. That just made me laugh because I was like, you literally have no empathy but you don't understand through any psyche at all because you learn you can read about it in a book. Yeah you can read about Like anxiety, but if you don't have anxiety, you just don't know what it's like. Yeah, and these are the same girls that II that something goes wrong with their friends they call up their fucking mental health with their school and send them away. You know, like they do not there they do not know or care even to take the time to understand the emotion that you're feeling. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of it is just like making an effort to understand what your friends are going through and like my thing is Don't treat people the way you want to be treated treat them the way they want to be treated sometimes like yes and have you don't understand? Yeah, like yeah. We're not the same time just to say yeah, how can I support you? Hmm? Yeah, like I've been having a rough month my good friend just said what can I do to make sure that you're safe and to provide you support that's really weird. And if we're good sighs. Do you want to give you want to give your friend support? Yep, without being their therapist. You can still ask for support like that's where humans me. That you know, yep, and I literally told her send me a meme or two. I'll hit you up when I need you. Yeah, sometimes it's as simple as a setting for someone that's sad like so and just being like I'm here, you know living in talk. We cannot talk we can watch TV at like my presence shows that I care. Definitely. I don't have the words for it. Yeah, you know. So I guess that's how to help a depressed friend is just to be there for them. Yeah and like and not give up on them. Even if they don't come to all your social Gatherings key inviting them. Yeah, because they want to know the people still love them. Yeah, and that just reinforces like, oh no one loves me like, you know, just like invite them places, like even if they don't go like kind of have the expectation that like if you're like plans are going to like if you make plans with them like they might fall through and like that's okay like be kind to them. Yeah. Be understanding and if they're really pissed about something like I do is with my family too and like they probably need a little extra love. Yeah. Yeah and just let them be angry, you know exiled them a little extra love when they're feeling really intense emotions because even though that's when you want to love them the least until they needed the most definitely, you know, yeah like the other day. My mom was in a really really bad mood yelling at me for no reason and I instead of being like upset. I was just like I just walked up to her and gave her a hug and just it was just like how how like and she started crying and I wasn't so she was sad. Yeah, you know and I was just like so like I immediately was like, okay. She probably needs a little extra love definitely. These kids came into my work the other day and they said some sick shit. They were like, oh when I was a kid, I used to feed alka-seltzers to seagulls. So they would blow up what the heck and I literally like my heart actually started in my chest. I feel so sick and I just said dude. Can you come across the counter? I'm going to give you a hug because apparently your parents never Hugged you you don't just do that if you got hugs, so I came around the counter and I gave him a big hug. We said I'm a pretty messed-up guy that said you should go to therapy. You said, you know what? I'm considering it and then we talked about therapy. That's another thing and that see that is not the response. He was looking for he was looking for me to be like had a heavy that Titans of the bird. Hey Emma. No I said I said yo your parents didn't hug you. Yeah, that's it. That's an animal. You know what I mean? Like could have been like what kind of sick fuck are you would yeah, sick fuck regardless. Don't get me wrong. But do I want him to go on to be a serial killer? No show him. Why don't ya	1.0

So like blindly following it without opening their mind to any sort of like, I don't know the only very specific scriptures, by the way, because yeah, they much like me or the pastor's I've had would quote like something really beautiful and then you read two lines down and it's like by the way, like slavery is should be honored and you're like wait what people that's what's so funny because I recently did a video about gay marriage as well and I was responsible.	0.0

Eh has always a good age. And so I was living in Beverly at the time and I was like sort of talking to this guy and like this is a common theme every girl in their life has a crush on a drug dealer.

That's A cool but like ones that's why would you pay for National Geographic? It's a weird thing to pay for. I feel like I guess I don't know my dad would stand around and watch National Geographic on TV all day or whatever but like and like once I everyone seen every fucking Pixar movie and then you're going to watch the new one theater is and then like well, maybe that's you I think people have kids and stuff to you know, I think most people you have Disney plus.	1.0
That's totally that's that's a good I think that's fair because I felt the same thing like there are certain things that stuck out to me, especially in the first episode like remember that blue guy. Why none of that blue guy in the first episode he was so out of place in my eyes. Like he he totally like totally didn't fit the show because like the Mandalorian at it's very core. It seems to me like it's like a space Western, you know, and it's like everyone's grittier and it is cheesy in some parts like the I have spoken guy, but it's still totally relevant. But the blue guy to me in the first episode stuck out like a sore thumb like he he broke the tone for me. That's when I was like, oh this might Bad show so I share the sentiment but I think okay overarching lie like the show is darker grittier, but it still has that like that Star Wars cheese in it though. It's like the character like the hard thing is now to make the Mandalorian an empathetic character because he's not taking off his helmet. I think that's going to be really interesting.	1.0
It is genuinely some folks of talk. Some folks here boys. Akemi Hennessey. Akemi ago Douglas life back Sam rickets. Oh good you guys right back as a captain as well. Send to back sends. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. See, I definitely like to have another crack later in the season if possible. Yeah, that's my goal is to see it for the tracks easy. Yeah, maybe you know freak A 4 comes up.	1.0
I don't even like the video it was dumb. It was video called why I left Christianity and it was actually a response video to a different video that I had made where I had said like, you know, I was silenced in church and like I wasn't allowed Odd to ask questions and like all this stuff and people were like, you know commenting on that and so I did a response video basically clarifying saying I was allowed to ask questions, but I could only ask them once and then once I asked them and got the Christian answer it was like that's your answer like accept it and if it wasn't good enough for me. It was like why are you like beating a dead horse? Why are you still so like, you know, you're just trying to like, you know, put your Deceitful Wicked heart into scripture because you want you know it to be the way you want it to be in like all this stuff and it was just such a misinterpretation of me. Just trying to like learn more and do research and it was like if you keep talking like that you're going to talk yourself right out of this face like you don't sound like a Christian to me and it was just kind of a lot of kind of it wasn't even a very accurate title now that I'm thinking about it because I truly clarified and said I left because I didn't think If the facts were there but in the midst of me doing all this research and and kind of getting all these questions brought to the surface. I was a bit frustrated that I was like borderline not even a Christian at this point and yet you know people I knew who wanted to go into Ministry who were dedicating their life to this Faith didn't even care enough to know the deeper side of their belief system. Like they just had no interest in looking deeper and study. Harder in in answering my questions and like I understood that everyone has their own life and you know, they can't just put it on pause to then, you know study all this stuff with me, but it did frustrate me that the church in itself did a poor job of preparing Christians for the tough questions. Like if there's an atheist who knows apologetics better than Christians, that's that's not good. Good, you know I don't know I feel like that video was like misinterpreted through the YouTube space is crazy.	0.0
Yeah, it's best I could yes are they kind of just go switch in once it comes with straps yourself? Yep. Take it forward. It is like there's not much I can do about it now and I've liked it. He said coming off an injury last year where I ran through the injury and just made it so much worse. I mean he had to take months off. Mr. Rice, then miss a number five.	0.0
Yeah that never made sense to me because it honestly it was used as just like a silencing tactic and a way for like Christians to feel like they could be above other Christians. I feel like like they felt like their point was like being offended when they could pull that verse out and kind of like it's because they don't have a point but beyond that point.	0.0
I don't so I it makes sense to me the like of course. I don't find it as funny now but 2006 that's the first episode that makes sense.	1.0
Yeah, that'll definitely fix it for you. So, I mean we definitely Definitely stretch this out to a good-sized episode. Now. I feel like you know, there's we had a really good conversation. I definitely like to have you on again if you're able to yeah, and I'll definitely look into better gear not crackling too much. Oh, no, you sound absolutely fine.

Afterwards where we're getting those fights is we're rolling up on scene and people are hammering with naloxone prior to our arrival, but they're not doing in ventilating then we start ventilating then we give them a little bit more logs on and then they come up from the quickly right? It's probably because they've already got a pile of Narcan in them, but then there are hypoxic and then we're battling that so they're just confused.	0.0

It seems like he built a really great product and can totally see retailers using a I just want to understand is this a 10 million hundred million billion 10 billion dollar Marty six billion dollar market. So, how do you so let me tell you how I would think about Market size images you say you're going after the Middle Market right 10 million 250 million hundred ten million 100 million in Revenue. I think about Market size is how many retailers exist in that sort of bucket. How many of them don't have an A. Nap and what's your sort of annual price per retailer really backing through to the market? I just worry that we're going after a nice hundred million dollar market but not a ten billion dollar market, excellent. So the total addressable addressable Market our addressable Market is 6 as 36 billion dollars currently right now, but you and that's yeah, you can't think you can't think of it as total retail Stan you got to think about it as what Revenue can we get from our Target?

Like I yes, I know this feeling I've been this low before I can get out of it and then you know, I'll might eat a potato and now make me feel a bit better and it does it. I don't know. Yeah, it's weird but not as good and you know, like I say and some phenomenal This is one of the ladies I coach Jennifer at. Oh sir. She is 50 years old and she finished. I think I trained her little bit too. Well, I coached in a bit too. Well because she was only like 14 minutes behind me or something. And so thankfully, I mean not that it wouldn't be terrible if she'd beat me but you know, I'm competitive I don't you know, she she did really well and she was wrapped and up the first series. The name of the first woman and then was a lie someone I've never met her before. She probably had me on my half an hour but there's a lady named Sonia Jansen who I'd love to try and get on the podcast if she's listening and she she only had a baby six weeks ago.

Yeah, you get pumped by stop and you just say, oh that was just a log or something. It's Rick yourself inside. I've had my knee. A guy in the water first for the first 30 minutes he a swimming up and back up and back and it's equipment trying to detect him and I decided to do him a good turn and I said just jump out mate. Let me take over take a break and I jump in the water in a black wetsuit a pair of black fins, and I'm on the surface on my back. Just moving from point A to point B, and I look over my left shoulder to make sure that I'm still headed towards the bow of the warship that I'm supposed to be attacking and before I can turn back I You have a huge whack in my leg and it didn't really hurt but it just kind of shocked me and I turned around to look and there's just a massive shock head touching me and takes me feels like seconds to work out what's going on because I've never even seen a shock and all of a sudden is this, you know, it's like Shark Week has come to life in front of me while I'm swimming and I don't really know what to do. And I think the shark knows what to do either because it's kind of staring at me and we try to work. You out if I'm food, and then so my survival instincts kick in and I think all right. I've seen the crocodile hunter. I've seen Shark Week over our job it in the eyeball. So I tried but I can't move my arm and I looked down and I can see the teeth embedded into my wrist and every time I try and pull it I can see the flesh tearing I was so I think nothing left hand I go to the eyeball with my left and I reach over but I can't reach it and in short side grab it by the nose and try to push it off, but that Is the type of the lower jaw deeper into the back of my leg. So I cut back to try and punch it in the nose and by that stage the Sharks decided on food and starts to shake me and that's when the paint kicks in like a hundred teeth razor-sharp teeth on either side of your limb moving in unison to tear through your flash and all of the fight went out of them took me under water and I was just yelling and I was in agony and we popped up and I took it. Breath and then it took me back under and just kept thrashing me around like a rag doll and I realized how powerful it was nothing I could do and so I realized that I was going to die and I remember thinking to myself. I'm not going home today. I'm going to die right now and it was strange because it wasn't like times flow down. I think our bodies and our minds are such incredible machines and my mind went into hyperdrive and I started running. My life is hanging. Okay, am I ready to die and I thought well shit no coming from where I started out as a really lost and bad kids self-harming and drugs and all that stuff and fighting and stealing to where I had achieved Peace Keeping with the UN and the elite of the Navy and all that sort of stuff and I thought you know what I'll come further than I've ever thought possible if I'm going to die now I have no regrets. I'm ready to go. And so I let go and I was ready to drift away and the A shark at that point ripped through the rest of my leg and took my hand off and because it wasn't attached to me anymore. My wet suit made me boy and I'll pop to the surface and I realized that I wasn't dead and I thought shit. I got to get out of here before it comes back and I saw my safety boat with my three teammates in and I start to swim to the safety boat. But as soon as I take a stroke, I can see my hands gone. It just my arm ends at the end of my wetsuit and my medical training kicks in and I think I've got to keep that wound above my heart to stem the bleeding. So I've got one out of the water swim back to the boat with one hand and one leg because I can't even feel my right leg. I don't know what's wrong with it at this point. I just can't feel it. And the guys in the safety boat said I was literally swimming through a pool of my own blood and they said when they came in closer, he was actually so stick they could taste it in the air and I just I didn't think I was going to make it. I thought there's so much blood in the water sharks will come back and other sharks going to smell it and I'm going to die. I'm just waiting for a shock to grab me. By the other leg and it just never came so I just kept swimming back to the boat and eventually the guys got to me pulled me out of the water and just out of the sheer relief of not being eaten any more. I relax my eyes rolled back in my head and I pass out and my mate almost brings into action and his training tells him. I'm going into cardiac arrest and he needs to stimulate my heart. So he straddles me and he starts pummeling me in the chest. I'm trying to wake me back up and and it work. And I wake up and I look over and my hands gone freshly bitten off by a shark and I look up and tell me who's beating the shit out of me and I just think today sucks.	0.0

Yeah. So yeah. So once I got out of the military I came to Utah my parents live in Utah and it just again not super internet e days and so and I guess I didn't feel very good. It was strange even having been in the military and having gone some of the places that I went, you know, Kuwait and strange places. I still had kind of a problem feeling like I could just go like to LA. And live by myself and go to college they're like, I didn't feel comfortable with that partially because I was married at the time and I know for me I would've been fine being broke sleeping in a gutter going to college in LA, but I was married and so I had somebody else I needed to take into consideration. And so I felt like I couldn't like drag her along to do the same sort of thing. And so the kind of the compromise I think was moving to Utah to Salt Lake where my parents lived and go into the University of Utah has actually had from all from everything. I'd heard a pretty decent little film program moving from Idaho, right? No, so I was in England. Oh God. Yeah. So yeah grew up in Idaho. But then when doing military like left, Idaho and never looked back and and so I was yeah, I was stationed in England for most of the time I was in the in the Air Force and so it's moving back from England back to Utah which I like I did take the short route from Idaho to Utah for sure anyway, but yeah, it kind of took the long way around and so yeah, like I decided I'm like I'm gonna go to film school and you know, like I think Film school is definitely a conversation that could be had another day. Is it worth it? You know, there's a lot there's been a lot of talk about that like, you know, sometimes people say the best film school is just you know doing it, you know, and like I actually don't disagree with that especially in today's world. Yeah, especially today's world is when there's so much online you can read about like there's basically just textbooks online you could you have access to like every movie ever made like you can do a bit of self film school and like equipment like honestly, you know phones, you know, you can grab a phone. It's got a camera on it you can Start you can start doing stuff much easier than you could back when I started in school. There's more content and filmmaking today than there has been ever ever actually seen as such a crowded like this is the stuff I want to do stuff as a kid and like part of me wishes. I was born about 20 years later so I could really taken advantage of all this like at a younger age sure.	1.0

And I think we're going to end this podcast with a quote. I like to add. I'm going to leave a quote for this time and then we can have like Rick your debut one for next time. So today's quote that I would love to leave you all with would be so the quote that I live by and I it's really believable. So we'll give an example after I say the quote. Once you stop wanting something it usually happens. So like we were at Taco Bell and KFC today and Dave and Rick. He's been looking for jobs, right but they didn't go up and ask.

Well, it's out here. It's more of a celebration. It's like all days he'll you know, And then and everybody's just hanging around all day and used to call those we used to call those cotton carnivals. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's got me kind of I don't know. It's kind of like a celebration kind of I don't know if it has something to do like talking about Salinas, you know, the the Fiesta Mexican heritage Salinas rodale, you know, and just how the heritage is of it's a celebration more than just a two-hour rodeo in a few know and and you know my life she you know, everybody knows Haley she When she when she moved out moved out here and we started in started, you know going to the Royals but with me and you know, she had been out here a lot before as well, but before that but Morgan involved in the production and stuff like that, it was a it was a kind of a culture shock even for her being someone that did in the rodeo business. So for a lot of years to her dad and stuff and And then you know, they were raised under that Jerome Robby Robinson kind of Steel was it was it go into a building? It's a two-hour show, you know kind of almost like a concert you just went in and blew it out and it's not but they didn't when coming out here on the West Coast. It's like they're the committee's and then the celebration is idea behind it. Is it tell us you can keep him there for four hours at the beers. Can you make more money? So that's kind of a different way of doing it.	1.0

So I finally took down the tree after New Year, but I first took all the ornaments off because I really just wanted to get the tree like out so I took the ornaments off I put him in a little pile. I took the tree down. I like swept and stuff and all of a sudden it was like boom. My Deegan was awake. My two-year-old like things got crazy. My husband came home. Home at the same time and I had to go take a meal to a friend because she had just had a baby that was in the hospital. All right, whatever. So I'm like, oh my gosh, babe. I have to go take this meal. And so while you're watching football, can you just like start putting away those ornaments boom? I was out right? I should have put away and I the first thing I thought to was like you should probably put that ornament away ever, but I was like nah, that's fine. Right dumb because my two-year-old and a four-year-old were up. Round I should have known I should have known and I was like the Lord told me you need to put that ornament away, right? But I didn't so I came home and Lord.	1.0
Yeah, and I'm not trying to toot our own horn, but it was just a it was a but beat but no I there was just it was a really cool Dynamic of okay. I'm going into this thing and it just happened really fast so fast. So all of that was great for I think I was on the video team there for over a little bit over a year.	1.0

Like even before I think Fitness was instilled in me ever since I was in karate at age nine. I was doing karate four to six times a week, you know one to two hours a day sometimes three, especially on the weekends and you know, I would compete and I think that competitive Wedge was instilled in me ever since I was a kid and you did pretty well. Yeah, if I mean I was very competitive with serious, you know, and I give thanks to my Sensations the John out there. He was like my second dad and you know, he was definitely one of the reasons why I'm such a great trainer today because he the way that I count the way that I talk the way that I push other people he did to me. So kind of he left his print in my life.	1.0
I think yeah, I think that's going to be the one thing that's going to be a little bit of a struggle in the type fall to a campaign. Like I was just like you I bought Titanfall 2 on sale like probably 20 bucks. It was yeah, it definitely wasn't on release and bought it for the campaign because my friends were telling me I had needed to play the game but I got caught up in the multiplayer. I think I was playing the multiplayer for a month before I actually decided okay. I'm going to To pick away at the campaign and the campaign honestly is a lot shorter than what you expect. Right? Yeah, you don't have to dedicate too long to it. But the moment I finished that campaign Titanfall instantly became one of my favorite games of all time. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't want to blow the ending and it will hear our kids though. I mean the story itself is probably the reason why a lot of people are a big Titanfall 2 fans, but the whole Apex Legends reference Reference I think that was that's like really really cool. And I know that the I hope that they respond cut it does the same thing they did with Titanfall 2 was they sometimes had a little bit of lore that they would add on to the game in general, but you had to find on the internet in terms of like like scripted cartoons or something, but I hope that they do that with Apex just to give a bit more background to all the characters and I don't know about the whole Jack Cooper Legend to like I would love that. Yeah, but I feel like his ability is might be a bit o p yeah.	1.0
I'm sad I think both of you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're gonna get our shit in order open up our animal shelter, then we'll have kids together probably. Yeah or just dogs and cats.	0.0
What was it the lives that last weekend when I text you as like I'm going to quit the internet again today. Yeah, I don't do this anymore. Like I just want to know if you're like what happened? I'm like nothing happened. Yeah good the internet today. Like I just sometimes you're just like you kind of hit like this internal Tipping Point where nothing's really like doing anything but you're like, okay. Well the it's all creeping up again. And like I said the same thing I have I text you when I have a feeling weird and you're like, okay. Well, let me Knock you off the cliff and I'm like, yeah, and I have another good friend that lives in Ohio and I'll text her and I'm just like I don't know what's going on today. And so of course, it's nice to have other people who have the same anxiety situations that you do and so it's nice because like I might have a weird trigger point of like different things, but you also have different different areas that sets you off or I have another fun the same situation, but it's now we've kind of figured out how we can work together to kind of get you back into To a better space for that day, which is nice because then it's like okay. Well one you just saved me 50 bucks. We're going to therapist. Yeah, so it's somebody that truly cares about you and wants the best for you. So so it's like, okay. Are you having a better day now? Can I bring you some coffee?	1.0
I think people have written West Ham off, but I have to make it really tough to watch especially against they were going to be full of confidence just have to waste time from last season turn up because out crap.	0.0
Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about in terms of undesired consequences. The thing that we have to realize about a show is that you have the showrunner you have the writers, but then you also have the director and you have the editors specifically the editors. Those are going to be the ones are like, oh this shot and then he's going to look at him. They don't like him, you know, and they do kind of work in tandem, but each one. Those people have their own motive and I think what we caught in was this person's like who's Derek? I'm gonna you know, they're not going to do on the show. I'm going to slip this in for the fans ha ha ha and then you have the people like, oh well slip in a little steric and kind of string along the fans and then you have someone's like no staring and so it's just this mishmash of all these different motives and it makes it entirely confusing because you also have to remember that by season for we're dealing with Shelly. They either made a huge mistake or someone was really exposing but there was a storyboard release of their ideas. It was like an outline for season 3 be specifically for 320 and on that board. It said Styles mom, but it did and it was like in small letter. So something that you could tell that they weren't really expecting people to pick up but specifically there was no mention of Malia no mention of Shelley nothing. And so it's like you give Holland talks about used to talk about getting the scripts the same day and I'm like you have a period of time that is specifically for writing. Yeah, what is happening that you're giving scripts the same day of shooting what's going on in here? What's this mishmash?	0.0

But yeah, I mean, I guess you know, no one's parents are really around anymore and they're seniors. Yeah, I guess, you know get the Love on sure.	1.0
I like that idea for the in-game. So it's like the last squad or something and I can't remember what episode it was, but we did bring up Titans in the fact that like what if it was I think it was actually it was our first reader mail and somebody somebody had brought up like It was something like evolve. We're like there was one person on each squad or there. You know, there is they tweak the numbers so that basically it was kind of like evolved in the sense that you had to hunt down this Titan and kill it and I think something like that or something, where's this super rare item? And then you'll be able to call it in but you have to go to like certain spots to call it in the you can't just like have it call in anywhere. Yeah, I mean because once again, I hate to compare it to Fortnight, but when Fortnight has like it's Thanos limited time run. I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just have this nice little limited time thing. You have the Titans. It makes people happy, but then I guess the other problem with that. Is that what if it makes it better exactly.	1.0
Well, I don't know what happened. It's finally so sorry.	0.0
So right now we're just going to advertise it on their stories and stuff and hope it'll be fun to see it. It'll probably a Twitter that we make in the future. But um, yeah. Thanks guys for stopping by. This is Thomas. I'm Ricky and I'm Dave and this is big facts podcast. Peace out guys.	1.0

So I know I didn't take off fast. I'm jumping here because my brain doesn't work here - come on me. I'm still covering. I think I may have got got some brain damage. No, so I didn't take off fast. The first k I felt very comfortable first sort of 500 meters or so. I felt very comfortable. But there was a big pack of guys blocking the track in front and then we came came we came to the first style and climbing arnall and then you're waiting you just standing there and then I thought there's going to be so much of this waiting. And so what I did I thought I'm just going to get myself some space and I like so I jumped when I climbed over a style. I just accelerated and I broke away and I I just I wanted to put a bit of space between me and the group because I just got sick of this is where local knowledge comes into its own. Yeah, and so I known as I pushed her and I felt great which was a good feeling, you know, like I didn't feel like I was running threshold or anything else till conversational. But yes, I was running about five minute case in that first couple of kilometers and and running you're running through paddocks already and through long grass and and the lead At that point I was in second place. So Andrew Hoff who's a phenomenal Runner who I interviewed on the podcast a while back. He was already after a kilometer. He was already a couple hundred meters in front. And so and then he disappeared and went on to break the course record broke broke Brandon Davies course record, and I think he got 9 hours and 43 minutes so which is phenomenal and he's and I would dare say that and Who's not even in the best shape of his life yet? And so he's just a good runner. But anyway, so I'm running and I probably about the first ten kilometers. There's no major. There's a fair Climate about kilometer 6 to 7, where you go up this long road, we your dirt road and you just it's a it's a just a grinding uphill climb and there was me and this other this young bloke will running together second third for all of that and just we'll just check. But we will just sort of holding a reasonable pace and then we came down through the forest into Inman Valley which is checkpoint 1 and about that would be it about kilometer 16 and I was very quick turnaround. I got I filled up my my my bladder filled up grab some food said Thank you to the volunteers and then we were off again and So from from checkpoint one to the next checkpoint to is your where it starts to get a little bit tough, you know, so you there's only five checkpoints in the whole race. And so you really got to be self-sufficient and I was feeling really good at this point. I was just like yeah loving it conditions are good legs feel good. Everything felt good. So I kept running a bit well, and then there's a fair grind as you going up another Hill and you work your way on these Road Hills until You come to the first technical section, which is not until about kilometer 24 23 24, maybe. Yeah 24 and your head into my ponga Conservation Park, which is go so you're going from running on these dirt roads. It's very runnable, even though there's some climbing to the some of the most technical terrain you can get and it's a this is the part that breaks people really early. This is actually where I had my first low point. So you're going to my ponga their traffic is it just yet was there for a second?	1.0
Yep. I sure would I gotta see what day that's on on the first time. If I can't I made check that out the daylight. So I was crazy last episode we did. I was just talking about them, you know saying how I wished a lot of this stuff was still on with no was on Spotify, but I know about the whole deal though, Tommy Boy stuff and you know, he got this whole boycott with Tommy Boy wish who they were signed with. You know, Tommy blade basically saying de la Sol's I'm a bunch of money. So maybe them going on tour right now is, you know direct result of them trying to get get get out of debt with Tommy Boy.	1.0

I think we should offensively we were we were too cautious am on you isn't it was just after we lost to Chelsea and we were playing five three two, and is really negative.	0.0
Great. And like the reason that number goes back or the reason, you know, your weight comes back. And in fact, there are studies that show that in only like less than five percent of people can sustain intentional weight loss after a period of dieting meaning that 95% of the time and after a period of one to three years post diet you're going to gain that weight back and the reason why is because your body wants to be at a state of homeostasis, which means that it's keeping things at you know, your your internal set point of what is a normal and healthy weight for you and that number is different for different people based off of your Or metabolism your genes your culture so many lifestyle factors. So it's not that simple to just think. Oh, I you know, I'm going to go on a diet. I'm going to lose this weight and it's just going to stay off your body has so many complex mechanisms and Pathways to actually restore that weight that it wants you to be at and there's a reason it wants you to be at that weight and that weight is different person to person. So, you know, if you think that just adopting your favorite like And influencers diet and nutrition and fitness habits is going to allow you to have that person's body. It's just not because you have a completely different DNA blueprint than them.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So that is a lot of Social Capital emotional Capital moral capital is still there, but you can destroy and consume this kind of capital as well. Right? So we're working our way is one layer of yeah, I think the evidence is strong. It's not conclusive. I think this the evidence is strong that has been Capital consumption as compared to 20 or 30 years ago. And then there are other forms of capital Social Capital ball Capital emotional Capital which all cultural Achievements have been a lot of the way are the basis of our current economic and social order. And of course, we are destroying the winning at them as well. And that's where I see the two problems in the long run another. I mean, I'm an economist so professionally, of course, I'm I'm interested in material things as you are as well because you are working in the financial markets, but I'm much more concerned in the long run about the destruction of the moral foundations.	0.0

Oh my God that she would be the best partner for him, especially because it's his first season. She's so cool. She's so funny. She's the most humble person like she's like just the greatest human being you know, so I'm like I'm like the best would be for him to get this partner and then I'm like after Good Morning America. Are we still don't know who's With who and then finally we found out and we were on cloud nine. It was just the best feeling ever and it's so great because right away like even at the meet and greet we had a great chemistry together good and it's so funny because there was like a picture for the Good Morning America cast and we happen to be standing all three of us next to each other like partial. Look. It's like our family portrait here like we made this happen. Yeah.	1.0
Associated with that outside of these really like that, you know, not a lot out of body or anything like that, but this is monologue going on in your home. Yeah. It was just I have absolutely no fear of death anymore because I know that death isn't scary, you know, being a parent and being attacked by a shark yet terrifying really but death itself and going on to whatever is next. It's actually quite peaceful and the First thing that I think now is well, the only reason that was was because I had no regrets and I had nothing no thoughts of I should have done this or I should made up with this person. So now it's like, okay. So all I've got to do for next time I die is make sure I feel that exact same way. So now I get to really really live because there is no fear of death. There's no having to hold on to the Mortal coil. I get to be anyone I want to do anything. I want I'm happy and all I have to do is just have no regrets and they loving to everyone and help where I can and now I just really changed the whole direction of my life and my mindset so you're saying is the key to happiness is to just almost died and then live it.	1.0

So this dish right here renders in real time.	1.0
So hopefully that will be launched soon and I guess going back to my be the overall online store idea because I've seen other ones where similar sort of things but bedroom packs around the furniture more than just the the kind of the lighter or the smaller pieces and look. I don't have any experience at all. But my initial response to when I see those is I'm a little Little about how well they would actually do not because it's about I think it's a great idea, but I often wonder what I look at those, you know, some of the prices for the full living room pack or Furniture whether there's actually much demand out there and and given that there's actually a lot of competition as you say retail is can is struggling on this at the moment. I imagine that's the case online as well and I guess it in an of a selfish it could be a time business, but it's kind of sitting as a second priority to for the most of These staging businesses as a second or complementary part of their business. So I guess I'm just wondering if somebody has no idea at all how well these things are near you've just said that you just received quite well. Have you found that it's something that buyers are all I guess. What do you think about others who are doing similar sort of things but in a Furniture space, do you think that they're actually going to be something that given our industry? It's actually received were Lords in demand or or my kind of missing the point a bit.	1.0
It just your body just does it so, it's great what I love about his choreography and he did Grease live is that he creates something that's so iconic like grease you're like, oh, well, I know how this number goes.

Yeah, he's got a lot, you know in the mix so he's someone that is out there working all the time. So I love the shows kind of bringing in like when you guys work with cat Burns a couple weeks ago.	1.0
You know to appeal to the lighter side of things and to the sentimental side of things. I think I'm going to go with Depot Samuel to replace Randall Cobb because you can do a lot of the similar things that Randall Cobb could and I think Matt Le Flore is going to really appreciate a gadget player and he could play inside outside. He can be your returner in special teams. I think that it's a good selection here. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the other four that we talked. About either okay.	1.0
So for this year, so to make sense, however, some of them they do that and like it makes it just opens because they open a lot of the older episodes like that. Yeah, like as I remember I could be definitely wrong. Yeah. I haven't watched any of like the first season a long time.	0.0

You know, you don't want to Buck him right up to the end. But but like a good example of For a how our system earlier in the conversation I mentioned how I learned a lot from Ike's Anki and one of the things that I learned from Mike was with breeding young mares and then breeding your business.

And then there's like a little couch with the TV but the whole place is just it's just absolute like right now, it's like my wife any time she walks in the house. She says this place is a fucking disaster and like seven out of ten times no fun six out of ten times. That's true. Most of the time is just like chill is Not that big a deal relax downstairs is almost always a disaster like every toy they have they pull out. It's everywhere if they eat something down there.

So welcome to the Green Bay Packers daylan machen that a wrap up the six-man draft class for the smartdraft simulation from a draft Network here for 2019 notable players afterwards to the underground forward. Jajuan Johnson to the Browns David long to the Vikings sudden Smith to the Titans Antoine Wesley to the Eagles Darius Slayton to Denver white rate of the Rams. Will Grier going to the Patriots to they maybe get another backup quarterback that could be trade bait in four years. Titus Howard to the Falcons final pick of this for round mock was Michael Jackson from Miami over to Philadelphia. So if there are no trays and in the dream scenario, this would be how the Packers would Shape Up according to what Tyler and I have decided to do Brian Burns goes to 12 and no offense goes at 30 Debo Samuel at 44 one Thornhill at 75 Connor McGovern and 114 and daylan Mac at 118 if That were to be the case and if all these pics were to end up in Green Bay, I would be Beyond ecstatic. I would not sleep very well. I would be full of adrenaline and looking forward to driving up to Green Bay and August for training camp and sitting at the fence watching these guys work in pads and making 2019 one of the more exciting years entering that I've had in a while.	1.0

There's that that movie that break up with Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston where there's a part where like they're having an argument in the beginning and and he's complaining about having to do the decisions and she's like I want you to do the dishes.

Another example is rather Compton Ice Cube was smart. He looked at the country like yo like this thing right where my money at Jerry Heller he's giving them all the all the hoopla ride the runaround Trinkets and shit.

Soapy water, but I realize that some people don't do that. I was watching a little video on Pinterest earlier because I try to to read a lot of cleaning articles and cleaning videos and things to kind of get ideas for the show and make sure that I'm covering everything and that, you know, I'm staying with the trends and it was a video of hacks where they showed like a little holder for your sponge and just some different things to make doing dishes easier.

We took these floaties to this part instead of like a bow instead of anything. We took like this like a little legit like blow up floaty and paddled our way and the floaty was deflating in the middle of the lake at like freaking 12 a.m. And I had a panic attack and like cried and almost drowned and but we made it.	0.0

We recently last year. We made a movie as a short film called paper cutter I wrote Directed it drew is the DP and and we'll talk about that at a later point, but we're now working on our next one together and I'm pretty sure if everything goes like we want it to Drew and I are going to be making movies together for the rest of our lives.

If you have just a bookcase and small children that are just pulling books off the shelf or whatever, maybe move that bookcase to about bedroom. That's what we that's what we did at our old house. We had the bookcase out front and it became kind of a mess now. It's in a bedroom. The kids are older. They're not scattering the books as much but it's still just saves time when straightening the living room that you're not just worried. I'm not just worried about are these books You know lined up correctly or something. They can be a little bit in perfect. If they're just in a child's room as long as the child is happy with how they're organized. You see what I'm saying? So if there's a problem with clutter in your living room, you met our family room.

We saw last season that the way they were able to kind of make her think that her brother was alive is that they were they were faking that her brother was still alive, but now we see that she does have indeed the dead body of her brother in her the basement of this house.	1.0

So the generally the naloxone has a shelf life and like 45 minutes 40 minutes somewhere around there I think and so the opiates will reattach to the ER opiate receptors in your body and then you'll start going on and not again, so it's just exactly what sounds like you're nodding off asleep you're falling asleep. So they could potentially go down again generally will give repeat doses over with them or by that time the hospital will end up giving a repeat dose if they're still willing to stay in the hospital. Some people actually go on the locks on drip in the Bill because they've got such strong opiates in their system.	0.0

We're on equal footing even though we're all watching One Loser on camera, you know, like it's funny like it should be a there should be some sort of relationship and the best dreamers that I see like xqc and everyone know how to use chat in that way.	1.0

Then you get ready. Then you give them the naloxone you bring them up slow. It's way safer. Yeah you then they'll come up they get a little confused. They pull their way out and then they'll start talking to you. Some of them come to the hospital. Some of them don't someone tell us to peace out. But yeah, we want these people to be transported to the hospital or at least if they refuse service to be with somebody to be monitored because Locks on will have a shorter shelf life. It will burn off faster in their system than the opiates.	1.0

Pete Rock true true Metro Boomin shout out the st. Louis Metro Boomin. Definitely. He was part of the the new age sound as well like the the current sound and also want to throw in Tyler the Creator. I think he's very underrated as an as a producer but he's definitely one of my favorites today as long as he's still making music. I just met my best results and I messed with this new sound. He definitely evolved a lot. So those are just so many people that I want to mention. It's definitely a lot more but To the one that I just wanted to to mention besides but the people to flock are you mentioned so it's a lot of good producers man. I just want to say that a lot of good producers back back in the day and and up until today. I know everybody's like looking for the new sound and I guess like right now you say like Pierre Pierre born. This is one of the people who has a lot of sounds that a lot of people emulate take Keith. I feel like he he does a lot of frickin Beast that sound the same to he's finally trying to expand but he would definitely do a lot of a lot of bees that sounded the exact same and I was like what the hell is is but a lot of you trying to lay his stuff. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's as far as well. I can think of right now, but but she also produces man because like I said everyone for y'all, I really think that a lot of these people would sound pretty wack in my opinion a lot of influences our name that man.	1.0

It was a cool little pop up. But I mean it was a cool little pop. It was a biggest show on television, but because I wasn't like entrenched in fashion.

You know, it's one of the highest level caliber competitions. It brings out some of the best competitors in the world the best competitors in the World in nogi, grappling and it's a good time for us to watch what they're doing and try to figure out if the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is changing and I know we've done an episode before on The Meta but I'm just going to do a quick review in case you forgot what that is. So the meta is usually short for the metagame and in it means actually two things in game theory in sports the metagame refers to anything outside of the Actual game that influences the game a good example would be like the crowd the crowd is outside the game but depending on their volume level or you know, whether you're on the home team or the away team, the crowd is a part of the metagame that will influence in some intangible, you know, maybe slight ways the outcome or the performance of The Players. So that's sort of one definition in sports in gaming particularly in Competitive Gaming The Meta is something A little different an acronym and it stands for the most effective tactic available. And when people use the term meta or someone is playing on meta with that means is that the professional level players will be using the most effective tactic available because they're professionals and it's very high stakes and you know, they want to win clearly. when me and you practice rolling in the gym we may or may not be on meta which is some of us may have sort of unique games that work well for us, but they wouldn't work well for other people or players and then some of us may not be competitors or maybe we're casual competitors and we have things that work well, but they wouldn't encounter diminishing returns as you got to the highest levels of the game, or maybe they don't even work well at all, you know, there's a lot of And I've certainly been one of them before where I've fallen in love with moves that when I think about it, they were actually fairly low percentage. But those few times that I would hit it. I'd feel really good about myself, you know, something really exotic like a go-go plot or something like that. No offense. If you're a gogoplata player, I just sort of pick something that came to mind. If you ask an average person what the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is right. Now almost all of them would say like locks that we are kind of in this golden age of leg locks. That have started to come to prominence probably more or less in the last 10 years. But really I'd say in the last, you know, three to five years is when it's really really started to accelerate and people are wondering and I'm certainly wondering whether this is a trend that is going to come and go we've seen Trends sort of come and go in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. There was times when the spider guard was a really hot guard or when Marcelo Garcia was tearing it up in the early 2000s. The butterfly guard was Very popular, you know, those things sort of came and went and then there's other things that they sort of they experienced a peak and then they decline but they still stay in the game The Butterfly guards a great example It's Not Dead by any means in fact the rise of leg lock and leg attack positions has given sort of a Resurgence to the butterfly guard because it's a really good entry for some of those bottom leg attack positions. many people very smart people have recently kind of wondered aloud if the leglock craze has reached its peak and if it's going to start declining now, I was watching the BJ Fanatics brown belt Invitational and Gordon Ryan was kind of talking aloud and it was either him or the other commentator that was with him when he was it was Todd and they were basically saying, you know, they were watching these brown belts and someone said, hey, there's not as much leg locks as I thought they would be and I think it was Gordon said well, you know, People are studying the leglock game very closely. They're learning the defenses and they're not as high percentage as they used to be. So there are certainly not going to be going away. But they are just going to become another technique that you have to do and a TCC is a great chance to sort of test that theory because if there's something that's even slightly higher percentage than everything else you can bet that these world class competitors are going to be employing it. So let's talk about some of the things that we might have observed during a a DCC and whether it's going to start something that maybe lower level competitors can take a cue from first thing. I want to talk about was the dominance of guard players and that something we talked about last week, which is a TCC really penalizes you for pulling guard. However, it does not do that in the first half of the match and I should mention while I'm thinking about it. This is something that I wasn't really I didn't make as clear as I should have in the last podcast which I said if you pull guard in a TC you're penalized but that's not really true. You are allowed to pull guard in the first part of a match. It's after the halfway point that you are penalized from pulling guard. And even there there is an exception, which is I believe in overtime if you're in any overtime, then penalties are in play right off the bat. So if you go into an overtime and you sit to guard then you will be penalized. However, in the face of all that it was fascinating to see that there were several competitors that made the calculation that despite being penalized. It was still actually a net gain for them to take a penalty sit in the guard and work their game some notable examples Paul meow took penalties and over time twice, I believe because he wanted to be in guard and it wasn't just him I know meow is you know, he's a very unique person in Brazilian jiu-jitsu with kind of a legendary guard game, but it wasn't just Tenth Planet Phenom Elvira, she said to guard a couple times believe she was injured in that match. So that makes some sensor that might justify why she did outside the rule set, but even beyond that clearly she was a bottom player and even when the matches her matches were in regulation. She was sitting to guard right away Lachlan geils, he would run to the center of the Matteson he would sit in guard and in the high percentage podcast and on the website, we've talked before about how a lot Lot of these competitions atcc is one of them are structured where it's very difficult to accrue points when you're on the bottom, but despite that these competitors have still figured that they would prefer to be on the bottom because they feel like they have the best chance of getting a submission that way. Another thing that makes this impressive is that in a TCC just like in ibjjf the only way you can score points from the bottom is to sweep. However, unlike ibjjf it's much harder to score points on a sweep in 80cc because there is I think there's the to shoulder rule which is in order for someone to be considered down. Both their shoulders have to be touching the mat. I don't think it's quite like that and ibjjf, I believe it's the three second rule and it's What it allows people to do in a TCC is you can have your butt on the ground, but if you can put your hands behind you and get your shoulders off the mat, then you're not really considered down and that makes a huge difference. So people were commenting in the the commentators booth that even to get a sweep is very challenging because you have to really wrestle to get a sweep. So all of that you would think in abstract would make someone really reluctant to play guard especially when you figured that statistically submissions. Are less likely in a DCC. However, some of the very successful competitors this weekend like Laughlin geils for them. It was no question. They sat to guard immediately and started working. So what does that mean with the meta guard players are alive and well, they're not going anywhere at the Sip that the high level at high percentage. We still recommend If you're sort of a newer competitor that you take an approach of getting on top and and pursuing positional dominance so that you can score points. However, if it's no point scenario Then by all means play guard. That's what some of the best people in the world who are doing. And what kind of guards are these players using? Well, there were two guards that really stood out in the weekend. And I remember at one point me and Roy we were on a call together because in real-time to two guys who are trying to watch three mats worth of action, and I said to him men seem like to you like you you're seeing a lot of me Shield half guard and he said absolutely so the one guard that we noticed especially in day one of the tournament was a lot of people were using these Old half guard and and this includes some of its variation. So to get really technical there's the knee shield and then there's the Z guard which is generally like a lower kind of me shield. And then one thing that I noticed with Lachlan and with Craig Jones is that they don't play a close half guard like you would think with if you were like getting a dogfight half guard where you wanted an underhook and getting a dog fight or certainly like a lockdown half guard, which is very very close. They were playing this sort of distance. Eating half guard and the reason especially for Lachlan that he was doing that was he wanted to invert from half Garden to attack like so that was a kind of guard that I really noticed that people that were trying to set up leg attacks. They like that nice Shield half guard also in the women's division. You saw particularly some of Gabby Garcia's opponents opponents were making really good use of that knee Shield, but that was for a different reason. That's because it's a good way to keep large people offer you and this is something I can personally attest to you know rooster wait until And the second big guard that we saw in maybe this was even more dominant than the knee Shield half guard was the butterfly guard. This is sort of the the Gordon Ryan's kind of go to guard lock on geils really liked the butterfly half guard and it's interesting because even within it they have some kind of different takes on it. So, you know Lachlan seemed to go like a lot more knees out. Gordon was more like knees Point towards the ceiling but one thing that Gordon consistently did and I'm not sure why he did this was a lot of times he put his his hand directly behind them and he was on his backhand or he was on his back elbow and other competitors weren't necessarily doing that with her butterfly guard and it's no surprise both Lachlan and Gordon are leg lock guys Gordon has become a lot more well-rounded but you know he's obviously really skilled at leg locks and people that like to go for leg locks should be playing butterfly guard because butterfly guard offers some really good options for getting too eggs inside are even doing inversions which a lot of people were doing this weekend This episode of the podcast is brought to you by anchor FM which is how you're hearing the high percentage podcast right now.

She is like wait, do you only send yours on Snapchat or because they disappear or do you text them? First of all, I don't really send them to anyone if we're being very clear. I send them to you I keep them for myself to look at because I'm like, wow. Damn. I look good. Yeah for the very small number of people that have received them. They had been on Snapchat. There's only been one person that they've been texted to and that's because he doesn't have Snapchat.	1.0
It is mind-blowing. Yes. I can't even believe I get to do this I get paid to go and do things that I would pay to do and then I get a little home movie out of it and everyone gets to watch it around the world. Yes. Absolutely, amazing eyesight. They pay for me to do incredible things that people don't get to do I swim with great white sharks without a cage where she does that although it is kind of like every year makes me wonder how Discovery Channel's going to try and kill me this year and last year. I did a survival show with a British Special Forces Guy where we parachuted from 15,000 feet directly into the Pacific Ocean for 44 hours with no food. No water surrounded by sharks was the fairgrounds or else? No, not the Bear Grylls last night. It was a guy called James glancing who was a royal Marine 44 hours at the ocean. Yeah. That was it's a long time. These aren't you can understand how hard it is when you're bouncing around the ocean. You're tired. You're hungry you're thirsty and trying to cut. Hole in the butt of your wet suit while you're moving around too. So you can poop student suit. You can't sleep in the suit get a rash. Yeah, I thought that was the second one the E before they blew up our boat off the coast of the Bahamas and we drifted through the ocean again through the Atlantic surrounded by Oceanic whitetip sharks, which are the sharks blame for the biggest shark attack in history the at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. So there was Reportedly 300 American Sailors were eat by these sharks. So it was kind of you know, I wasn't just a survival thing was a message about shark conservation and what to do if you're stranded and you lose your boat, but also telling the story of these Sailors, so it was a really great thing to be a part of was there any part of you?	1.0

I went back to work full-time after six months. Wow. Are you serious? Yeah. So one of my greatest be the will the greatest be wasn't about Losing the leg in the hand. It was about losing my career because it's called it was it was everything to me. I loved it and I fought so hard to achieve that and I was terrified of losing it and so instead of letting that fear crippled me. I used it as a motivator and I let it push me into die with you know, just two days after my legs chopped off. I'm trying to do one-handed pull-ups on the bar above my bed so that I can start training and then I went home and I had one of my best friends who Really was a savior. He quit his job up north moved in with me and act as a carer and cooked for me and clean for me and drove me around. I really couldn't have done it without him. You can't undervalue the just the smallest amount of support in these situations. And so I was in the gym at the army base every single day training learning to use my body again working with the prosthetic companies to try and develop weightlifting Prosthetics. And so yeah over a year and a half to have three More surgery to remove bone spurs and that was always very hard progressing and then going in for surgery and going back to square one again. So that was pretty emotionally draining and having to get back on the drugs again, and I was self-administering Oxycontin and own which is the fast-acting oxy Gabapentin, which is a nerve blocker antidepressants for the nerve pain sleeping tablets. And so I could smash as much of that in my head as I wanted, but I kind I knew what it was like to live in a cloud. Cloud from when I was a teenager and I was smoking heaps a weed and was working in Hospitality doing other party drugs and I swore to myself. I wouldn't go back to that person. And so I got off the drugs as fast as I could got back to work and just started trying to prove myself that I deserve to be there.	1.0
I haven't but we just had our first rehearsal for the opening number and he's so cool. He's just so cool to work dick. It's like boom boom boom. Boom. Boom done very fast with your great-aunt just he has like this break flow about him to you know, like he does bits and pieces of choreography, but then when he fuses them together, it just works like everything kind of just flows one piece into the other and you kind of don't even have to think about it.	0.0
Honestly just to finish with you the past few weeks on just yeah, I don't have a time. It's called in fines just finish it and hopefully enjoy it. Let's go I could of course. I am not they don't get caught up in English applied to the stuff that I guess I did a bit easier and I did push it but I have to say I didn't do that. I didn't enjoy it because I was so focused on my time and my pay is looking at my watch. I would rather be somewhere in enjoy it. So yeah, hope you just to have a bit of fun. Yeah cat other people it seems in one piece. It's funny how I mean I'm guilty of this massively.	1.0
All the oceans go out from from an academic point of view. I would say it's a continuation in modern economics of the realist philosophy philosophical tradition. All right. So in philosophy of this old debate this all disagreement about the question with that any universals and then this is a real dispute that goes back to the Greeks and then in the Middle Ages, so the The idea that the question was whether there are causal connections or concept more generally speaking that apply at all times and places. Okay, and on this ground, so do people believe that this is true. They are called the real risks and the people who believe that there is no such thing that all stood all times in all places, but all things have we can know only related to particular historical conditions of time and place and We'll have to be identified in and again new and all general concepts that we could ever use are just some sort of Temporaries summaries of what we currently know and currently think well, these people are called the nominal this and the positivist and in the 20th century, the the nominalist have hijacked economics, not only economics but you can always in particular and the only guys left standing on. On the realest cam. Well, there might be a few others, but the most important group left standing is the the austrians. So the austrians think that there is such a thing as economic loss. I saw the call who connections that whole to at all times and all places. If you increase the money supply. Well, then the price it will tend to increase at all times and all places. It's not just to today in France or in the UK, but all in all countries and all at all times. So that's the option position. That's really what makes them. Particular and the others so they don't believe this kind of thing and there's a second thing that also came that has complicated things on top of this namely the idea that they are constant quantitative relationships now, that's that's not at all the same thing, but that's what the the most other economists are looking for right there. So they think that in the social field in the economy there is that Loss of any kind in this should be of the quantitative thought such as the law of gravity and so on that we know from from physics, so there should be a Content constant quantitative relationship between different variables that we have trusted in and again, like one example might be the money's stock quantity of money on the one hand and the price I love you on the other all the austrians don't believe that there is such a constant quantitative. Because the money supply is just one among other factors that influences the price level and it does influence the price level only through the subjective values of all people all Market participants. So Market participants that they are videos that doubt with the faculty to choose and they might change their opinions and I changed the values might change from one moment to the other and of course, they're different one from one individual to another so that makes it there can be no such thing as a constant quantitative relationship. The only thing that is constant is indeed that there is a relationship between the money supply and the price level they're positively related but there is no exact quantitative relationship. I'm afraid that was quite a little bit but you ask me I know it's absolutely right.	0.0

I didn't know what to expect. I think you know because originally like when my mom was telling me I was hesitant, you know, I was you know, I don't need to meet him and you know, she was just like no just meet your father and I should you know, and and when I think about it now and my mother and I have never Discussed this but when I think about it now, you know, some of that was probably for her as well like yo, I had this kid together married for a couple of years like you ain't been in his life and which would make sense to me. I get it like at least see him once you know, but for me, I really didn't have any expectation, you know, and It you know, it's a it's a weird thing, you know, but for me, I took all of those emotions and I turned them into fuel a really transformed all of those. I guess you could call them negative feelings and I transformed it into fuel, you know, and and and I also use that you know, I felt like I'm the man of the house. I gotta protect you. I gotta protect my mother. I'm gonna make sure she good, you know, and I took it and ran.	1.0
Well what I didn't like is at the end Miley's like I'm you know, I'm still mad at you but like I'm not going to like say I hate you forever and then they were like, you know what problem solved let's be nice to each other like um, no, that's not how problems work and Um, if you actually if that milk because if that was like if they had the mindset of like I want to be nice for Miley sake that wouldn't have happened in the first place. They were you don't all of a sudden get that mindset after you've done something bad. They did not care about her like they acted like they really cared about her that night, but they didn't if they didn't really care about her at all because they couldn't put aside their differences for like 10 minutes.	0.0

It just didn't work. I think we were just like so stressed about time when you're home.

Absolutely. I got into it my dad a little bit, you know going against his beliefs. He you know wants me to be financially secure and his own belief is I have to be in the medical field where I have to do something that related to succeed but then I think really the bigger picture for him was just me want him wanting me to get out my comfort zone and not settle for mediocrity, but my paycheck does not define that. You know and once I kind of stay true to myself, I'm much more like my mom. We're both very emotional people and she followed her passion. She loves what he does. She does. She definitely has moments of high stress, but at the end of the day, you know, she's not waking up or having like anxiety to come into work on Monday. She went, you know went through that phase for 20 years of her life where she was working for a company Sunday night. You know, she have to wake up the next morning 5:30 6 o'clock wouldn't get home till seven stuck in traffic. Have to make dinner for the kids only get 30 minutes to an hour with her kids. And I remember being kid always wanting that time with her, you know, like where's mom like, you know, and it was tough but you know, sometimes tragedies our disguises blessings and seven years ago when she got late 7 or 10 years ago. I don't know when she got laid off from her job. She just decided to follow her heart and open her own catering business and now, you know by the by the blessings of God and the Lord she's Families doing well, you know and I know we're very humbled for all the opportunities but you know, I'm just really happy that she can lead right she followed she's doing what she loves.

Why do you want to finish a track we fundamental to the success of actually finishing in the track? And sometimes not knowing. Can be very good reason for being stuck. So right this moment if you have a track that you haven't finished for a while, but you don't know how to finish or you just can't finish it. Ask yourself a question. Why do I want to finish this track? Because maybe you don't. And that will be a great knowledge because you can actually move on and finish something that you truly want to finish.	1.0

Yeah, this one was. Not as dramatic, I guess though. I did want to share. You know, I'm flying back from San Diego on Thursday and like they announced right before takeoff that there would be no Wi-Fi and I'm like, here we go again, like let me put out to the world that I'm not going to have Wi-Fi for the next handful of hours just so that when they inevitably trade Francisco Lindor and I'm just silent and not doing any reporting. It's not my fault and then I realized about I don't know. Most of the way into the flight that United has that they have that I message option. So you turn on their Wi-Fi and you of iMessage so I had nothing else but I had iMessage so I turned it on and you and some other people have texted me. You just said Bill Dance and Eddie a statue and I'm like, oh my God, they traded Linder and they got a hall from the Dodgers like and this is seriously happening happening now, and I texted you back and I said, All right, I think well it was in the Chicago. So I had a layover in Chicago. So it was on the Chicago part of the flight and you know that flights like 45 minutes. Yeah, and I think I had 25 minutes left in the flight and I'm like do I need to pay the 1099 for Wi-Fi for the you know, even though I'm gonna have to put away my laptop in 10 minutes and you're like no calm down. It's some knucklehead who covers the Falcons on the radio who comes out with this room, but I was pretty panicked there for a couple of Minutes and I thought we were going to have a legitimate part 2 to the annual tradition of not having Wi-Fi in a cross-country flight after the winter meetings.	1.0

I will have the upper hand on confidentially. And as he changed and as he chased James Conrad and the other survivors of the research that I've mentioned said to Skull Island Earl Cole tried to sacrifice himself by arming several grenades before having the massive creature tried to eat him to both creature up. However, it's called Apple didn't fall for this and he batted up against the cliff as a grenade went off killing him as the skull devil. Finally reached the rest of the crew calling appear to just in time to start with a large Boulder as the crew ran to safety and then the and then thus called overturns. Devil turned his focused to Kong counting on him and gripping his throat with his Jaws called in the skull devil could take them to brutally wrestle puddle and bite each other until the skull down Force Conga to a shipwreck with a blow from his tail where what he had came became entangled to the chains.

Know'st was to start this movement and get people to realize the good another people and when there's one there are these horrible events that happen whether it happens to a person it happens to a building and happens to an area. It's hard to to see at the moment what that you know, where the good can come from it right? It's hard to see that because it just feels so awful. But I think that I think that what you're saying is we have to Look for look for the positive that can come from it. Even how painful that is. Look for that positive and then and take action as a result of what you see that that is DD an awesome way to say it and an awesome.	1.0

I you know, that's a very common plot of a kids show like you look at I don't know if you remember this, I'm gonna pull out Nickelodeon. Sorry that this is a Disney podcast, but there's no sort of Drake & Josh where they do the same thing like Drake doesn't like a girl. More so he pretends to like be really disgusting to like get her to not like him. So I guess I think I'm used to heat like a spaghetti dinner. It's like I don't know but I feel like I'm very used to like that plot device which like again. It hadn't no it's not my favorite. But like it didn't bother me, I guess.	0.0

And with that being said, I still feel like I'm practicing my technique and I Teach for a living So and I've had people who've never danced before a day in their life. They have regular office jobs and they just come to me because they want to just just Unleash the Beast with it, you know, so I do have a lot of like gentleman who come in who want to learn how to properly ballroom dance because they want to surprise your wives. That's so sweet and they end up staying and actually taking their wives to the lessons and improving. So I feel like I have so much experience with people who have never danced before and Making them into really beautiful dancers or into just a dancer when you think you can't you know, so I already have that experience. But it I would love to really get to show my personality as well because I do love meeting new people and seeing how like we can work together and stuff like that. So definitely it would have definitely been fun to work with a celebrity partner season 29.	1.0

Hi, this is Mary HK, Troy and you're listening to Hey, cool life a micro pot about mental health and creativity. Hmm. It is January the 23rd 2019 and this is episode 22 in reality. It is actually the evening of the 22nd. But um I'm a very early morning tomorrow. So I am trying to record it tonight and seeing how it goes. I've already done that thing where I fussed too much and premeditated too much. So I've tried recording it once before and I didn't like the results and I was having this Stern conversation with myself being like the whole agreement was that you Just deliver the first Pancake no matter how misshapen and raw the dough but then the sort of staunch like determination with which I refuse to let myself even like mess with it felt really ungentle.	0.0
That's good. That's that's and it really helped me a lot to to hone my skills and they are really forgiving right, but I know I need more so I keep studying keep mimicking the greatest coach there is and then I went to L2 it opened up my eyes from some. I'm more and it's really just trying and error. It's like you could never really have one good shot even up to today like always make mistakes. Like I always ask myself. How did the classroom? Oh, I should have done that much better. I should have do this to make it more safer stuff like that, right and keep learning Active Learning. So and then after a year I moved here to this. Goin Fishin afternoon. Yeah after a year were right around 40 members. It says yeah, if you really want to do this we're just going to do it right get a good place that you could feed enough people and to and have more room to grow so we found this place and yeah we moved here in 2016 October exactly what over 15 we got the Kia Soul.	1.0
Let's see interior defense Supply and Kaylin Saunders. I do not see him. Let me go through quickly through the draft. I didn't go through every name. So let me deal with check really quick. Kalin Saunders went off the board to the Indianapolis Colts at pick 89 at pick 89.	0.0

Because you were horizontal stripes her one day. It's changed my vibe dude, as soon as the camera goes off like squeak puts on a tie just so you can fall asleep peacefully.	1.0
Now that's that's yeah. I think I think I mentioned before you know in the last two years, especially I've seen the change in agents attitudes towards it but at the same time there's been a lot more businesses and people entering the industry and especially in Capital Cities. I think it's it's a very low barrier to actually enter the industry given you have these higher options or you know, I'm simplifying at a lot. So I'm being overly simplistic, but it is as simple as You can convince somebody to use you to style their home. You can do it tomorrow, you know, you can you can go to a higher company if you're in a capital city and you don't have to own anything. You don't have to actually outlay any costs other than your time obviously to build a business beyond that takes a lot more commitment and energy and cats and all those things. But you know in terms of setting up day one to test it's very easy to actually put your toe in the water if you were to go and like and I should also clarify that and say, you know, it took us a couple of Months before or phone calls and meetings before got our first job. So it's not as simple as that, but you know in I guess as you say young industry with low barrier to at least enter in the early years, it makes sense that we're seeing a lot of businesses pop up.	1.0
So it's it's safe.	1.0
This is fun.	1.0
I would actually allow you to have those Twizzlers now and there is an interesting reason why because intuitive eating believes that when you put foods off-limits like when you create hard rules about what you can and can't have what's happening on a on a instinctual level as that, you're just actually creating a stronger desire to have I've got food, right? It's like the classic kid with the cookie jar situation. Look what happens when Mom leaves and the cookie jar is now unguarded right like the kids will try to eat as many as possible in order to like load up before Mom gets back.	1.0
So talking about the championship game. Now, what was your mindset like going into the game where you nervous or excited where you calm? Sorry Amanda?	1.0
You made it to the fire.	1.0
I feel like now it's just infrastructure right now. It's like tournaments now. It's like making maybe matchmaking more viable taking the cheaters out. I know that's been a big problem for a while.	1.0
Yeah, well, I think that is a really good point and it still is intuitive because when we make certain decisions about what we eat, we're always weighing our values against each other. So in the moment if you like, what are you going to value with the decisions that you make around food? So are you valuing convenience and ease or are you on another situation or another day valuing like feeling good in your body or feeling like one day is it spontaneity? JT and then the next day. It's like Integrity because you told yourself you were going to you know, eat a certain way and so it's okay for those values to change on a day-to-day basis and you always need to check in with yourself again to figure out like what am I what value am I honoring with this decision around my food? Also. It's like we all just have we all have different values and different priorities and you know, I'm a chef. I'm somebody who loves to cook so I know you would always say like you're so not lazy. I actually think it's fun to make my own cashew milk and I enjoy the taste if you don't it's okay not to do all those things, but can you find you know, can you still find balance and challenge yourself to maybe step out of your comfort zone a little bit if you do prioritize your health and if you do want to take care of your body without it being like a chore because if it's a chore, you're just not going to do it ever or stick to it, right?	1.0
This is about double. Yeah. Yeah, it's more than ready to uh, 4400. Well, that's that's not far behind the actually that's great. Sorry. Like that's really what we haven't done anything at all last in the last six days. I have done 10K like just be the case. We'll fix that ready for black or will hopefully on Thursday said yeah, how you feeling about that? Well if the moment I had a chat with we had family discussion about yesterday or the day before and so we just went through cutoff times and my wife said to me five k's an hour you can warp that prong outlet and so that put the at this armor wasn't feeling very motivated. And sometimes I think the more wife doesn't like my running and then every so often she says something like that like just pull your finger out and do the work so Yes, I was actually very good with motivational and although I didn't have a very good not last thought I did run you stay and I'll probably run tonight with how I feel right now. So I look it will be 23 hours instead of what I would have originally liked but I think I'll get it right now. That's my thought. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with 23 hours is still covering that distance and it's an amazing amazing face. Yes, you should Fun. What do you mean to be? I'm happy. It won't be this horse. Yeah. Well, I'm hoping it doesn't pull with rain because a couple of years ago it rained all day and that was just that was not fun. I don't know. I wish I liked riding in the rain.	1.0
Hello neon hair and red plastic disc. Yeah, not a good cop great description. I love thank you.	1.0
Stuff will just come out better. I just well, I think you're right.	1.0
I already loved movies, you know the ones that I watched as a kid over and over again or you know rid of the Lost Ark Goonies like and so in Terminator the Exterminator, which my mother bless her soul. Let me watch as a child. I never scart. I was scarred somebody enriched as well. And so when Terminator 2 like the big SQL is coming out as like I couldn't wait to see it. So I actually went with my parents and sod and the movie blew me away, you know, not just in terms of visuals, but in terms of the storytelling like the story structured in such a different way that I'd never seen before like you want to talk about, you know blowing Minds wide open like that's what happened to me to the point where R. That was when I first like picked up like one of the one of the movies I think there's a movie magazine called Premier that I used to read. And that's when I started picking up that kind of stuff and looking into what actually went on behind the scenes to bring that to everybody and that's when I realized like I think I think I have some stories. I want to tell I like I want to like make something I want to put it on the screen you were enriched and obviously all this beautiful picture you were engulfed in the magazine.	1.0
What when I cry now when you let down when you're in the dark, it's interesting because what I was going to say, there is like when I go for a training run, I generally go for a training run to go in unless in letting you know like out for at the speed session or something and then you know, nothing happens my brains just blank but like if I if I'm where I generally go for a run. That's the reason I like to go running is to going woods, but when I'm right See, I spend meetings far too much time going inwards. And so that's when I like to chat to you know, someone else that I'm racing with and like a hilly course is brilliant for that because on a hill that apart from the elites there aren't too many people who run them. So even though you're puffing up a hill you can actually get you know, a broken conversation going and generally you'll pass like once you 10 10 caves in Two arrays generally then sitting with all the people you probably going to spend most of the rest of the race with and so you get to know people pretty well. And so you can you know, like they can pull you out and you can pull them out and I remember my strongest memory ever was a guy that I was passing and he was out of gels and he didn't realize it he asked if I could take a gel out he got to the stage where he was so wrecked. That the concept of taking his pack off and being out of jail was too much and I gave him one of my gels because he actually run out and there was no way that he was 15 case the next checkpoint and that giving him in my gel made me run faster than if I'd use the gel myself. Yeah because you have someone yeah, and it's and it helped him and after the race he came and thanked me and said I wouldn't you know, you would have never finished the rice if it wasn't for that. Yell at that moment. And yeah, that's probably my favorite memory of racing, you know in all my running. So that's that's my thoughts are going in and out and that's what's so beautiful about an altar and Ultra is it's an entire life in one quick run. Really? Everything is Chandni you end up crying end up hurting you end up falling you end up cheering you sing. You don't seem like there's just Everything in there and that's that's why I love it. So well, I guess I about Lauren's music choice to is she likes rock and roll. I keep trying to convince her to listen to an alternative to rock and roll, but I haven't convinced yet. Well, I do like lots of different kinds of music, but I think you like the Techno stuff which I'm not such a big bet on to say if you scolding you talk idiom. Okay, I don't even know what this is when I'm running.	1.0
Do you have any input there it to me when it comes to the safeties. It depends on what you want with them. Do you want the kind of steady solid all-around player? Beyonce Thompson who who's in who's just kind of good player, but he's more around it or do you want the ball skills of Thornhill former Corner who is really really strong and coverage and he's a guy who's going to create turnovers for you guys. That's the biggest thing for me with the receivers Hollywood Brown does worry me with an injury and he's also very very small and slight so I wonder if that could be a recurring thing Deebo Samuel would be my choice because as if I was going to go receiver because his route running is so Dynamic and I ever You came at the Senior Bowl. He was absolutely making top-flight corners of foolish out there. And and I think he's a guy who stuck drop because he didn't have the greatest year at South Carolina, but he's another solid player for so for me to be down between Samuel and Thornhill, but I'll defer to you if you want you to be one of those okay with you lean toward.	0.0

That's fine. Just keep in mind a few pointers on one designing practices. Remember to keep explaining to a minimum unless it is a drill or concept which needs clarification and will be used multiple times throughout the season make sure skills practiced relate to any games played or are emphasized during scrimmages. Only start with foundational skills and build your way up. You can see where your players are at a might catch a few mistakes that would go unnoticed if you just jump into more advanced drills. Okay that was chapter for the beginning of your season from coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season. I hope you all enjoyed this longer episode from get the pancake. If you're interested in getting yourself a copy of the full book, which is 10 chapters long and it takes you from your decision to coach all the way up to starting ear to it is available on Amazon both as an e-book and now in paperback. Just because it's on Amazon doesn't mean you can only read it on your Kindle. You can also get the Kindle app for your iPad. But if you are like me and many of the other coaches here the paperback version is great my intention for writing. This book was a to give you a heads-up about what's coming. If it's your first season and be to serve as a reference point for you throughout your season, I recommend you read through the whole book before you begin coaching, but then keep checking back throughout the season because things will come up that you're not expecting or you may forget about it in the beginning of the season and then in the middle of the Season you realize that you need to talk about burnout or something with your players. This book is great. For those of you who are coaching middle school high school or Club volleyball for the first time youth volleyball coaches.

Well, I think what we've noticed and talking when owners and studying. This is just a lack of vision at the onset of the project if owners and contractors alike are coming into a particular project opportunity and they're aligned on what possible from an off-site standpoint that really bodes well for maximizing the prefabrication or off-site potential on the project. It's I think it's what works hard as if there's a basic project that gets design and then a contractor or a contractor in a designer than says all right, what part of this can we can we manufacture off-site since having that alignment going in from the beginning with owner the engineer and a contractor all aligned saying this is this is really how we want to achieve this any kind of modular design any kind of prefabrication off-site construction really originates in the planning period of the construction process, right?	1.0

okay, so chapter 16 of Genesis had me kind of laughing because it it reminds me of just how we are as wives sometimes but this chapter is so rich in just how it can relate to today and that's why I love the Bible man because there is like if you you just read through just to get through right to just like check it off your list. Then you are missing you are missing some good stories on you are missing some good lessons. And and so let's dig in. Okay chapter 16 is the birth of Ishmael Ishmael. You know what I'm just gonna apologize beforehand for how I pronounce some of these names, but basically it's the birth of Who comes from sarai's servant? So Abram who later is named Abraham and Sarai who's later named Sarah. So Abram and Sarai have been told by God in earlier chapters. Well Abram has been told that he's going to be a father of a bunch of Nations. Right but they are very old and Sarai decides to take matters into Her own hands because she is so old and wants to have a baby that she gives hag are her servant to Abram. Now when I first read this or like when I've heard about this in the past, I was always like how scandalous like that was. Okay, you know because it doesn't really condemn them in the Bible. It's not like God comes down and it's like how dare you sleep with another woman when you're married Abram, right? Like but here's the thing like it's not right. It's not right. It God does not say that that is okay. But Sarai gives her servant to her husband, which was not uncommon back in that day and It was actually a common practice of that day. If a married woman could not have children. She would have like a substitute wife. So one of her servants have a child with their husband to produce heirs in Abram and Sarai we know had wealth right livestock and land and all of that. So and I believe it's in a previous chapter of Genesis that Abrams like I have no errors like my servants gonna inherit it or my servants kid. You know, whatever. So let's that's like an overview right but this is so rich in lessons. Let's get into it. So Genesis 16 starts with now Sarai Abrams wife had not been able to Bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. So sir. I said to Abram the Lord has prevented me from having children go and sleep with my servant perhaps I can have children through her and Abram agreed with surprise proposal. So Sarai Abrams wife. Took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. This happened Ten Years After Abram had set settled in the land of Canaan. So we all know what happened right Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant, but when hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt. So let's back up though really quick to Abram going and sleeping with Hagar. Abram was acting in line with the custom of the day. Right? So it was common for that to happen. But his action showed a lack of faith that God would fulfill his promise. So what are something this is like the question that I asked myself what are some things that are acceptable today by the world, right? What are some things that are in line with the custom of today?	1.0

She doesn't understand what's happening. All she thinks is that her son is getting like a tact and so she's just coming to His defense like I'm not gonna like argue with her something and I said something like that was like I'm not gonna argue with her or say anything mean to her. She's just a mom were looking out for her child, whatever and I was kind of the end of that and then it came out that like she was hacked or something like they hacked her account to do all this.

Yeah, and that's one thing we did. I mean that's why we put them on our trucks initially as well as is. Yes. Anybody can be trained to use this cat like there is young children that know how to use these kits and can can administrate them. However, you know for us responding we needed a plan. We need an operational guideline for a second as Bowser for us because I've seen it numerous First I'm the and I'm sure many other people have is where you're either in a residence or your Patty somebody down or you're trying to get them into the back of the ambulance or it's in a car accident where there's a lot of paraphernalia left over or sitting close to them. So if you get exposed to that and we need a plan for our size, so if we're not carrying it, we're not prepared then if we come across something and we need to administer it it's still there for us and you're totally covered under the Good Samaritan.

So, I mean that feels good something that fills professional and we did I think a pretty good job we learned a lot and that's definitely stuff we can talk about probably throughout This podcast as long as we do it we learned a lot we made mistakes. We did some things right and so we made a lot of mistakes and did some things right. We did a lot of things right and we made some mistakes but we learned from all those mistakes and what we're going to apply to the next movie jump see which we want to be really I wanted to be Top Notch.

What do you do and it's actually what he's been doing. He's looked at the world. And for example, he he said right there are children dying in Africa because they can't get clean water. I'm going to solve this problem and he writes to the universities in America gets the greatest Minds together funds a few projects which are completely crazy and last week we had on the podcast a guy called Alan Steel who recommended a book called Loom shots, which is about crazy ideas that can change the world and this all ties in with what exactly what he was doing at what he's doing and and he solved the problem. He's created this sanitation system that is just completely revolutionary and I don't want to spoil it for you for other people are going to watch it, but it's exactly what you just said. He's gone out there. He's looked at problems and he said right I'm going to use my money. I'm going to use my brain and I'm going to fix it and It's changed my opinion of him completely. I've heard a lot of respect for him now, but that this book also I think is is is going to be one that I'm going to read because it's it sounds like it's saying the same thing so Tim, what do you have? Well first you have to endure sceeto's selection because Man's Search for meaning is the most inspiring book I've ever read and it's extremely extremely affecting in every sense of the word. So to go from the sublime to the Nicholas I'm gonna go for well, I'm here too because there's a connection between them. The first is Bohemian Rhapsody. And so I saw recently always sort of thought. Yeah Freddie Mercury. Yeah higher pick which is nothing really very special but it's very entertaining. Yes, hugely crowd-pleasing entertainment. The critics hated it the good excited it while it's great. It's quite it's eminently watchable and for anyone of a certain age, I mean queen was just all over the 70s and most of the a 80s now I never bought the queen record, but but you have to admit they they gave good rock. Oh definitely. I was very lucky to go to all the early Queen concerts. I really yeah, you are privileged. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I just I would go to other gigs that my friends were talking about and I would say God this is this is rubbish, you know, because I'm my first few get wise to go to the Marquee Club in London and say a lot of small bands which were great. But my first Stadium gig was a queen gig so I was like, Let me spoil on the Waterworks tool and when it came to Live Aid I wasn't surprised I was like the other band States quote great and some other bands were great. But you know, I'd like Sade playing bass line for 10 minutes before they actually got into their song Along Comes Queen and just like blows everyone knows everyone knows everyone else away in that I knew that this is what they would do because I'd seen them before the other. The other one is another Netflix production called the spy with Sacha Baron. Aaron Cohen, I don't know if you know the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen Dido. He has it Borat and yeah things but this is as far as I'm aware his first serious acting role. There is a major first. It's a very good film. It's a series of day. I think it's a six part series on Netflix very very the true life story of a Israeli spy who infiltrated the the top level of the Syrian government quite incredible true life story, but Sacha Baron Cohen is outstandingly good in this and the reason I mention the connections because I believe Sacha Baron Cohen was originally lined up to play for any Mercury. Yes. He was yes, he's I think he's brilliant the Common Thread here because we've talked about this a bit in the past is it seems easier much easier for good Comics to become good serious dramatic actors either way around I believe so I'd interesting. I mean, I think it's much harder to do what he's done in the past, you know his comedic work than and I I wouldn't be surprised if his acting is absolutely outstanding, but but Guido look, thank you so much for your time, and there's something	1.0

Yeah, and I was like, I don't know if I can do this without my husband. He's like well bring him with you. I was like, well it's hard because we have all those like students in New York. You can't just leave all our students and you know, so we really had to think about it and Pasha right away said you're going yep and he held down the fort while you were on tour with the your students and did teachers like well, let's not say anything yet, and I told her a red rose. I don't know like we'll see and then once again when he asked me I was like, all right. Well, let's do this like will do the tour and so super fun.	1.0
The yeah. Anybody does be a production like has had that feeling it's probably another I had shot a wedding and it was the ceremony part of it and shooting on Mini DV back then I think I was on like an Excel like a cannon Excel to sick, right so At the time Blake by far this is the far the coolest and read every child. That was very by far and the I don't know what happened. But the tape was just trashed like I'd put it into like the other capture at real-time weird. Yeah, you gotta play it on TV. You have to walk away. Yeah as it's going through the acts like if it's an hour of Tapley, you have to wait for an hour for to go into the computer. Yeah and like you want to talk about I do not miss that. Oh boy me neither man. So the I mean the biggest sinking feeling in the world is realizing have to Talk to the client and say hey, I lost your wedding. Sorry luckily in this case in this particular case. I was very lucky and and they were actually very very cool. And I think we saw I think we had a second camera but in no audio is like we could see it was sort of Salvage but like not really kind of my me so, okay. So anyway, so after after doing wedding videos, I'll speed this up because actually we are cruising on time the first three minutes of this was was us trying to record. Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point at least three minutes maybe I'm more than that good. Yeah, the first 42 takes so this interesting keep talking to me. So don't mind if I do it's a podcast it probably makes sense.	1.0

Do you think well, I mean what happened if the Central Bank does no longer increase the money supply so its own money. Yeah, right or if it doesn't increase it enough so that people who have been counting on the stronger increases. I left in the cold as we've seen lat. Actually quite with the liquidity issues on new are so if something of this at this can spill over right and that's also the reason why the Central Bank step very vigorously in and prevented that interest rates would rise further and panic would Spread spread and so on so under these circumstances, there's no definition of a meltdown, right? But of course my solving a problem springing from debt with more credits. You do not provide a true solution. Yes problems. Right? I mean, this is something that most people are understood that we are in a very tired are paradoxical situation. They were trying to solve problems bringing from debt with there are more credit. This of course observe because we are just reproducing the problems that we had in the past on a higher level almost exactly as Marx put it in the capitalist system reproduces his own problems on a larger scale because it's not difficult to guess.	0.0
Yeah, probably this was Frank. This was founded the main advantage of this fact is that Switzerland so small? That's a it's a such a small. It's not even an exit door. Right? It's it's a it's a rabbit hole. Not many people get through this. All right, so Swiss franc is booty best and the problem with this Swiss is a leech bite because the Swiss this still appreciate stable money that appreciates strong money. It's just some of those sweets and industrialists. They don't like it because they see the increased pressure on that on the on the export business. The Swiss themselves. They like in Japan is different stories. Japan has the advantage so much bigger countries. So it's a much bigger economy. But the Japanese if I understand this correctly, I don't know Japanese mentality at all. But from what I see portrait you and always the media is that they are adamant desperate to create inflation. That's definitely not the case with Japan. Excuse me with was Switzerland. Therefore I would say because the it's a more sane intellectual environment moral environment.	1.0
So I don't mean I even I like Battlefield I've liked it for a while and it's one of those things that you know, one thing that I always. He's whenever I start up Apex Legends.

Exactly and I think I think a lot more people will be critical of the second season, like hoping that they kind of learn from how the community has provided feedback about the first season because I know I think the consensus overall There's this disappointment and liverworts and I think a lot of people don't like that 20% of the battle pass is just all those badges those number badges that no one's going to use. Yeah. Yeah.	0.0
That was so so again my take on it from all the features that I end up liking the majority of the songs. He clearly had the best out of the Three Amigos. I'm gonna give him a 3. I'ma get my three just just based off of off of that along because I really thought especially after the delay the first delay. I was like man, I don't know about this. Like, what is he really trying to do was he trying to save face what else is really going on with it? But I think all in all once it finally came out. I thought they did was a pretty a pretty decent album and I enjoyed it for the most part for what it is the production to I forgot to mention. Yeah production will definitely good for ducks with Delphine. Good night. And obviously that would me that's you know, my biggest thing. I look at the reduction first and then like at the features on there. I'm seeing how you mesh well with the features and then you know, the lyrics come out through for me. So again, I enjoy it down man. I definitely do it. So I'm gonna give it a three. So that's our takes on it. Also Father for I I give it a 3 flight gives a two and a half. So there you go man as I'm review. Let's get to the song of the week. Now. I have to make two chains again because I don't know if you got a chance to listen to a rapper go to the league yet, but there was a particular song and let me not mess this up here give you the proper name of the song, but it had Ariana Grande on it. And it's only called rude earlier. Yeah, it's called rule the world and it had a Camry Camry sample here. I was like, whoa. I said I know this sucks. I said, what is this? I said oh, oh no, I feel like I told everybody on Twitter. I said are we gonna grind a doing uh doing a remix of why don't we fall in love and what I'm going home? He's like nah, he's I always felt that I was like, yo I said give it a chance man. Give it a chance. I'll legs actually a good song where you like. Nah, you like I'm good. But it just inspired me to like go back and listen to the Emery. So I want to we fall in love and when she came out. Oh man, I forgot like how hot she was fam. Like this song was fucking dope and shit. So I would have listened. I was like yo, this song was bumping yo, they beat was was dope as hell. So this is going to be my song for the week and that was inspiration from the from the sample remix for a router word vagina Grande en change to chase album. So Amory, why don't we fall in love? This came out in 2002 people 2002 to memory did take a long break, but she did apparently come back. I haven't even get channels in that album. Do I ain't even gonna lie, but but you did come back and start making music again, but when we first came out man, she had a bus. She definitely had a bus. So I respected that and this was definitely one of my favorite songs from her. Why don't we fall in love the find Marie Van de saint-fond is that stain? Wait find is that they I death he had a crush on her face that want that one thing video, bro.	1.0
But the joke there was that he is part of a group of people in Brazilian jiu-jitsu that it's just not what they do.

Oh, So that's sort of my ADC recap from a game theory perspective some of the big tournaments coming up between now and the end of the year think the big one is going to be the noogie worlds. And I think there's a couple in between that so I'm looking forward to kind of watching those and seeing what the trends are that we can learn from. There's a couple new studies that are in the pike at high percentage. I'm going to obviously keep doing the podcast if you want to check out my interviews with Tom to Blossom. Eddie Bravo, they're up on grappling Insider. You can just type in either my name or or one of their names into the search bar and we are starting to do a little bit more interviews as we get access to the athlete. So hopefully they'll be some exciting stuff coming up with that. I spent some time this week reorganizing the website because I felt like it was it was harder than it needed to be defined older articles. So what I did was I sort of read it all the categories and I think I have Some basic categories right now, which is Game Theory articles stats and research articles and podcasts articles and then all the articles I kind of like tag with their keywords. So if you are just looking for an article that you're not sure exists just try typing in the search bar should be a little bit easier to find than and spin the past. Yeah, that's just been a long-term thing that's been bugging me and I'm going to keep trying to make the website better. And of course make the podcast better. Thanks everyone for Or listening. I'll see you next week. Have a great week of training.	1.0

But specifically for like that episode there was talk about how Dylan was confused as to why it was going in the direction that it was going so suddenly and made absolutely no sense and because Like there was well there was talk about the how there was supposed to be steric and how it there was going to be a build-up to steric. It was actually going to happen and that there was like plans and there was agreement and contracts between certain actors to like build it up whatever and that it just all shifted randomly for no reason, which I still don't know about it still don't know the information.

It was easy to maintain and it reinforced the type of play. I wanted when someone would make a great play. There would usually be one or two girls yelling heart sticker. It was perfect fast forward to The Following season a few of the same girls are on my team and I'm excited to use stickers as bribery for good play yet again. I announce this to the team at our first meeting expecting the same excitement and enthusiasm which existed with my previous team. However, this group of girls was older and quite frankly not even mildly enthused about stickers Gotta Love high schoolers. I was a little taken aback. By their sideways glances and raised eyebrows, but just knew that once we started playing and they started earning their stickers. They would love it. This was never the case try as I might the stickers never stuck. I tried and tried but it eventually proved to be more of a distraction than a source of unity halfway through the season. I admitted defeat and ditched the stickers. If anything that experience taught me that I cannot force traditions on to a team, especially when they develop organically from a teammate. Up of completely different individuals. So when you are trying to create reinforcements of your preferred behaviors just be aware that some may not work as you planned and be okay with abandoning your efforts when you're positive. They won't catch on or work for your team. Try things out that worked for you when you played But realize that your team might not be as excited as you are just because something doesn't catch on initially doesn't mean it won't work. I enjoy mixing up teams and warm up Partners, but telling the girls to pick a new partner literally never works. And someone is always complaining it's horrible.

Um, it was probably I feel like the one that was angry was when I was like livid at the show, which was after the still Leah episode and I can house When doused Eric wasn't going to happen and all of this craziness was happening was there is what was it called? Um, so it was the collective that Teen Wolf People we're going to create like their own Tumblr called the collective and they were going to upload like you could upload pictures of fan art and whatever and it was so obvious like they were only going to include hetero Actual fan art like they weren't going to allow / shipping and it was just a way for them to like control their fandom like the Teen Wolf and um, and I got a message from somebody who like I can't reveal who they are, but they worked with like this system. It was like listen you have influence amongst the Teen Wolf and mm based on like how popular you are and you have a voice if you speak out. Out against this it will like stop the Teen Wolf people from trying to do whatever it is that they're doing and so they were like you can write a post and just like tell the fandom don't you know mess with this Collective crab don't you know join this? Yes, just you know a way for them to control the fandom and then I like I've looked at like their terms of service or whatever and it was like if you upload a piece of fan art, they You can complete control of that own it own it to like do whatever it is that they want to do with it. So I just formulated this giant post and then I think I uploaded like I posted it before the collective even dropped. So like it was before like it got announced that it was gonna be like into like for like usage. So I uploaded it and people just went crazy over it saying I'm not using this. This is crap blah blah blah and then the piece ER guy who worked at the time for the Teen Wolf PR like ranted on it and like sub tweeted me and he said he said something like like I hate when people who don't know what they're talking about come in and ruin something that you've been working on for like months and I'm like, well, sorry, we all know who that guy was and he still trash to this day.	0.0

Yeah, I think so and I think that's where what like your strong suit is like like you get story like you have all sorts of great ideas and where your story sounds really comes out is in Your visuals like I you know when I give you a signal we're going to shoot and I have the storyboard and I'm like, I think it's going to look something like this like you're interested like okay, where are these characters heads out where they're doing and you shape your lighting and angles and stuff kind of around that like whatever. I might not have already thought about that's where you jump in. You're like, I want to have, you know a dark back here because you know Duality or whatever, you know, and like that's that's a, you know, a huge part of the storytelling as well as well as the place where you Excel that I do pretty much nothing with is, you know, Partnerships with Brands stuff like that you're able to I mean, it's at the moment. We're still working on our funding but at the moment, it seems like the majority of its going to come from you being able to talk to these Brands they like hey, here's how making this movie can help you guys out and exchange for you to give a little bit of money to actually make it. Yeah and like so far it's looking like we're gonna get a bit of money out of that and that's something that I would not be able to like, that's not I'm not I don't really create content for Brands other than it might like my day job, but I don't sell that content to help make it.	1.0

I definitely want to let you know that just because this is, you know, a quote-unquote vegan podcast. It doesn't mean that I'm going to sit here and tell you all the benefits of being vegan and all the reasons why you should do it too and all the reasons why you should raise your kids vegan. I am not about That I'm not about telling anybody what to do. I think that my podcast is going to be here more to educate you on my life not necessarily to have you sway one way or the other that's that's your choice a hundred percent your choice and your kids are going to be raised the way that you wanted raise them. You know, I'm definitely not here to tell you to do it one way or the other or my way is Better no. No. No, you know you guys make your decisions and just listen to to the podcast and make your decisions off of your own research. Definitely don't don't feel the need to to do something or live the lifestyle just because you're listening to the podcast. There's a zero judgment zero judgment Zone moving on to the other kind of mom that I am I am. I am in the process of becoming a surrogate mom that is exciting news. That's kind of a little mini bomb that I wanted to drop on you guys. So I want to shine some light into that area of my life. We are in the beginning stages. I wouldn't say the early stages. That was a long time ago. That was like back in November. That's early stages. So I've been in this process for quite some time quite a few months. So it is I'm not I am now ready. It is time for me to reveal this news to you and part of the reason why I wanted to do that and why I wanted to include my surrogacy process in this podcast is because of the feedback that I've gotten by family members and non family members. So I I wanted to shine some light into that part of my life to help people make the correct decisions and to help people understand what it's like to be on my side. I know that people see a lot of advertisement about making x amount of money to help and what not and I basically want to give you my side of the story and why I'm doing it. So one of the next episodes will be about That specifically just surrogacy so stay tuned stay tuned for more on that process and the fourth type of mother that I am I like to say that I'm a mother F. ER so side note. I don't cuss that much when I do it's very rare, but I won't say I don't do it. I do do it sometimes but if I can avoid it I will So I am a mom of multiples. I'm a bonus Mom. I'm becoming a surrogate mom and I'm a mother F ER. So I am the mother of all mothers or at least I'm calling myself one.	1.0
Maybe you need a toy box in the corner. Because there are always toy spread out or maybe you need an ottoman that opens up or a coffee table that has a drawer some way to put things away.	1.0
Totally. Yeah, and so what happens and it's interesting that you know, you all speak so much about like deprivation and I'm curious to hear the connection. But like when you when you go through that process of whether it's fasting or just restricting your calories in some way even if you don't think you're restricting your calories, but to your body like your body doesn't actually know if that's intentional that you're on a diet or you're trying out some new fasting Trend or if you're literally like experiencing food insecurity or a famine. So on the weekend as soon as you are around abundance with Food or as soon as you like loosen the reins on the tight grip of your eating habits, your body is also kicking up your Cravings your hunger hormones your metabolism to try to compensate for that missed caloric energy that you missed out on. So again, it's like it's not even Something That We're consciously doing but as soon as your body believes that you're that you have access to food again, it will send you into overdrive to try to make up for that loss.	0.0
Yeah, it's just a few more houses with a few more areas for loot spawn. I spend sometimes Bridges could be a hit or a Miss. Like you could find a bunch of Shield cells or maybe and a couple of mozambique's and bridges and then other times maybe all you'll run out with decent load out.	1.0

Now, sometimes I'm using a cleaning wipe and I'll just go ahead and use that in the sink as well and I'll wipe that out after wiping down the counter top. I'll throw that wipe away with a couple fresh wipes. I'll wipe the toilet seat. I'll lift it all white behind the seat. Then I'll wipe the rim everything that involves the area behind the hinges between the hinges all that throw those away and then I'll get a fresh wipe or wipes plural to wipe the flusher handle and then the back of the tank which can be kind of Dusty.	1.0

Yeah working. Yeah, you can't do anything on your own terms. You gotta keep working keep turning down music. She's crazy. She's crazy. But let's get off of that. Let's get on some positive news J. Cole says that he wants revenge of the dreamers 3 to come out in April. They're still working on it again that whole like 10-day process which is Louis to get all of the vocals done. I presume the vocals in the production, but obviously takes a long time to make sure to get all the samples clear that they have mix and master everything. So again, it's a process. I know that you know as Fans of dreamville. I wanted you know the stuff to come out a little bit earlier when they first announced it but under their realistically I wasn't going to happen. I was trying to say like the end of February but obviously going to take a longer time in that but he was just talking to some fans the other day and he did not like directly confirm that it's going to come out in April what this is just what he is hoping that the album will come off revenge of the dreamers. Meanwhile, we've been trying to make sure they and the dreamers 3 is done and then put it on video. So the middle child videos now and of course he was at all-star weekend. He performed and participated in the in the dunk contest as well helping out not some people so it's cool man, but I'll open it. It does come out in April like he like he wanted to hopefully we don't as music fans have to wait too much longer because I already know this is gonna be some heat from the previews that we've been hearing and I know Jay ID, for example that man has been on tour going to places and The like previewing some stuff as well. So what are you expecting from this from this compilation album when it comes out flood fire.	1.0
So yeah, so if either one of them photo 44, I think that that's a great fit as well. I'm not a big fan of McCoy here. I just think that it's not necessarily what I'm looking for. He's a good player. I just not I'm not running to the podium for him personally, but I think Really considering guys like Deonte Thompson lawn Thornhill all three receivers that you mentioned Hollywood Brown Depot Samuel and the other one there with wires Campbell yet. No. No the good news Calvin Harmon.	0.0
He was like 306 for the first K and then just over free 10 for the second K. Yeah, and then the last one I thought over 324 last time.	1.0
I'm probably like a season or two. Yeah, I agree. They've been very separated more just like surface-level friends because maybe they happen friends for so long.	1.0
And take that as broad or as narrow as you'd like, I think I think I spoke about it before was just educating people. I did find that quite a struggle at the beginning trying to even get in front of real estate agents and convince them that home staging was a benefit to them and it would help them sell properties faster. So that that's probably been my biggest hurdle and it's Still ongoing today.	0.0
So they're still really clean and I'm going to try to keep them clean, but I'm sure the day will come when I'm covering them in foil again in preparation for my mom to come visit her something. So, you know once they get discolored so yeah the stovetop though just around the burners you're wiping that every day and then the back control panel area. But on most days you're also going to want to wipe the front of your larger appliances, you know with some kind of a spray and a paper towel or maybe your microfiber cloth whatever you use is it's not important what you use but you'll want to wipe the front of your dishwasher your oven the outside of your refrigerator. Shredder just get rid of those fingerprints and whatnot front of your microwave and then a bonus chore if you have time and this is a day that you would go deeper would be to clean the inside of your microwave a lot of times when I'm hand washing dishes.	1.0
So we knew three days before. So again, we come in like we're setting up for the meet and greet Bashas like iron shirt were obviously turning on the office and funny enough. It was on live TV, so that was great. So watching the office and I'm like crap, you know, I have to go to this meet and greet right now, and I just really To finish this episode. It was like so good. I think it's the one when Jim proposes to Pam or something like that and I'm like, oh my God, this is the best like so good. Just want to watch it and we're like, okay, whatever. We'll just we'll go on Netflix later and like finish watching the episode. I'm like, okay, so we go to the meet and greet. And Sasha Farber turned around to me and he's like, oh my God Meredith is here. I'm like, what? Wait, who's Meredith? Yeah. Wait. What do you mean? He's like Danny Meredith is here. I'm like, what are you talking about? I turn around and she's standing right behind me and I'm like, you're in my living room.	1.0
You don't know he did the whole dance. He jumped onto Patrick Swayze's arms. He was having the time. Okay, Caitlin. Riordan says she hates shots hit her daughter has a condition that requires a shot every night. Oh, oh no and a different shot one time a week. So Mom a very has Ms. And one of the the medication she was on required a shot like three times a week and you have to rotate where you take it on your body or else it gets like a yeah, like scar and bring yeah, and I had to do the shot a lot of the times fucking nightmares. It was worse. Me than it was for obviously. It wasn't but like being the person who's not a Doctor Who's like I is the whole little there's a whole little shop machine is a machine that shoots in in but like every time like she like flipped like a diabetes one where you like it goes pound. It just says it's sort of like a sort of yeah sure exact probably exactly like that.	0.0
Yeah, and those just talked about those real quick to those are four milligrams generally and the reason being for that is, you know, it's a One-Shot dose and the in the Nares and the way it's absorbed and you can lose so much out of that nostril as well not just on placement and everything. So that's why it's a Larger dose for that because people always worry about what's going to be too much of a loading dose. What if they come up out of withdrawals or or not, but it's there's so many aspects to that of how well it gets placed to when you administer it to how much runs out the absorption rate the work. So right.	0.0
Yep. We met in San Francisco and dated there for about three years before moving to Florida. Not together separately separately.	1.0
It's like your TV opened up and she stepped into the living room the craziest thing this far to be honest.	1.0
Yeah, so, okay. Basically we had a meet and greet for the Dancing with the Stars cast and we didn't know who was going to be on it. We had no idea what kind of celebrities wanted to do the season, so we're kind of just we also got the call that We're going to be on dancing stars three days before Good Morning America.	1.0
And I'm just curious Casey like when you went off the Whole 30 what happened in your relationship with those foods that were then off-limits.	1.0
Well, yeah, I've seen better looks from Trinity. Yeah. Absolutely. It's a decent. Look, it's not my favorite. Yeah. Next is Naomi and this is my least favorite. Yeah, cause she already did this. I hate dating Royals already. She's worn this outfit like a thousand times where it's like some she wants these innate it was the Combs with her hair is like a re-creation of this don't like it.	0.0
Yeah, they make sense for the Angels. Love that pairing makes as much sense for the Indians. I think the Angels would probably have to overpay just based on. Their system. It's such a weird. It's a weird thing anyway, because as we've talked about so many times like Obviously kluber does not have Peak trade value right now, you know, you're better off waiting six months or taking a time machine to go back a year or a year and a half. So you're asking a team to take on the contract and I know we've said like the contract is fine. As long as he turns out to be even an adequate picture but no one knows what he's going to be and so it's like you somehow still have to convince a team to give you a really useful piece. Otherwise, it makes more sense to just hold them. And the angels are weird team because they're so top-heavy and their farm system is a lot better than it was a few years ago. When it looks like Mike Trout was just gonna waste away like Tom Hanks in Castaway with Albert Pujols as Wilson, but it's I just made a movie reference like we hate document this podcast, but I think my name is void dumbass. That's that's a good reference. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what they eventually do with him because Because I think it's it's difficult to find if you're going to trade him. Now, then you some team is has to get desperate and I almost think the opposite of the Clevenger thing think of me more sense if the Dodgers liked kluber and believed in him just param with Linda or and see if that'll make a difference.	1.0
It's going great.	1.0
Love to You hear? Yeah, looks like I finally get to hang out with you. Yeah, when I lived together in Austin, it was perfect. I actually lived with Yell sister Talia in University of Maryland in college. And then I was moving to Austin after to follow a boyfriend. I didn't end up with and old days, right? Yeah all days good times. Yeah, and talia's like my sister's moving their you should totally live with her and I thought I was going to be living with this sorority chick and she was not let me tell. Tell you she is like an earthy vegan if I accidentally didn't recycle something you would think the world was going to end and she was like catch me eating like Twizzlers and stuff and be likely I why you have a healthy alternative. Let me cook you up some I don't even know what she would make. I mean these smoothie Bowl she'd make in the morning, but I got access to all of this because I was living with her. I mean it was the coolest year of my life.	1.0
The truth to delay going inwards as long as possible really like to try and take in with my surroundings and that's the beauty of travel by me, you know, like focus on again the nice scenery or like a big beautiful Trend that we've seen or all the other Runners, you know? Yeah, I guess inevitably you end up, you know thinking going inside your own brain and then maybe mm. Yeah, I guess that all comes with experience that the more you do it the easier.	1.0
Well, you live out here. I was like, yeah, I kind of like both. Okay. Alright, you like a loli. But anyway, thank you. Good luck with everything Omar's getting out of here, but I'm still sticking around one more segment to go. Y'all know what's coming people fucking I'm bothered. When I was in high school, my mother told me she had one goal for me to make sure I made it out of high school without getting pregnant. Now. My mother had me when she was 18 years old. So she was coming from a perspective of having truly been there and done that. I like a lot of other young women. I got the usual speech about sex keep your legs closed, but she also put me on birth control pills when I Fifteen or sixteen years old. She taught me how to properly put on a condom. She talked to me very openly about sex point. Is she army with the information she felt like I needed in order to make informed decisions about my own body. Now young people in sex is always going to be a polarizing emotional topic. And so I understand why everybody lost their shit when TI who was one of my first podcast guest said during a podcast interview recently that he went to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. And when she was in high school to quote check her hymen, in other words to ensure she was still a virgin the backlash was immediate Swift severe and intense but T. I also received a lot of support from both men and women for what he said now before diving into the reaction a few things need to be cleared up in the aftermath TI and Tiny who appeared on red table talk, which is hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith and her mother they told their side of the story T. I explained that he was joking. King and embellishing he did not go to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. He explained he did accompany his daughter and Tiny to the gynecologist once and it was mostly happenstance. He said he has never been in the examination room with his daughter and when he was at the gynecologist, she welcomed his presence but here's an excerpt from that conversation on red table talk.	1.0
that	1.0
Absolutely. So we're going to get. After Sterling leaves the room the investors debrief. He was awesome. He was so hard to say you only anything but yes to I mean I can see I can find people for his company right now. I know great salesperson for his company. I think you're also getting in at a good like a potentially a great price. Right? If this guy you couldn't profitability or the structure rounds think that's mocked up, you know, once he hits 20 customers, he's gonna do this. Okay he's going to do there is no stopping this guy you can tell and every time we threw something over the bow is Shot over the bow. He would shoot right back in a very very low respectful way. Sorry, man. But yeah exactly. I have to you think he'll meet I'm hoping he meets with your team. He's going to meet with them today.	1.0

So this is an interesting take because launders has no experience with Star Wars and some would even say he's like dumb as hell just get me. And me and intellectual know that it's true. I'm super into Star Wars. I'm very curious about your take for someone who doesn't who's not like a complete nerd.	1.0

Yeah. I mean you look at by the time I was in Middle School. I got to a point where I was like, oh like this shows annoying like shake it up as annoying ant farms enjoying the actress has really shaken up and former both terrible shows, which will probably get interviews about those but like I'm just I'm straight talking about like the main characters that actresses like I would always be like, oh like they're so annoying. I never thought Miley Cyrus was annoying and like watching this I was Like I understand like what she is someone. Yeah, which I think is also just like part of being able to like look at something when you're older and being because wouldn't even say our ages. We're like both 20 now. So when this show came out was show came out in 2005. Yeah, or yeah, it was definite. I was we were young	0.0
That's just like they're naturally thin but we can't wrap our Mind around the fact that some people the same way are not exactly have a larger body and it's not anything to do they could be a much healthier eater and they might have a way more, you know, regular exercise routine and it just doesn't it doesn't mean that their body will change but you can't look at somebody and know what their health status is you can't tell what they're like metabolic markers of Health are or how off you know, how strong they are. We just can't tell.	1.0
Well one person has we've been kept on talking about your Blossom one person who does not respond well to you know challenges we're being told no right our good old pal Shiro Blossom share old good old Cheryl and she wants to throw a back to school dance.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean first off like what were your what were your impressions obviously, you know ours.	1.0
I've noticed that because we've had a lot of the World of Dance contestants here in this studio and making it different parts of the competition whether we've had winners and we've had people that made it halfway or people that you know, made it even just around and it's been interesting because they said everyone has Said the exposure is unbelievable.

There are some actors that you feel like you personally know because they play roles that remind you of folks in your family and your neighborhood or people you went to school with. So in 1999 the movie The Wood came out and it really is one of the most underrated movies because what made that movie special. Is while it was based in Inglewood those characters could have been coming of age and Detroit Chicago really anywhere now Omar Epps my guest today on Jamel Hills and I'm bothered has been in a few movies that are just like that from Jews to Love & Basketball, even the program he has had an incredible career that has spanned some years. He joins me today to discuss not just his career, but the book he wrote about black fatherhood his days as a former MC in case y'all didn't know he used to spend on the mic and Why we've never seen him and Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin in the same room now, but all jokes aside. Very pleased to welcome Omar Epps. He's up next. Because I'm such a gracious host especially to guess whose work. I've admired for a while and you know people who I get the sense even though Omar you and I don't know each other that well, but you know, I fuck with you, right? So because of that, of course, I'm gonna open with something that I'm sure you have a lot of thoughts and opinions that plays right to your strength. Let's talk about your damn Cowboys. Ha ha ha. Wow. I know what a what an opener. Yeah, like real Graces of me to like bring up something. I'm sure right now for Cowboys versus everybody is a sore subject. So where do you stand on Jason Garrett? Because a lot of is to some degree typical after a loss that people immediately direct all their anger and frustration at the coach. So that's kind of common but with Jason Garrett is just has always felt as if there's been this love-hate relationship between him and Cowboys fans who are expecting more you always expect more but in particular this year, so what's your assessment of?	1.0
About 20 of those. Yeah, I like witty Aura. So I've already shot from everywhere. He's classes. So I picked call him right because I actually thought was very underrated.

So this has Sterling would say he is the honey when a customer uses a Retailer's app. Sandbox Commerce is able to collect data about those customers for the retailer. The assumption is of course that this will help them better Market to these customers Amazon for example has an insane amount of data on people's buying habits and they use it to sell more stuff. But if you're a retailer that sells on Amazon you don't get access to that info Amazon Hogs that sweet sweet data for themselves now you Sandbox, Commerce retailers will have their own little stockpile of data.

The voice of the skull crawler is very high in tone. It's possessing a raspy quality of the hiss and growl mixed in between according to supervisor sound a sound designer and editor Al Nelson. The skull crawlers voice was inspired by the painful bye-bye the painful squeal of a Dying rabbit. And also the and sounds of sea lions and squirrels are mixed together.

It's fucking nuts. It's so good. Cause all the cutscenes and the camera the camera eat like the action camera like one of the most underrated aspects like in Smash Bros. Melee, but they made a lot of clones one thing that was brought up. That was like this really kind of salient point from one of my viewers was just that it's the camera secretly that makes the game so much fun. Like it's not it's like it feels like someone's holding it and following you around and that like kind of like that feeling that it's like more lives at helped so much the camera and this game is so good when they switch from cutscenes to like when you're in different environments if it's like rumbly or whatever. It's such a good camera. So smooth always where you need it to be it's never annoying to deal with with and even though there's like a vertical layers to the map. You don't have to like look you don't like look up too hard. Yeah someone it's so it's so well done. It feels like the whole thing feels extremely linear, but then there's so much to explore so I it's just like got everything so far. Yeah.

I always used to say when I started doing drag I felt like every time I would go to drag shows before I see drag drag queens would do something and pull out a dildo and I remember starting to do dragon go I will do drag but I'm never bringing a dildo on stage like it was just like I was so tired of seeing it and again, I'm not saying, you know, you just brought up one person who did something similar to that. We've seen stuff like this before it's not new and creative had it been new and creative and fit the song. I would be all for it a hundred percent behind it. It just didn't make sense with the song. I just felt like she was reaching in trying to win the challenge which is the point you're trying to win the challenge. She reached into her bag of tricks and said I'm going to try this and see if it works and it well. I think that Trinity was giving her season 9 like reference but she was doing the Charlie hides.

I finished time and I and I had a client say Only once during the speed session and she'll quite often doesn't want to train with a watch on at all and not even know you're like your $10 digital watches you guys. She said she wishes it there was a watch it didn't measure your time, but measured your your enjoyment like so, you know, especially, you know, if only we had a way of measuring like other metrics for our run and so it'll be good. You know, you get to a point and your little watch says that you're enjoying yourself, you know, like do Native watch for that but because I didn't I get so I do I keep saying on on getting time goals the truck certain training sessions and and making sure I was getting heart rate goals and you know, all that stuff. And yes. Yeah, so I think you would probably you seem like the kind of person who would like to buy a watch. It measures your enjoyment and not your time.	1.0
Maybe having a coffee station in your formal dining room. But at this house are Keurig is in the kitchen and then I guess the coffee station mentality is still there because I have a little sign about coffee and I keep some bugs and teas and sugar right above the Keurig.

Devon Bush middle linebacker from Michigan Josh Jacobs running back from Alabama Christian Wilkins from Clemson Cody Ford Guard from Oklahoma and then Jonah Williams and then greedy Williams right behind them. So there's your top prospects on the board right now according the simulation in round. One and I like the idea of Jonah Williams. I do Wonder like you said it might be a luxury you kind of want a guy who's going to come in right away and play a little bit more do use your top one at 12.

So I guess there is a good part to the story. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm just looking at my notes and I had a couple different stories and I just looked at this and there was a time where I fell asleep in one of my best friend's driveways in high school. But other than that that was a whole other story, but we're not going to get into that. But yeah, so I'm like crying to this cop and they like clearly tell that I am struggling and so as I know from this point is that I have a drinking ticket and when you go to drinking ticket, I think you need to Like 30 days until they call you because you need to like go to these classes so you can like you like path I be in a yes at 16 years old. No, but listen to what happened, I actually got pretty lucky. So they're supposed to call within 30 days. And if they don't call you, then you're like off the hook. They like forget about you. So that's what happens me. But if they did call me I would have had to do all these classes. I would have had to pay like a huge fine, but they never called me. Oh my god. So let's assume I'm fine. There's bigger and better things to conquer. I know I think I like Even Lee was like people doing heroin. Oh, yeah, and I was just like drunk off of two bears at 16. Like I was fine. Yeah. I feel like in high school like drunkenness was very different than drunkenness in college. Like I got hammered and lost my toenail and didn't remember. Yeah, but for me a school without it happen, I would have seemed very much remembered. Yo, I don't know my high school was pretty like it's funny because I got into a relationship with Cody the my freshman year of College so like I'm not trying to saying this like lame in college because I wasn't like I still want out and shit but in high school like I think like I don't know our fucking high school was pretty wild like I had some of my wildest times in high school, but also in college, so I think it's like pretty definitely I would say training College. Yeah. No, I think I hit it early in high school for sure, but I do think like equally I've had just this crazy times in college then I didn't High School. I had to get my eggs for me in high school was like a thing thing. Like I was smoked I was so against weed for the long. I don't think I had like my first oh my God, my first so bad like blonde or whatever J anything until Earth smoked out of a bowl. So I was in like 11th grade I used to but I got drunk guy in like seventh grade. So I used to go to my car on my lunch break when I was in high school and literally roll a joint and walk in.

And this is like in the, you know, pretty early days of the internet and IMDb had just come out and so it used to be so okay, even before that. I would go to this video store and they had like a big like movie catalog or not catalog but like an encyclopedia and so like, you know, the first person I went looked up with James Cameron because he's who wrote directed Terminator 2 and so I could find out like it wasn't as easy back then to find out who You know what filmmaker like what movies he done like a complete like, you know filmography, but then, you know IMDb came out and and suddenly I was able to like search for this stuff. It was all just like text back then right? I was about to say IMDb wasn't out yet. You nailed it? Yeah. Yeah. That's our reference. Now. That's that is our dictionaries.

Yeah, there was somebody on on the interweb. I think I want to say was just a couple of days after it came out. They put out one of those like concept Arts of of Titanfall pilot. And so I want to say like the passive was the passive was double jump. I think they're know the passive was the passive was wall running. I think oh gosh. we'll jump was in there somewhere and then I can't remember what the can't remember the Oldham it is and I'm like, you know, I think that could be the only way that like a straight-up pilot could make its way into it is that if the clinic call in the Titan and then that kind of defeats the purpose of it, but to have a character who could like double jump or whatever that yeah, that could kind of be like a grappling hook or a jump pad in a sense that you know, hey, I'm just going to double jump and as long as that was like his passive and it wasn't like Then you had to like recharge on I don't know that could be kind of cool. I mean, I feel like they're definitely need I feel like they're definitely needs to be like maybe a stamina bar on it so that you could have just double don't double jump double double double double double.	1.0
The next coming up - bye. Mrs. Shaw because 64 tick no honestly. No, I don't either. I don't think I like a lot of the stuff.

There's also doors open faster on 64, so I didn't know that aids are all throw differently than be hopping is not worse or better. It's just different right? Yeah. So there's like a lots of things out. Ali really like about 164 tick and when it comes to the shooting, I mean it feels different but not like objectively worse.	0.0

Around this path, which goes past the nice little like and they do it for six days. And it was just and it got quite warm we had the first couple days was windy and cold and then I got quite hot and we had I think the winning distance in the end was a local guy named Darren Darren Lenny who did 835 kilometers in six days and handling.

Yeah, you're right. We're starting to give the territory where you get to groupthink with these pics, but A reason why the no offense selection specifically to Green Bay is such a popular one. He fits indeed. It's a good fit for the offense on top of that just like every other player. We're going to pick today. He fits what Green Bay is looking for at the position. He meets their thresholds easily. So I think that Noah fan is an easy selection here, but I'm curious who else is on the board. I may be you said it I just missed it, but I didn't hear Drew lock either.	1.0
How about socks? Oh my God. Fuck.	0.0

Yeah. Yeah the wall running. I feel like I don't think is there were there are certain parts that I've noticed. It's like okay, here's this pipe for instance and it has this flat surface on the side of it now granted you couldn't mantle that but it's like it how long it is unlike this kind of seems like they have real running in it and they just they took it out because exact there's some parts on the map where I'm like that that is clearly a wall running wall, but for some reason it's here and it's just taken out or something. I would like it limited time event. I'll be honest. I'd like it limited time. We're like while running and All jumping we're just you know, everybody had it. You know, I feel like that would be really cool. And I mean maybe even maybe even for solos, you know, if we get solos because the main reason at least this is from the developers themselves the main reason they took it out was because it encourages people to split up but if we're doing solos we don't have to worry about splitting up it would be kind of cool to wall run.	1.0
You might have fancy canisters lined up in a row and they're all labeled.	1.0
I'll sometimes volunteer something to and then know that it's an invitation to ask how I'm doing and it's so basic and it's so pedestrian but you know, it's not going to be a new / that we increasingly don't talk to each other and interact in like ways to like really share data and really share truth and you know for me for a long time what helped is	1.0

I've been to I never get done you've been there. For six hours, but time you get there a little bit early and you watch and they have the Indian relay. They have the Indian relay races and I mean it in a policy say the way when I say your be there for six hours. I mean, it's six hours of fun. But time you go to The Letter Buck room and you go to the when you go to the rodeo starts and they have like I said the Indian relay races The Wild Cow Milking and they Buck, you know, 20 whore 20 bare backs 20 Bronx a bunch of bulls have did they have you know, there's just a whole bunch of Stuff and and and it's awesome. It's just so I guess what a person has to really be cognitive of is that it's not always about this. Like it's there rodeos aren't just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter everybody and every Rodeo has a different, you know different way of marketing their deal and that's what I think is pretty really pretty cool about the West Coast rodeos in particular. Is that whether you're at Salinas with the bullfights and what's going on and the California rodale and then you go to the Pendleton with the with the Native American You know history involved in the Tepee Village and all that all all even over to Joseph Organ, you know where that you know Chief Joseph days. I really felt celebrate the best Perce tribe and all that's going on. It's just a lot a lot of different things that play into how they Market their rodeos and how they do their thing is and each each one's different a little bit but really kind of there's a lot a lot to to see in a lot to check out. It's really cool. I think. So, like I said, it's not there not just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter there. It's there's just each one's a little bit different and I like it.	1.0

So if you have clutter get that dealt with so that you can kind of isolate the mess down to just dishes if you have dishes to do You're going to want to put away clean dishes. Maybe you have a drying rack that you need to empty, or maybe you need to empty your dishwasher. And put those things away and if you don't have any dishes to do, you know while I'm talking about dishes just get right into the deep cleaning of your kitchen because some days if you've been, you know cleaning as you go doing dishes after meals, you might not have a messy kitchen. So if that's you this would be a great day to just deep clean your surfaces like, you know, maybe even the inside of your microwave the inside of your fridge.	0.0

So I like to use a bar of soap in the bathroom that I can. So use on my face and then of course your guests want the soap to come from a pump. So in the kids bathroom / guest bathroom, you know, it's a hand soap pump and sometimes there's also a bar there if you know one of the kids wash their face in the sink, but for the most part they do that in the shower. So I tend to wash my face in the sink on some mornings. So I like to have that there and my husband doesn't seem to mind using a bar of soap in his sink either and I feel like it's a little bit cheaper. So when I mentioned soap dishes that's more in the master bathroom, or maybe it's for someone in your hall bathroom to wash their face with but I do recommend having a pump for guests to wash their hands with when they use the restroom.	1.0
You know, it's just nice. That's like a really kind of like that's like a kind of very cordial handshake right where it is. Yeah. Everyone was just trying to have fun. That's what that is the point of the game, you know, when people I do like when people are like they know sometimes it goes too far with like I ice beside ins streams and stuff like that, but when people are like, oh it's content its content like everybody is so aware. Yeah what that is almost sickening but like at least it's better than people not being aware and buying into Something that they don't understand it's kind of cool that if you'd like people are I remember like when he's first started it like watching YouTube your favorite YouTubers couldn't have a fucking sponsor without everyone calling them fucking sellouts or Yeah by trying to dissuade them. Tell them they're unsubscribe and shit like that. And now people understand the plights of the guys were probably make it like millions of dollars more than like their parents do they'll be like no he's just got to do this right? He's just this is important. How is he going to make a living if he doesn't take on a Sir, we have to be supportive like all that stuff. That's the kind of rhetoric.

It's just extra content free cases and stuff like that. Then they added skins for the models in your game. So they added all like different like kind of better looking models to the game. And even though the game's first person they So added a screen at the end that gives you accolades for different things that you did best during the game. So if you had like a highest ATR most headshots or whatever you'll all be on display for your team to see and then they will show you liked what you were actually best at so like utility damage or Flash assists or ADR and then you get there.

Like I don't know what his sources are but like he was actually talking about the fact that it was going to be a battle or who's going to be a battle royale that it wasn't going to be in the TitanFall Universe. I don't think he said anything about classes. So there was a few things that he got wrong, but that was actually the first time I ever heard of it and I'm like Well, that's kind of cool. I mean, I like a lot of people, you know, love Titanfall 2 and it came out and yeah, it was very much. It was very much the same thing you were saying just like well dang it, you know every they were put to they were put to death by EA and so for for it to kind of turn around into this was probably one of the most amazing things. I mean the little a lot of people kind of already talked about it, but it's just the fact that is like hey, you know this game that we made well, it's already And it's like wait. What?	1.0

Yes. Absolutely. I agree with you. It's kind of like a Hot Topic right now that a lot of people might hear and not know specifically what it is. So to break it down intuitive eating is a nonlinear approach to health and food and your overall well-being where the fundamental belief is that you are the expert of your own body. And so The traditional Health realm where we're constantly told to look outside of ourselves at the latest, you know Health Trends and gurus and food rules. What's good for you? What's bad for you intuitive eating asks that you actually just tune into the unique messages your body sends you and determine what is best for your health based on what you feel in your own body. So it's going to be different for every single person and again because you are the expert of your own body. Nobody can decide better than you what you really need. It's also a system that really helps restore a more empowered enjoyable and peaceful relationship with food and your body as opposed to having you work against and fight your body all the time and guys.	1.0

We went in and we bought this home where shop and it actually is a real blessing in disguise for right at home staging because I can access A lot of products through the shop and also they kind of a good advertising for either side of the business.

He is the Beast somebody and I think that that's why because ultimately I think one of the reasons especially what what do we want to call them Timmy Mick em. He I think one of the reasons he was petty is because we didn't see Whatever. He was told the big picture was he couldn't show us the big picture and so all he saw was us being very upset and rightfully, so but instead of being like Oh, no, you're rightfully upset is just like will screw it. You know, you guys don't know what you're talking about and it's like yeah, we don't know and that's the problem is that we're reacting to this nonsense that you guys are throwing at us. I remember when we interviewed Chantal love her love her love her, but we are you know, Did you ever talk about steric onset? And she was like no, nope. Nope, never know and it was just like and then we asked her like who do you ship and she's like, oh, yes, Derek and never talked about it. All right, never ever ever never on set. You know, and I was like, I don't they're still a timeline of leadership that I'm very interested in it and that show because I was I was contacted which was interesting. Maybe because it was late. It was like 2015 but it was by a lawyer who used to work on the show. And so, you know just got some general Dietz that way because you know, he didn't have anything new of course, but the idea that yeah, there were these malls and you could see it sometimes in the writing but the problem was in trying to help us they ended up mucking up the cannon and mucking up the it even more because it's like I would kind of rather just have it Crash and Burn and just be mad at it than having these little things pop up or like oh wait, is that something and it's not them it wasn't them trying to give us hope but it was more like we see you.	0.0
Well then just think about remember at sdcc where they had that thing where they were reading the fan fiction. And in fact, that's kind of how we originally got involved with Edie and we were actually on her side because she was like that was disgraceful like they had him reading this big but it was purely to make fun of it and purely the laugh at the author was fine, but it was like still that's not a good look. Yeah. Yeah and And then that on top of Jeff's whole thing that Linden let slip where Jeff was like, you know, they told us no, in fact, I think Hoechlin even said it in an interview in Dillon to maybe we've been like don't look at any of the fan art don't look at any of the fanfic. I'll do that. I'll take care of that for you. I'll respond to that for you.

Yeah. Nothing lasts indefinitely. Yeah. It's certainly not something for the next three of five years and I don't think it's something that we could and should expect within the next 10 years or something. But I could be wrong. I mean one thing that creates me because the whole doll system creates problems of its own and the problems themselves might get out of that. It's not sufficient that the current crop of politicians and central banks and so on that they are knowledgeable and that they are relatively discipline. So they don't exaggerate the practice of helping themselves with the printing press because there are other problems that are resulting from the current monetary system that we have. The most important ones being that is the lack of responsibility of the dear responsible ization and of the of the financial markets on the one hand and the the consumption of capital on the other hand. Okay. Let me be the first one is probably this needed that I explain this to you and to your audience because you're probably aware of this right that simply if you know that you have some something like a backstop that comes Through the printing press Yahoo! Central Bank behind you or the Central Bank the sues the mission of stabilizing the financial Market well, and it does so with the printing press then this amounts to a socialization of a part of your risk. So as a consequence risk taking as rule is always on. All right, so you get very from oil you valuation of shares and other asset classes and so on and you get equally enthusiastic use of Leverage. I had to do to get the results that you need at least in the short time. I saw the economy is moving on a on a did path. Right and this makes the whole thing very fragile and it's like some sort of apology. So we are with this connection. I believe this is quite obvious. The other problem that I mentioned is capital consumption all that that's less less obvious. Probably and what I have here in mind is that thanks to the printing press you no longer. You destroy a part of the incentives that push people to say, of course, you reduce the intent of to become self-reliant. It's only good food. I've been so on especially you reduce the incentive to save as a consequence. You are diminishing the capital base right now in real terms of the economy. Now the question is how strong is this effect? If you look at the official figures you might think well, it cannot be that strong because we still have increased of capital. Vested in real terms. I looked at the figures as found its true. So this is this is the impression that you get but then of course you also know that governments try to manipulate the figures themselves. And especially in this case the price inflation rate review. You are probably aware of the work of John Williams Shadows dance dados dad's right? So I've been following this for 15 years ago fascinating when I saw this, Because what he's doing is just providing estimates right is no because you don't have the raw data. He's just out of his own experiences just estimating the deviation between the calculated inflation rates with the current methodology and the inflation price inflation rate. That would be calculated with the prevailing methods in the 1980s. So he comes up with differentials of about 7% I think right right now right seven seven nine percent. Sometimes this is Its enormous it's just mind-boggling. So I read through macro economic statistics information about Capital Investments. And so on in the light of his figures and my conclusion was that if you if Williams in is right, then we have been consuming Capital concept is since the mid-1980s something like this and even if he is not entirely right, but it's only half right there probably will be consuming capital for the past 20 years in	0.0
I'm like still crying over the story. So if you do this, that's just me, you know being a worse but it's just um, it's a varied it's an extremely touching story and it is painful when you lose a staff member. So I'm thinking of so you have this yellow day and and you have this celebration of her life in May but leaving up to that time. What? Some of the things that you incorporate into your day into your way of interacting with your human beings, right one of the things that I'll share mine first and then maybe you could share something that you do is this is a really challenging thing to do. It's surprisingly challenging but as you go about your day and you run into 7-Eleven for your you know Snicker bar, not that that happened to me. I'm just saying, you know, I go in there for nothing but healthy things but you run into 7-Eleven. You and you grab something and you're checking out right? Look that person in the eye. It's really hard. It's a hard habit to get into and when they say, how are you how's your day? You know oftentimes your think I got to swipe my card. There's people behind me and I got to kind of find the right change, but we get in the habit of not looking at people when we talk to them or when we're in front of them. And and when that happens, I mean, I just think it becomes we become more disconnected. Even though we're surrounded by people. And so I think that one thing that can help is to become connected. So it's a habit. I'm trying to get better at and I have you know it Ebbs and flows like sometimes I'm better at it than others, but I noticed that I remember back going back to 9/11. So y'all, you know, I've been on this planet a long time some of you are like, oh, yeah, I was too and that happened. I remember when that happened and it was a very strange. couple of weeks strange and that you know one we didn't see our planes in the sky for a couple of days, but then when you would pass random strangers, I'm going to cry thinking about this but um, I'm getting it together here when you were passed random strangers on the street. They would look you in the eye and smile and and greet you which is very it's very different. If you're in a small town happens all the time. If you're in a large city doesn't happen ever like never nobody talks to you. I mean, you just kind of go about your day or base having their little mental conversations and they're going about their day. But for those two weeks we were connected and we were a kind. derp	1.0
Paperwork really before the season started you had to get all of your employment forms and certifications done. Now that you have your team chosen, there are a few more paperwork tasks, which you should do. This is a time when you can be creative. So embrace the fun that comes with coaching. If you're not the creative type. However, you can choose to find some of these items online and save yourself the time regardless of your coaching philosophy. You'll need to be clear about at least one topic during the season team rules while discipline is disgusting. A little later on discipline should only happen after team rules are broken after reading the discipline section create a list of your team rules and print out enough to give to each player and also to distribute to families at your first meeting together this way everyone knows what is expected of them and it's not caught off guard when you take disciplinary action, if you have different levels or kinds of discipline depending on the rule, which is broken list that out as well. Not only will this help deter rule-breaking, but it will also help you. A consistent once you've created your team rules, you need to hand them out to your players while you could just give the paper to each girl and hope she at least keeps it somewhere in her gym bag. I prefer to hand out team rules in a folder which I customized for each player. This could be as simple as writing their name and number in the top right-hand corner. You could get a little more crafty if that's what you're into and add stickers quotes drawings Etc on their folder. It might also be fun to have a folder decorating station at the beginning of this year. Meetings to keep the players entertained while you talk to the families younger players will probably appreciate this more but the right group of high schoolers might enjoy it just as much so why hand out folders when all you're doing is handing out team rules folder is generally more sturdy than the paper which will likely end up crumpled at the bottom of their bag next to a rogue sock which are not even sure is there's but now you have a safe place for other papers to go if needed say you're traveling for a tournament and want to hand out the information at practice. You'll be safe in the folder. Maybe you want to create a habit of writing down team and personal goals before each match that can go on the folder to you're helping yourself in the long run by giving them a safe place to store anything you think is important enough to print out and give to them later on in this book will look at keeping stats for your team in that chapter. I will give you tons of reasons to implement stat tracking in the beginning of your season, but I want to give you a tool now which will help you use stats for each individual on your team. Not just at the broad. Level if you search hard enough online, you can download a personal stat tracker for your players. This encourages one-on-one discussions with your players. If you have the time, but can also be an easy way to communicate about their individual performance and growth without having to use practice time to have these meetings. If you'd prefer to create your own personal stattrak or consider including the following spaces to communicate growth over the season serving percentage passing percentage setting percentage attacking percentage block. Aces assist digs and notes to demonstrate growth. I like to show the team and average percentage not including the most recent match or tournament. Then I have a column with the same stats, but for only the most recent match or tournament, this will show the players how their most recent performance Stacks up against their previous performance during my second year of coaching. I also included the team percentages so they could see where they were in relation to everyone else on the team. I decided to take the stat off of the form itself. Elf and instead share these numbers verbally team stats are a good measure which you should definitely track but you're adding insult to injury when someone realizes they're dragging down the team passing percentage every tournament. They'll know when you announce team stats. There's no reason to include it on their personal stat tracker. If you're going to have meetings after every competition to discuss individual progress, you can give players one sheet, which they can use all years track their stats if you prefer to hand out stats and only have meetings when necessary I Handing out a new sheet after every match or tournament one word of caution on personal stat trackers. Your players can take these very literally and the self-confidence of younger players, especially may suffer communicate with your team that they are a learning tool and cannot capture everything which a player brings to the team enthusiasm and teamwork are just as important, but those are hard to measure add positive comments in the notes section to discuss ways in which a player contributed that is not made obvious by the stats. Building trust and culture remember in the very beginning when I said that some parts of this book will have a greater impact on your season than others. Well, this is one of those areas and it is major right behind your coaching philosophy is your ability to build a positive and productive team culture and while coaching philosophy and culture are of the utmost importance. Your influence will not extend as far as you hope without first building trust to start. Let's talk about trust we all know in our gut when Trust someone or not, but what behaviors actually generate trust think back to your former coaches. Were you ever told you're going to get a lot of playing time today only to sit the bench like always or have you ever gone back to serve only to see your coach panic and call for a substitution, even though they weren't sure who they were going to put in or have you ever asked your coach about playing a new position or trying a new play been told? Yes, and then never get the opportunity these experiences likely deteriorated your trust in. Your coach and impacted your commitment to the team and their goals while it occasionally happens breaking promises to your players or not being prepared for certain situations on a regular basis is one of the quickest ways to fail as a leader of your team. So how do you build and maintain trust for starters? No your coaching philosophy. If you haven't taken the time yet go back to chapter 1 and do this now. This will show you your true coaching personality when you understand that you can create policies around. Values which you are more likely to follow even during high intensity and high-stress situations. How do you do that? It's mostly self-monitoring want to brighten someones day by telling them that they're going to get more playing time. Just don't even if your intention is to get them in don't tell them this a few hours before the match when you're still uncertain of all the playing conditions do they need a heads up? Yes, but only when you know for sure that they're going in not one you think it would be nice if you could get them more playing time. Or if they want to try a new position and you think the time is right let them know before I match so they can warm up in that position. Don't think you'll get them in need them in their regular position. Just tell them that delivering bad or unwanted news is hard. But if your players know that you're being honest with them the trust will build some pointers don't over promise if the answer is no say no explain decisions. If the situation calls for an explanation fight the urge to explain decisions other Eyes say what you mean follow through with promises. If you fail to meet a promise sincerely apologize behind only your coaching philosophy and Trust building team culture is one of the foundations of the Season which you need to make a priority your culture is essentially a mixture of the most dominant personalities on your team and your values in coaching volleyball and girls, especially it's important to maintain a positive and supportive culture.	1.0

I was asking her last night in the Press line at Dancing with the Stars just how her comedy has helped her because she is a physical comedian when you watch her on the office and she said, you know, I don't dance but I was a good imitation. That was actually pretty good. I've watched a little bit of the office myself, but she's at least an understanding of how her body moves and I think that has sort of helped her.	1.0

Um, well, yeah, so we haven't bought any any Bulls right right this minute that are that are really fancy. I mean, I got some calves that I bought from a guy that from ask from a neighbor that are look really good with the dummy and and have got a couple Rider trips on that look like they might Might be really good but I don't want to brag on them yet because they just pretty green. But what are those who you lines? Sorry. What are they two year olds? And you said they had a couple of ridership for the three year olds their fields? And and then then I have I do have a horse coming on a young horse that I call white-hot. He is a solid white horse and he's actually out of that gray mare we were talking about earlier. While Blue well, I got has only had a couple of Rider trips on him, but he won second at Bob Marriott's dirty rotten buckers bucking horse fraternity last summer he one second. I think it was in the bareback ride. Anyway, he looks pretty good. I think that horse he'll be he'll he'll be 5 this year so he got a little more age on him and then some of them because he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he bucks pretty Dang good and and I saw I think that that'll be a up-and-coming star for us this summer moving forward in and there's a there's a couple of other Colts that are that are coming on. I mentioned that Indian burn in that Indian summer line of horses. There's a little brother to Indian burn coming out and he's a a sista numbers 505. He's just a, you know going to be a four year old black yelling and he box Really good. He didn't even have a name yet. I need to come up with a name for it.	1.0

So need gets it gets really dangerous when the smart teams are also the rich teams like the Yankees who have been so very disciplined over the past several years fans screaming go back to the days of old when you threw money at everybody and that's not the way they had operated for the past several years until this offseason and when the perfect storm for them got laid at their feet they needed in a starter Gerrit Cole is Guy that just doesn't seem like he has any alarming issues tied to him at least at the moment. I know that's knock on wood for any pitcher, but there's a reason why he got the money he did and pretty much everybody agrees that he's probably worth it. And so it became a layout for them to be able to get it done. But in the past they have been operated like the Yankees. We used to see in the before the mm rolled around and they were winning world. Oops year after year after year, it's been a little bit of a different dynamic in that front office. And they the Dodgers are sort of a similar team we talked about this when we initially started talking Lindor rumors at the beginning of the offseason and I said one of the things that I think will be interesting is how desperate to these teams get where you've been operating this way like the Dodgers have where you have the strong farm system. You already have a really deep talented roster. You probably don't need to do a lot but are the fans starting to get it to you. There are Upset is just winning the division every single year and hoping that you the two random randomness your way into winning a world title. Are they going to be happy with that or are they going to feel some pressure and that was always something in the back of my mind that that thought. I thought maybe that was something that could help push or escalate a trade of Lindor to a situation like LA because if they're just evaluating this based on spreadsheets and surplus-value. Value years of control cheap control at that guy's that allow them to spend more money on other parts of their roster through free agency. If they would like to the one thing was going to change that was that sense of desperation and needing to change the the way they've gone about things in the past several years and we'll see because They didn't come away with that that major free agent peace or trade piece as of yet. So are they going to feel that sense of desperation as this winter unfolds? I don't know but that was the one thing that was kind of a wild card in my line for getting these these sorts of this sort of trade done.	1.0
They do you do and sometimes its own unique. Yeah, sometimes one-man band and they do I need you ones on Wednesdays. Now. The thing is I've got a box one box honor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Skip because some good concept Governor's numbers.	1.0

He had a free blokes on him every time he did once I come on obviously got a few balls in but mad they remind me a lot of when Wigan first came up or when black ball first came up and they've got that on my God. I can't believe we're in the Premier League. Let's just run like mad all the time and they are getting tired in games. That's why they threw away a lead against man you died last week. They obviously got tired today throughout the last 20 minutes. They would really jaded and that's when we were getting better. Better and better and that's why we are you know, that's why we score so many late goals because we are so fit and we can keep on going experience and we display the same in the first minutes we do in the 90s when you think as well. I think you said about us like planning Europe. I results after playing in Europe already good.

You know, I mean it even higher learning kind of was right, right because you're a college student and athlete again, you know, I mean Not a football player, but a track star so bright that also is showing a different look. So what's the I feel like every actor has a story when asked this question. So what's the role that Got Away the one you either turn down or you maybe you misjudge and like yeah, I don't either the only role they got away from me was in Dead Presidents.	0.0
That's the real quiz at the at the at the molyneux sleep at is the other thing that's wrong is it allowed to run wolf where they were there?

You won't appreciate it. Anyway, so I had to bring my three year old and my nine year old and I'm trying to get my nine-year-old to go first because I know my nine-year-old is fucking all in his head about this that if my three-year-old cries and he's three so he's gonna cry it's going to make my nine-year-old even more anxious and scared. So I'm trying to get him to go for as he refuses to go first.	0.0
That's a class. It's like you seem like a normie if you're going to talk about SpongeBob, you know what I mean? Cause like that's just like wonderful back to you if you just say I watched SpongeBob, okay, but everyone watched one fathers and so if it's your favorite like that's true at least once or twice. Yeah. Like Regular Show or something like that and that's interesting. You know, I mean regular so I eventually time was good.	0.0
Same idea just a different different way, you know, so and that is the rodeos out there freaking me and a buddy. We'll talk another day because some some of the first rodeos were out there and I mean, they're huge like you say keep them there for four hours. Like we're not talking about two or three hundred people talking about five or six seven thousand people.	1.0
So that was that I did a lot of subconscious mind stuff, right and I start to feel better about myself because Because my whole life I've never felt good enough. That was the major thing.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, it's great. And so earlier this week we assess it again and we assess it last week last week. We said you were ready this week. We got on the treadmill and you are able to do five. I mean it's end and after hopping on it and pushing it it passed. So now I've decided to start running.	1.0
Yeah. I don't I didn't I didn't get it. I was oblivious to it. However, I am now sensitive to it for her now.	0.0
Maybe you just	1.0
I like legs like that. I feel like I get a really good workout thing.	1.0
Yeah, you know, I'm actually looking to supplement either I linebacker or defensive line here. Now this just to be quite Frank. This is not a good year for inside linebackers specifically when you start looking at the Packers thresholds now their thresholds for linebackers are actually relatively strict. There's never many prospects that meet them. So I think when they see Layers that are close to the thresholds or even meet them they're jumping all over them and there's only a handful of guys that you're probably even looking at here a guy like drue tranquill from Notre Dame. He's on that. He's on the cusp of meeting all the thresholds. A guy from Catholic. I like Cameron Smith from USC. Bobbio correctly from Stanford, but I didn't hear you. Say Caitlyn Saunders. Is he still available the defensive lineman from Western, Illinois?	1.0
This is not fair to the Dodgers if they pull off a smooth flow. So as I said, if nothing else, it's raise the bar to a level. That when if and when they actually do trade lend or it will look nothing like this trade and so everyone is going to be pissed off they're going to be pissed off regardless, but they're really going to be taste.	0.0
Like you're just like you figure all this shit out.	1.0

It's like when you go all weak and psychos just letting you have access to the Twizzlers and eat them whenever you want without making like a rule around it then maybe you wouldn't have felt the need to like, you know load up on your car when I was away for the weekend.	0.0
I don't know and I did it and I think that that Catalyst we never want to have that happen again, you know, we never want that to happen again, but I think we have to take that message of how we felt by connecting with people. I'm still crying y'all. And I'm going to make you talk now, but all right, but how we felt and bring that to our classroom. So as your students are coming in, you know greet. I know this is people say all the time but greeting them and then looking them in the eye those are kind of two different things. And so when you combine those two things is pretty powerful. Okay. I'm going to get my act together you talk now? Okay.	0.0

And then try to get the next Monday for 20 minutes and that was not pretty yeah, and so like we said, okay well and then I really assess it and it was sore still in that same area and and knowing that you came off a stress fracture last year. We treated it as more a bony injury. So so we ended up deciding to have we didn't get a scan but we've had Three weeks off running and then we're just gradually trying to introduce a little bit of running now to see how it is. So hoping that is just an early stage bone reaction and and then you can slowly get back into running bit legit like we laugh about it now, but that was quite a frustrating time for you like missing that 5K because luckily sort of reported in one of those earlier podcast like we've had some Ames with your 5K and on the track. It's a really good environment. I meant to do a good 5K time. So it was quite frustrating but I thought like you're dealt with it. Well, how did you feel like you handled it?	0.0

The scenery is stunning and it's quite dry at the moment. So it is it's dark and brown, but it's mountainous. And there's the dam. But yeah, it was it was tough. It was very hot to everyone suffered in the heat myself included and I run in the middle of the day most days and yeah, it wasn't easy was it was really hard but that's what we doing. What are we doing to stop we go to Suffer Well, yep. You're the worst worst of conditions the better the suffering. Yes, a bit of the same flaws of the end. It was very unceasingly hot having said that for the number of races that I've been to or watched online this year in South East Queensland. It would appear that it's either been unceasingly hot or unceasingly cold during the actual races. It's just the way the year stand out. Yeah interesting. It makes you respect Mother Nature that	0.0

I wrote both, you know through high school and college and instead started and I guess I bought my Pro card in 96 anyway, and I rode around and got on lot of balls on the west coast. What it what had happened is I do to getting beat up and Andrew and stuff. I kind of had to give it up yum. I was only 25 or 24 when I quit But I threw getting on a lot of bulls out here on the West Coast. I became friends with Don Kish and getting on his balls all the time and go to go into their rodeos when I got beat up real good. The last time I guess 99 there. I he he called me when I was in the hospital and get offered me a job to come out and weld for it. Well, I was beat up and like I said, he beat up enough to where I can. I couldn't do too much like couldn't lift too much or do too much buddy buddy called and we had been like I said friends before need any dawn said would you like to come home and and weld for me? I'm trying to build this feed lots of these bulls. And and all I had to do is set in well, you guys are probably familiar with putting up pipe and cable fins. And and so I just had to set there and weld them the Milliron on the post to run the cable through and so on that that winter I came or well, I got hurt at Fort Worth. So it was about this time of the year anyway, and that came home and welded for dog. Well, anyway, it evolved into going to work for he and John crowning and and I work for the rodeo company therefore started in 99 and started, you know, discontinued helping Dawn with bulls and then really started getting involved with the horse part of it. You know while working for the rodeo company and then No.5 John offered me an opportunity to buy into the company and by the horses from the company which Saudi I did definitely at the time they they provided the horses and Don had two bullets on the ground. Right? Right. That's exactly right. So John own on the horses and then Dawn on the Bulls and then John also on the time of in cattle. I guess. That's anyway. and so through working around there for four or five years there and I started flanking the horses I guess and probably like oh three and then again just got an opportunity there and bought the horses and oh five and and then kind of well, I don't want this to sound wrong. But you know the horse program when I bought it and I'll five it was it was struggling, you know, there was I think there was a couple or three maybe horses going to the final and and and not a real real and I don't want this to come across like I'm saying anything derogatory. I'm not I'm not I'm just kind of trying to lay out the facts the breeding program. For the horses wasn't real organized. You know, there was kind of not sure what calls were out of what two mares. You know, there was some paperwork loss. You know, it's kind of a oh, yeah Club not a real not a real organized situation and not hey and not to say that I don't feel have some hiccups here and there today. I'm just saying, you know five it was in there was a lot of I did all the information wasn't there. But anyway, So then what I did is, you know first thing I did when after buying the horses sorted up the mayor's kind of got the you know, the mayor's that I thought were the best Mayors and certainly as we all know if you raise bucking stock you the ones you think that are the best at the you know, your first year or two into it, maybe they're not the best and and and then the one that you're that you don't breed all the sudden, you know later on you wished you kick yourself in the butt and think gosh. should have been breeding them are you know, she she was at first maybe wasn't the shiniest one in the herd, but you know, they stay hooked and they stay you know, they just stay solid and today that's the one thing I've learned now being, you know, whatever 13 years 14 years into this but one thing I have learned is the ones that are solid and consistent for me the mayor's that do that seem to be the ones that raised the better horses the that they've The Bucks in them. They're just they maybe aren't the most talented but they give it to you every time they might only be in 1819 pointer. But if they do that out of her time, that's probably in my experience that's you know, only 13 14 years into this pretty Limited in the horse industry because you know, you think of them other guys, I was talking about earlier. Oh, yeah, you guys that there's there's like guys like a cork. Oh they've been doing this 50 50 years, you know, so so when I talk about 13 or 14 Teen years. I might my experience is a little bit limited compared to those guys obviously, but in my limited amount of time here going back to what I thought the solemn are the ones that just give it to you what they what they can every time and and do something every time 1819 Point hoppers for me. Those have been the ones that have been the best moms, you know, and I don't know why that is. I wish I had a magic ball to look into and figure out why that is but But you know the the the ones that jump out there and just make your mouth water rank as hell one time. And then the next time maybe aren't as shiny. They the consistency it for whatever reason that that genetic trait of consistency doesn't doesn't carry on to their you know, their Colts have that same enemy. You know what they're just not consistent in any way so that send the Colts out of those.	0.0

I mean, I'll God I'm speaking right to the I'm speaking right to the British people who are trying to outlaw loot boxes, but that feeling when I got as a surprise was really nice because I didn't spend 18 effing dollars on its so having it this Nice little surprise while it boom orange.

So I gue antagonize just enough to get them to realize the To within themselves just like the movie Rudy. He wasn't agonized his whole life.	1.0
Yeah, that's a great point. And one of the things we've noticed is it's been uh, it's been small single digits over the past in 15 plus years and we're projecting it to climb to almost a third of the construction starts in terms of dollars spent and that's a that is a huge shift in the way in which projects are built and it's In amount of large projects and the challenges they're becoming is proliferation of these large projects and the experience on them is largely bad from a cost standpoint from a schedule standpoint. We are seeing as I mentioned this at the Kirk conference from our point of view and working with contractors. We're seeing lots of what I will call voluntary exits from a space. So contractors that are saying we've gotten into these large projects we've had bad. Experiences we've lost a ton of money in the case of some public companies. We've lost a lot of Share value and we are strategically pivoting out of that market and we are going to go find work elsewhere. Well what other contractors participate in the reproductive and then there are you know, sort of what I've referred to as the involuntary exits is we have seen a lot of in the past 24 months is contractor bankruptcies, even for some of the largest companies in our industry that go belly-up as a result of being involved. These big projects that get sideways and they can they can take down even even a really large contractor.	1.0
Come on guys, get it together ever been.	0.0
I'm just saying let's not act like there's no act like it ain't you ain't true that you know allegations ain't always been out there Sion right on stuff. Yeah.

Okay, and then you touched on like him, you know getting in the beef and shit like that with other rappers and stuff like that. I just seen like Snippets of the stuff with him on that Ebro and he still talking popping off his like second. I wanted to get behind them after I watch that Breakfast Club interview that he did it was like, okay, maybe he's in misunderstood. He turn right back around saying how like the you know, the older the older generation should basically should you know should thank them and shit like that. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Like come off am like we were I was rooting know the hold the Vivica Fox me my was rooting for you. That's that's how I was now. It's kind of like, I don't know FAMU just you switching up on me too much. So yeah with that being said those would have the songs that I like the most on it without no talking too much on it at that made man was hot. It was probably that was probably my favorite song at all. A made man was hot like the said the Wild Wild West Joy I'm with her. I wasn't gonna that shit was tight to and I said the cardi B Carter be stole that, you know saying she had the best verse on on the whole album to me do anything for clout? Yeah. She had the best verse on the album on the entire album with all those features Gucci. It was a lot of features to like, I think it was like 16 songs and like eight of the songs have features on them. So that's a bit much for my for my taste. I mean, you got 16 songs. I don't want to see more than like for features. Just my personal my personal preference, but that for that I'll give it a go give it a two and a half out of five. I'm gonna give it a two and a half. It was the best out of every solo project from them.	1.0

How did it feel after you made it good? That's like the best feeling. Yeah. Yeah. All right guys. Well, thanks for coming on and hope you have a good offseason and be ready to back go back again next year. Oh right on the volleyball side of things what a season for the girls coming into the year. The focus really was on everyone that graduated the girls return just two players from last year. And the question was could the young players on this team play well enough to compete at the varsity level. There was obviously some talent but what it translate to Varsity the first year and the answer ended up being a very definitive. Yes, the girls went 12 and 2 and won their first dvcac championship since 2004 15 years ago. Oh, that's a long time and this wasn't like soccer because the boys had been there the last several years and they were kind of expected to be back in the championship for the girls. This was kind of Uncharted Territory. And as I was standing there watching the consolation game before the championship the girls looked like they were locked in and ready now hindsight is always 20/20, but they looked like a team that was ready to go win a championship and it showed right from the start of the game. They just look like they were much more prepared to play in a game of this magnitude than their opponent was they won. The first game 25:21 and pretty much Controlled it the whole way. It just never felt like Chestertown could get any momentum going in that first set. And the thing is we made a lot of serving errors. I'm not sure the exact number in the first set but we made 13 serving errors overall. That's a lot. So if you take away those serving errors, this was a complete domination in the first little bit of the game. That was the only way Chestertown with scoring. We were doing everything else better than them. And after that first win the girls came out with a lot of energy momentum and were dominating the second set. I think it was like 16 to 7 when Chester town called a timeout and coming out of the timeout they were able to regroup and start to play their game a little bit. They came all the way back and we're within 24 23 and they were serving the ball and they served it out of bounds and gifted us that last point for a 25-23 win. And now it was to nothing the last set started off poorly for GMS Chestertown. Got an early lead in maintain that for a long time. It felt like our girls maybe it just taking their foot off the gas a little bit. They just weren't as crisp with their And their hits as they had been in the first two sets, but they got a timeout refocused eventually took their first lead at 17 16 and then didn't look back with a score of 2421 Chester town called their final timeout, but it didn't help Amber Humphries served up an ace For the Win. It was a very exciting moment for the girls as they celebrated their well-deserved Championship. So really the question for this season was how do you go from losing almost your entire team the year before including two All-Stars and one all-conference player and Glee start brand new in win a championship with that team and I think a big part of that is good coaching the coaches recognize where their strengths and weaknesses were and put girls in positions where they could use those strengths and not have to do things. They couldn't do and coaching is great. But ultimately it comes down to the players on the court and you had two freshmen coming this year who were very good hitters and Amber and Kailyn and so you wanted to get them hitting as much as you can and in order for them to be able to hit you need good sets and Riley will pretty much give you a good set every single time even if she The bad path she's going to set her hitters up with a quality opportunity for a kill the strategy is if you can get Riley setting the Amber and killing as much as possible. You're going to be in good shape. Not a lot of teams in our league have three players as good as those three and it showed in the championship game and then aside from those three, you want your other three players on the court to be able to minimize mistakes and make the easy plays you want them to be able to dig when needed give Riley a good pass for a set. You want them to build a serve well and not make a lot of serving errors and I think they did that between Amanda Renee. Elsie and Emily you got solid role players that allowed the team to succeed they knew their jobs and they performed them well, and I think this team really showed what good teamwork can do for the success of a team in any sport not everyone's going to play the same role on the team. Some players are going to get more action more hits more shots, whatever it may be and the players need to recognize their role and buy into it for a team to be successful and the girls did that a lot of that's on the coaches to put them in those roles and make sure the players clearly understand their roles and in my opinion, that's Made this team great and weren't that tall? In fact, there are high school volleyball team. They would be probably considered short. So when you watch them play, it's not like a jump out at you right away, but they just worked really well together and understood their roles and brought home a banner to hang in the gym and the future looks very bright for GMS volleyball Riley's just a sophomore Kailyn and Amber are freshmen Emily and Kelsey are freshmen you lose to girls abandon Renee and you'll need to replace them. They played well, but there are some quality players coming up for the Middle School ranks next year and I think you're looking potentially at another really good year and I think I think they should be the favorites in the league heading into next season a few Awards to recognize here for volleyball Kaelyn Amber Riley and Amanda were all chosen to play in the dvcac All-Star Game. Amber was second in the league in Aces with 43 and forth in kills with 82 Riley led the league in assist with 172 and she led an Aces as well with 45 and second place for us. This was 78 so that each shows what a wide margin. She led a sister. She had a hundred seventy two second was 78 Kelsey was 19th. And Aces with 12. Amanda was ninth in Aces with 18 and Calum was first in kills with 125 forth in Aces with 31 and seventh in blocks with seven. There was a little bit of controversy with the volleyball All Conference team when the teams were first announced that the All-Star Game a couple of weeks ago. Kalyn was named all-conference and she was the only one from GMS to be named all-conference. They chose six players that night to be recognized as all-conference members now, they got it wrong. There was some miscommunication there there should have actually been eight players selected for that team. And so what happened is the His went back and re voted for two more players to be added to the all-conference team. And when they did that both Amber and Riley were selected. And so we ended up with three All Conference members Kalin Amber and Riley. I do think it's kind of absurd that Riley especially was not named all-conference originally in the top six. I think if you look at both the stats that she put up and just watch her play. You would know that. That she definitely is one of the six best players in the league and maybe could make the case that she's the most important player in the entire league. If you look at again her assist numbers 172 assist compared to second place with 78. She led the league in Aces as well. I think that she should have been on that top 6, but regardless they got it, right eventually her and Amber were also named to the all-conference team. So congratulations to those three. Kaelan, Riley and Amber. All right. I'm joined Now by Renee and Amanda. Hi, so you guys did not play volleyball last year. You decided to play this year for your senior year all in all.

We had JJ here TJ Jackson by a few weeks ago. He's one of my favorites, but I said I said this to him and I'll pass this on to you when I saw the tour in Los Angeles you guys were at the tail end of the tour oftentimes when you see the tail end of a tour everyone's tired and injured.

I love the like, I think it was called The Warp Zone or something, but it pretty much look like a Nintendo controller and even have like Megaman on the screen or whatever but it's a Mastiff. You don't always get a Mastiff, but if you get like an R3 or re 99, you could get that every round if you really tried exactly right so	1.0

Okay, so well, probably one of the most famous horses we take in the finals is is sock.

Think o 506 taught that that period of time and took him to the finals a few times 1 branca the NFR and it's the ear. He the year he won that actually I sold him to stay Smith and that you know, Moulin Rouge was a real famous horse. We took now beaver fever. She went for hacks you went from all five till last year and then we retired her beaver beaver fever with a heck of a good horse for us. And then and then in fact one of her sons went to the finals last year be verb and he went to in a foreigner bronc riding and then all raggedy Anne Capone.	1.0
All right. Well a few moments ago, as you said it was his New York come up all happening at the same time. You mentioned puffy because at that that time bad boy was was blowing up and one of the groups that blows up you have a personal connection to so when we come back from the break we are going to talk about you and the lovely mrs. ABS one member of the group Total certainly one of my favorites growing up. So we're going to talk about her and I'm gonna put you on the spot about a couple things. All right, so don't get too worried. Well get a little bit worried but more with me how you started out co-ed. So you like watch what a hook but more with Omar Epps when we come back. You know, it's not a lot of people I think to these like in these times especially like writing is such an underrated ability and the fact that you've been writing, you know, your whole life is really incredible considering, you know, again, it's just not an ability. I think that a lot of people have is one that's underrated so much so that you follow this path of writing that you wrote a book right from Father list of fatherhood.	1.0

No, I agree. I'm really excited draft is always been kind of my thing as well. I've watched it every year really going back to when I Javon Walker was drafted. I've watched almost every round every year since then so it's been a long time of watching the draft on and on this guy's case and and in recent years I've gone with you guys a little bit with the threshold and what focusing on the relative Athletic score and doing a little more mocking and just reading up lil bit more and kind of paying more attention to people who aren't named Mel. But we look at this year specifically there is a lot going on for what the Packers could do their work in free agency over the past week bringing in a miss the Smith and Billy Turner have really made things a little less clear as to what they're going to do in the draft. They don't have to go get an edge right away. They don't have to go get alignment right away tight end to you probably should but if there's there's still options out there for what Brian go to comes can do and this is the perfect draft class for him to make moves and move around and get the guy. He wants no matter what position it might be a couple.	1.0

Crispr has nine and you can edit things and fix things and they were able to make they're able to do things and like they were able to basically cure HIV in most mice that had it because you know, they they got mice that had HIV and erotic. Okay. Now we're going to try to get basically get rid of so they use crisper and they're able to get rid of HIV so their plan now is to try it out on humans and see if that works and I mean I mean, that's one of the biggest steps.	1.0

And obviously, you know, I'm a big animal Advocate and conservationist.

Definitely because those are the years when I mean you're rebelling the most at least well, I feel like I did and I didn't want to do something or you know, I was like, oh No One's Gonna Know? It is if I just skip class or go out for lunch with the seniors or something or yeah come in late.	1.0
Thank you.	1.0
Oh, yeah. No, just I want to say thanks to you guys for having me on appreciate it and I want to want to anything that grows the Western way of life and and if my thoughts and our business. What you know can add to that and add to the rodeo business and make it better. That's what we're here for. You know, it's a something we grew up around and something we've always loved my wife and I and our all our kids we want to we want things to go good and go directional the time for everybody and and certainly thankful to be a part of it.	1.0
You know, you're in great shape or I want to be like you right? I don't I truly don't believe that I would be in the shape. I am now if it wasn't for my environment, right like you are what your environment is if I hang out with a whole bunch of depressed people most likely I'm going to be depressed if I hang around with people that are usually up like really positive most likely I'll be positive if I'm hanging around people that all Count Their macros and go to the gym six times a week most likely I'll be fit right etcetera. So I am kind of humbled. I'm occupation, but the same time if I worked at nine to five or ten to six whatever it's either I got to wake up really early in the morning and be tired and work out or go to the gym after work where I'm tired and work out. So I understand like how hard it must be for people to have consistency. Like you have to make it a daily plan where you're going to go designate this time and just execute and stick with it. Right and accountabilities huge. You know, that's why I said It's important to have somebody that could keep you in check. Whether is your best friend your brother or your spouse or a trainer a coach whatever but honestly with those people I completely understand. I think the goal is really just to find a balance in your life. Like it's not everybody's goal to be in the next bikini competitions not everybody's goal to be the next powerlifter. It's not everybody's goal to run a mile in, you know, five minutes six minutes. I think just follow what makes you happy with his Jiu-Jitsu that you love if it's basketball. All that you love if it's yoga that you love just continue to do that and you know be mindful of your nutrition. I think for me what's really worked is intermittent fasting is give me it gives me a block where I could eat at a particular time also count my calories and I think that gives me flexibility with feeding Cravings think counting calories is a huge skill that a lot of people don't consistently do and I'm a big advocate of that because that really changed my life ever since we watched The Hodgetwins that's how I learned counting calories. Calories in versus calories out. These guys are eating chicken the chicken nuggets. They're eating pizza. They're having Taco Bell and they're still looking good and I was like, I was confused. What do we eat for dinner? Like I was under the conventional thought that you have to eat brown rice chicken and broccoli meal prep your food in order for you to be fit. But you don't yeah, you don't like you. All you have to do is track your calories do a little bit of cardio hit a little bit of resistance just baby steps like when my favorite quotes is by Bruce Lee and he says I do not fear the man. The kick is 10,000 times. I fear the man the kicks once a day for ten thousand days. So at the end of the day, it's not about short-term intensity. It's about consistency. Right just it's it's the accumulation of the little things that matter right? It's habits is where we're creatures of habit. So I think that's about anything in life. If you want to be successful in anything. It's really just about consistency. That's it.	1.0
So when they're talk to my pastor, I'm going to I'm going to come there. I went there with Sigma.	1.0

But the other thing is that like Oliver and Miley are like in the end and the end of episode like talking about how close they were like out like stuff.	1.0
Well, I think you see it in the case of Greece right when the socialist government came to power the wake of 2009 to to positive the 10 2010 to the left actually, so they got elected because they promised to get wreath out of the Eurozone. Yeah, okay, and they did this they got elected but they didn't take grease all over Europe politicians lying. Well surprise surprise, but I think they were honest when they were running to be elected and then actually they did a lot of learning and they Folly considered what their options were. And the truth is grease dropping out of the Eurozone would have suffered an enormous door back in really comes. Okay, this is this is there's no comparison. I don't say it wouldn't have been good for the country at the long run. Yes. I do believe it would have been good for the country in the long run. Especially if you're no longer on the monetary Lifeline right on the heart-lung machine then well, actually your own economy starts developing organic. Actually production becomes more important than just spending spending money, especially spending other people's money. So that's certainly a good thing but that they would not have survived this politically and actually most of the voters probably would not have liked it. Anyway speaking of Greece right Aristotle once said that actually most people were born to be slave simply people actually most people they they they they don't mind but other people are telling them what they should do and how they should So on as long as they have a nice cozy house and a car and they have enough to eat and saw that they had basically these Aristotle it said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Yeah. Well, I mean for him. Yes, of course that that was the only life worthy of man. Yeah, and as as a rational being so what is our objective as a rational being its he would say well to contemplate those things that they are terminal. But that is not the opinion of most people so I think coming back on the Eurozone their fight. I think even though the problems are greater than the periphery. The cost of moving away from the Eurozone are also greatest in the periphery Germany could remodel The Zone it would be hard but Germany would get along I think actually would be a great relief for Germany because right now contrary to what politicians in Germany always profess maybe that Germany's greatest beneficiary of the Eurozone. I think we actually the guys are funding this writing in real terms because all we what we exporting are real goods and services and what we are getting Hey, what's up promises?	0.0
So I just feel like being very body positive and I try to like also like bring that out and others It's because I don't I don't think I've talked about this on the podcast yet. But I've had this like weight loss Journey where I was 300 pounds. I still like felt pretty good in my skin at that time. But I've lost like I don't know like a hundred and twenty pounds no big deal. It's like but like learning to like love yourself at both sides and seeing your imperfections because I still feel at this size like not good enough. And like not hot enough and what has really helped me accept myself is actually nudes. If I'm being 100% honest. I've gone from a size 0 to size 6 back down back up and I can find flaws at any size. But I think at some point you just have to look for the things you love as opposed to like picking out the things that you hate right and I still definitely picked myself up are same but it's so helpful to be like, oh my God look at me. I look at like what this body has accomplished always want to look at you. I always want to look at you and I do girlfriend. Look at them bubs. Oh my God, so I guess that's that's the T if you want to take a sip.	1.0
No, she was fantastic and I love these because this is something that you can do yourself or something like that at this point.	1.0
Hey, what's up? Everyone? Hope you're doing awesome. Welcome to the podcast today. We're gonna do something a little bit different. I've interviewed a few people will keep it completely Anonymous but people with good marriages and talk a little more about boundaries and dating people, you know, Kristen I when we look back and we say we look back at our dating time. It's very often that will say man. I'm so glad we you know, I'm so glad we did that. I'm so glad we had that boundary what we look back and Man, if we could do it over we would do this a little bit differently. So I've sat down with a couple people and ask them questions and going to give you some feedback of boundaries and dating things to do things that were the right thing to do before marriage, maybe some things to do differently and break some things down here. So one of the couples that I spoke to you know, a lot of them actually came out to be the same thing and I think overall the the main voice as a Christian and and people called to the ministry. Yeah, but even just in general you're called to something as a child of God. You have a call on your life. It may be a Ministry calling. It may be a call to business. It may be whatever it is. But one of the main things that everyone repeated over and over Is We I made sure to speak the vision to be very clear and plain about speaking the vision that God has for my life and I thought it's interesting because the next question that you know in mind when I heard that was is it'd be pretty safe to say that you'd To have a vision for your life before you should be getting married. You know, I think it's interesting and Adam and Eve in the garden that God gave him a work to do first. And so God gave him this job. He named all the animals. He was to attend he knew exactly what God had sent him to do and then God gave him a wife you hear preachers all the story is if you don't have a job, you shouldn't be trying to get married. Yeah, just saying if you ain't got a job. You don't need a wife. What do you boo? What is she supposed to be a helpmeet? What is she helping with you? Trying to she coming in to do your dish? This is what she'd what's happening. And you kind of get it to do your laundry. He supposed to be a helper for the mission. You know, I think that's where people get off. One of the things that the one of the couple said is, which is awesome. You just said the first couple he said, you know, we I'm I made it a purpose. I look forward to my life as a life as a married couple and we want to serve God full out and I made it a purpose to do those things while we were dating. So serving the lord he We purposely plugged in to church more we served. He said we would go Soul winning together. He said I wanted he said the pace that we were running while we were dating is the pace that we were running now and he said something interesting and this may rub people the wrong way, but he said we weren't always minded just on on dating. He said I wasn't so dating minded. He said I was Kingdom. He didn't say Kingdom on it, but that's basically what it's saying. He said I was I set my eyes on doing the things that I was doing by myself before the relationship and then I wanted to be doing once we were married. Read so they were winning Souls together. He said I wasn't we weren't always just watching movies together and going on dates and going to the beach. He said it's not even things that are wrong. He's like, it's just things that are carnal. He's like you're in a people get in a carnal relaxed mode, but you need to be in a place of like going after the things of God and so you can tell in the marriage. I mean, they're having a great impact. They're called to the mission field but doing the things together that they wanted to do with their life when you look at the call of God on your life. What is that? Look, like is it is it winning Souls, if you're if you're a Christian, we're going to talk about that in a later podcast, but you're called the wind soul is your relationship should have that included in it. It should be something that you shouldn't be embarrassed to share the gospel with somebody if you're with your girlfriend if that should be a red flag if you're with your girlfriend or boyfriend and you have to tone down the things of God. You're not in the right relationship where you have one of those around them.	0.0

Yeah, you know that might have been what it was because I was never around like a liberal Christians. It was the very extreme. Evangelical fundamentalist and I didn't know that that was like a small sect of Christianity like even recently I just thought that that was normal Christianity and I was like, you know always made to feel like, you know, any type of disagreement was just you're not being a real Christian. You're not being a good Christian. But yeah from the very beginning it was just like this constant theme of Of like you think your life is good now, but it can be so much better like is if you believe in Jesus like you will be like infinitely better. And yeah, it's funny like you mentioned the bedside moments because I still like so vividly remember sitting in my bed one morning when I was 12, and I was praying to God and attempting to repent for my sins, but I just kept saying Did I didn't know what I had done wrong? Like I didn't understand why I was so unworthy and undeserving of his love. I didn't like feel like I was the sinful person that was filled with like the innate evil of Adam and Eve like that. They let into this world. But like that's what I was reading. And that's what I believe like it was the inspired word of God. I thought it was true and all the worship songs in youth group and stuff just kept saying like I want more of you God and less of me and it just kind of like shrunk. I'd like shrunk myself down and felt like I must have been doing something wrong in his eyes and like for that I was truly sorry and you know begged for his forgiveness. And I don't know it was just like this constant theme of know your place like you are inferior by Design and I didn't realize it back then but that was like when my healthy amount of self-worth started to Chip Away And it was like crazy that that was like the moment that I dedicated my life to Christ. Yeah, and then like for 10 years after that Christianity kind of consumed my life my friend group. We would have liked deep discussions all the time. I would go to youth group devotional groups summer school, like summer camps Bible studies. I was a youth leader for a while. And it was just a very like simple Faith but I was always told that you're not supposed to intellectualize your face or critically think too much about it. And I kind of feel like not teaching apologetics is like doing a disservice to your congregation because you know people might hear about these things eventually and then I mean that's like what happened to me in my last semester of college after You know, I was 22 so it had been 10 years. My roommate was a religious studies minor and she was doing all of this research for her classes. And you know, she was having like people that were on the committee of translating the ancient Greek manuscripts like as her teacher and they were telling her these things that I just knew nothing about and it was that same sort of feeling I had when I was 12, it was like wow, like I'm so ignorant like there's so much more. I need to know. And so I that's when I like started my deep study of Theology and I went into it as a Christian wanting to be a better Christian thinking that I was going to like, you know be so solid in my faith and then just as I continue down that path like things slowly started to like not make sense with like the Christian doctrine and my faith was like unraveling I guess in my questions. We're too hard and Too Deep for the Christians around me to answer I guess so I was kind of on my own and I yeah, I decided that like I just didn't think the facts were there. But honestly the damaging part came like after I left like once I just decided I don't think this is true. I don't think I'm going to call myself a Christian anymore. That's when I started like feeling the damaging effects of like what? It happened like the past 10 years, basically.	0.0

Well, that's the one thing I was kind of fearing was like cause you played a bit of the multiplayer to you kind of got you you kind of got them familiar with some of these people who are like Titanfall veterans where they were grappling and then once they got like to a certain speed you basically could just go around the map by sliding and sliding and jumping over and over and never losing speed and every time you do you use the grapple, right? So exactly like I think that would make it pretty hard for Apex just because time to kill is just so much slower in Apex and if someone's moving that fast it might be a little bit difficult true true about it.	1.0
Interesting. Do you find that doing Bryce? I mean, obviously you have to embrace that sort of dark applies inside that we all kind of go to some point. They like do you have like a strategy for dealing with the really- places in a race, you know, we need to go deeply into the dark Parts.	1.0

Let's bring it out there and well, I'm I'm really guilty of like sharing memes all in like inspirational quotes and things like that on Instagram all the time talking about you anxiety and self-care and you know how you can manage it and sure that sounds nice and fluffy, but not all the time. Can we manage it with memes and coffee? And taking a bubble bath. So right which I mean it all helps but yeah, sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah, we'll see so so I know Audrey and I have spoken obviously beforehand about our previous experiences with anxiety and we have both in in overtime bin both diagnosed with a clinically diagnosed with anxiety. So I thought what we do first is kind of tell our like a briefly tell our story about how the It impacted us and then kind of what we're doing with it now and then maybe talk about some ideas of how we can other than a bubble bath how we can kind of help to relieve some of that anxiety when we're having those stressful days. Yeah, you wanna go first.	1.0
Um, I mean, I was friendly with them. I wasn't like part of like the group though. Like they were big-name fans and I was a big name fan but I was like off sort of on my own. They think like I contributed to like the different events that they did but I wasn't like in like the planning or in that group at all.	1.0
Saying I'm glad to see that and I love that you're sharing the experience with Pasha your husband, of course because I think what was interesting I spoke with you. I don't know if you remember but I did a quick interviewed everyone on Derrick storm. And we did like a phone or a I think everyone just passed her on the phone. We're like next next you remember that number? Okay. It's good to put a face now. Yes, but what I think was really interesting was that Pasha was the one who actually encourage you to do Derrick storm. Yes, and I you know you guys A team and you guys have to make decisions as a team. You have a studio you compete together.	1.0

It's lazy writing. Honestly, like very lazy writing. That's this whole show has lazy writing and I'll definitely have a couple more notes about At but I just was like dog and and while they were in the car, all of the lines were total plot narration, like explaining and feeding the audience stuff that we didn't already know which I guess is like Fair because it's only the second episode by you just referring to the fact that like Oliver had a crush on her.	0.0
So what so time and you do not mind me asking I can't remember exactly was a bit under 18 hours.	1.0

You know, what funny thing that you just said that I actually didn't know those houses existed to like about a week ago. We had to bail on Landing in slums just because there's so many people going and then my one friend took us under it's like kind of underneath the waterfall right? Are you talking? Okay? How's this? Yeah, I was like there's places here. So that yeah, like it's definitely a kind of nice little area tucked away. Yeah.	1.0
I'm sure when people started saying that I mean, do you actually see the resemblance or you just like nah, at first I didn't and I'm like, I guess when I grow my beard out I was like, okay we look he can look like my older brother's wife Lisa. I was like, what do you think? She was like a little bit, right? Okay, so you can you can take it they say we all have a doppelganger somewhere in the universe.	1.0
Yeah, so that is being mileage and and obviously Joe do you use like are you training for of paint your pace going training on heart rate or just your perceived effort? Do you just do things like feel a lot or like, you know, maybe mainly feel yeah.	1.0

Yeah it was and so when I first started right at home staging I went into it thinking I'll just do pre-sale consults and I'll just get my experience through that but very very quickly. I realized that people wanted their In properties furnished and so I had to then go and every job I got where I needed Furniture. I would just buy for that house and it has just accumulated over time, but I don't have any higher options. I think Canberra is probably the closest and that's 3 hours away. So in a regional area, it is a huge investment at the beginning to grow your inventory and I have no regrets like I absolutely love it. But yeah, you do have to act like quite a lot. Yeah, no, definitely an egg because you've got your own stock.	1.0
How does this is a know? I said, I wouldn't do this but a little side question when you talk about branding as I mentioned before that you like to get in front of camera, and I've noticed on your website. Everything you're not shy about putting your face and telling people who you are, which I love I love them and I say it all the time to people people buy from people. So, I believe that letting people know who you are and what you're about can only be a benefit in your business. How are you? How does that tie into your branding?	1.0
Know that you're the baddest bitch. Yes, like feel yourself know yourself like in a really like intimate way right because gonna help so much young you're intimate with somebody else in like I think that is actually what I've realized over the years. Like I've been so much more like open and like willing to like put myself out there a little bit more than I'm used to because I like I'm starting to actually like myself. Oh, yeah, which is so great and I just feel like you Have to do it in your own way and if like you're not comfortable taking a nude, please don't feel like I'm forcing you to although one time. We did Force chaplain 2 times the first time but I have always just been a person I grew up in a naked house like that me my mom would was we were always naked like we had a pool we skinny-dipped before bed because like it was just cool our bodies down my moms, like don't even be naked in the shower.	1.0

But I got the job. That's awesome. So yeah, they built out a whole new studio me and three other guys got hired. We were shooting products. We shot commercials for we shot with athletes. We shot, you know commercials for the North Face. What a great start. It was insane. Yeah. I was I now that's when you talk about luck. That's when I felt lucky and I still disagree though.	1.0
Yes, I did that quite quick, but they just won't come to my head when I speak about it might seems a bit. It's very similar. The only difference is I've got Cameron ball three Jackson at left-back. All right, man. Where is he now? I mean I didn't exist.	1.0

They were plenty of those 90s films that came my way that I was like, yeah. No, I'm good. All right, you know what I'm saying? And at the same time in the midst of that I did, you know a film for HBO called Daybreak. I did a film called deadly Voyage face, but you know what?

From gimlet media. I'm Josh puccio and this is the pitch. On today's episode a Founder pitches his startup meant to provide TurnKey mobile apps for retailers. He insists it's unlike anything else on the market but in a world where it seems everyone has an app can be convince investors. There's really an opportunity here. Bill Nadel is with Forefront Venture Partners. Phil is all about the numbers will only go in on a deal if you can make the math work. If for some reason the members don't bite then the thing falls apart Jillian Maness is with structure Capital. She's quick to size up the potential in a start-up and its founder and you can count on her to put her money where her mouth is there is no doubt in my mind that you're going to do this. I really feel that Daniel Galati is with Comcast. He loves the high stakes of venture capital and he'll take a gamble on a long shot startup if he senses an opportunity in the billions. I think the only way to make money in VC is to take a non consensus view that turns out to be right and finally on today's episode angel investor James Alta jerr.

No be used to buy the Krieg again ever that's it goes to price where people could practice with in real matches and they finally got good with it and put the price back up. So it's still worth buying but now like you don't want it, like people will expect to Krieg nerve to be like you just need to get basically volt this gun put it into a position where no one sees it anymore. Then the game will be fixed. So everyone can use a case. That's not what valve want and they are trying to see if there's a world where you can use both guns situationally it It'll be it'll be a bit better to have a creek but not too much that it ruins the game. Maybe the I think putting the price back up was like in general what most people thought would be a good idea. So yeah. Yeah, so I think I think it's a good idea, but that's sick and then didn't cash.	0.0
Then we cover it with re calling because they've got an option on a character as well as well have my up front. So when I face Yugi can't record it now. He's he's not good enough to Warrant calling back. I disagree. I like that's one thing. I think we should call it your player buffing with the current stay at the school. Now, I would have him yeah long-term he for me.	0.0
It was I mean, we did definitely clean up a lot and what I liked about the tour as well as we didn't get too comfortable. So every like two weeks we would try to take well actually every night we would take one dance and we would Like that one dance to make sure okay. Are we on sorry. I was in the right spot. Are we on our marks? All right. Let's try to make this better. So every single night we'd have one dance we'd focus on so that that night it would be a good like a good quality number with a right positions and makes you like make sure it's clean. So I think because of that it really helped towards the middle and end of the tour to stay clean because we did try and perfect the dances one at a time instead of like kind of Try to do everything will open the whole show doesn't necessarily work. No, so dedicating one day to one dance really really truly helped a lot. And I think that's that was the key.	1.0

Welcome to the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host Jake shorter. And today I am joined by Jessica Dwyer of right at home staging which is located on the sapphire Coast in New South Wales. There's a couple of things in particular probably three that I found really interesting about this interview. The first one is that just is located in her business is located in a very Regional or even rural area and I guess we talked about some of the difficulties that she faces as part of that and I know that she's not alone in that in around Australia. We also talked about The fact that the her staging business is only one of two businesses that she runs she actually has a retail physical retail store as well. So I talked a bit about how that fits in with her staging business how it complements it and also the difficulties in running two businesses at the same time. And the third one that we get into is a little bit of an online shop idea that she's had to help increase or add another revenue streams part of her staging business and in particular she has set up a dream packages. That she sells locally to various people and and I found it really interesting. And I know that she's not alone in setting up an online store as a another source of Revenue. So we kind of talked about her thoughts behind it and what she has found very successful and difficult in saying that up. She also finishes, I guess the interview with an answer to my question which I often ask but don't get a great answer which is what is something weird or unusual that you love actually has a really good answer which I actually do the same thing. Going to tell you what it is yet. You have to listen to the end to get that but I suspect its more common than we both or then she realized I think it's actually probably more common in the general population. So listen and let me know how you go with that one. Enjoy the episode. Okay, I'm joined today by just for Dwight from right at home staging. How are you going? Yes, I'm good. Thank you Jake. How are you? Very well, welcome to the show.	1.0

But or that's how they feel and I just think that people are using food as a reinforcer when it like something they need to work for where it should be something that they have.	1.0

That's our first set of kettlebells the orange the blue one and the bigger the big Catalyst. Okay and your kids doing these classes once a week for yeah, okay, and when the idea of opening a box well	1.0
Well, it's like, you know, we did that thing though.	1.0
I wouldn't say necessarily outperform but the consistent mayor's brain trays you fucker they raised in something, you know, and yes, I have I have some errors that yeah, they're there. I'll give you an example. I had a little old mare 124 her name is classy cat. And so that married be like how she be 18 now, but every cult we've got out of her box there and like to some degree like whether it's shining really in a far potential or dis good, you know, and and in fact, I don't think I have one that's went to the NFR yet, but I got a couple cold. That sure look like they're suspects it just matter of whether they stay healthy and and continue on what they're doing. But but she was probably only I'm in today's world. I would say she'd struggle to be an 18-point her. She was just a hopper. She had cool a cool style. She just wasn't that shiny, you know, and but her cult certainly outperform her that's that's for sure. But at the same time You know, she wasn't very big or was it still have her so she isn't very big and and and just not very talented. You know, it's sort of like a like a football player, you know, if you're not that big and strong it's pretty hard to be very good at it. Yeah, but but he cried but big doesn't doesn't things with her and she's yeah those coats are showing up pretty good, you know, so so in 2005 kind of when you took over the whole deal what What was the stud that you put out and how how to his cult perform? Well the first the first year so okay, so I bought the horses in the fall of o5. And so the actually the mayor's were already bread. So I didn't really make a stud decision until the spring of o6. The spring of o6. I went and I leased a stud and I am so thankful. For that now I went back and I kind of I was kind of a little bit rough earlier when we were talking about how that some of the old-timers are and when I say Old Timers, I mean the the established bucking horse programs. They didn't they weren't really willing to share intellectual property with you and they were pretty pretty quiet and tight-lipped about what they were doing. Well, I was very lucky. I become friends with with the Sankey family and in the spring of oh sick. Exile East a stud from Ike and his name was star belly sneech and so star start at least it was just kind of okay, but he wasn't that good of a boxer himself, but he is Mom was Cindy Lou Who and Cindy Lou Who who was among a really famous mayor. I had that went to the NFR bunch of times and she was a daughter of Custer, huh? I believe I don't have a pedigree chart in front of me, but is if I may Serves me correct correctly Cindy Lou was a it was an own daughter a Custer and and then that sire to Star belly sneech was a stud of cork owes name confused velvet and he was and he was a really good sire. Like they had a lot of luck with that horse. And so anyway, I took start releasing each and brought him to the mayor's like I told you guys earlier that I thought were the best. You know of what we when I had bought from from them guys and when you say that you mean like the best as far as bucking horses are the best that you thought would be the best broodmare type forces. Well a little of both right? So what's the one thing that I did also a little bit different when I first started I knew I was behind the 8-ball little bit and all five or o6 when I first put this done out with the mirror. I know I was behind me. ball as far as in terms of I told you guys earlier that the breeding program that that I bought, you know wasn't real organized completely mined out on what what matters were produced and what stuff for the what and got out of it was just kind of just a bunch of horses really and so what I did is started, you know, but, you know, obviously with bucks who we had all our old mares and boxes and stuff, but then I went to bucking some young mares and and doing some stuff that way and then I started breeding some young mares like some three and four-year-old Billy's to to try and get ahead of the curve and it wasn't that I wanted to turn those those fillies in the broodmares at all. That wasn't my intent. It was just to get a cult out of him to get to get ahead of the game a little bit and and and and I use you know, a couple things, you know to decide number one was obviously Secondly was was the you know the pedigree of the mayor but but again, like I told you that wasn't completely organized. So it was kind of kind of kind of sorts to navigate through that but then the other thing was confirmation, you know, I talked a little bit ago about classic at one of the one her problems was why she couldn't Buck any harder or be any better than she was just for confirmation. She was too small and built a little bit wrong. To be to be really rank, you know are really good. So, you know, you can almost look at a horse and see what how is Styles going to work? You know, how he's going to block? You know, a good example is Butler's you know, Benny Butler you guys are familiar with that and I'm sure everybody knows Benny Butler Rodeo business. Well, they're there the way their horses are bit built their big kind of lanky kind of raw. Bone horse. And they got usually a highway others, you know, and they're they're just built to where you know, they're going to be dropping they're going to Buck hard and they're gonna be dropping and they're athletic they're really built that way and and so that and so in terms or in turn built any does have a lot of stronger horses that will turkana guy and Buck Em Off. Yeah, I mean and but they also can be 90 on them, but they're just they're built that way then on the flip side of that you can go and look at Like Kirby's heard in Utah the Kirby family their horses are a little bit smaller not as high withered little more kind of I don't want to sound say I'm wrong because I don't want to be like I'm down on them because they're awesome horses. They're just kind of like a little fat horses, you know and very little and so because of that because I have some of them to they Hawk they're really the guys because they're little bit. They're not as They're not built to be strong.

I mean there's still a lot of people out there, but I just wonder how many are still. attached to it enough where they're like, okay, I mean, this is obviously a marketing thing where locate their they're releasing it so that they can get their people back but I'm wondering other than the people who have already bought it other than the people who have already been enjoying Battlefield 5 who really wants to get Battlefield 5, it's just for the Battle Royale because I've been I've been preaching it from the heavens that like Pub G like I could technically play that now I could go on my PlayStation I could Pay the money to buy our to purchase it or exactly download it but then I have to pee I have to pay money. It's like right now I have H1Z1 which is very similar. I know there's going to be tons of people out there who want to be like well actually but H1Z1 very similar you have realm Royale, which is nice. I didn't absolutely love it, but I liked it you have Fortnight and now you have Apex. Why in God's name would I spend money on pube G? Just play something that I'm really already playing in a better version and I know like like well, how do you know you've never played it? But I know I know. Yeah, you just know in your heart.	0.0

Okay. So let's talk about the first one. If you want to follow along with us, then pause the podcast and watch the two episodes and then come back and you can comment or let us know what you think about the episodes if we Didn't say something that you want to put out there anyways, so this episode opens with a concert which some of the episodes of Hannah Montana do. I don't know why a lot of the earlier ones. I filled it and I just it's confusing because that it opens with a concert and then I don't know it's like when was it filmed where was it filmed it because it seems like a legit concert, but it's not like in a studio like this a ton of people in the audience. What do you mean? It's not a studio? It doesn't look like a studio film space, you know, like okay, so, you know how like the difference between like for example the set at Rico's and then watching episode of like and emac like the the set is different. Like it looks like a legitimate set it like just like, you know what I mean? Yeah. Anyway, so I feel like the the concert at the beginning that's episode look like a real concert hall and that like a sound stage somewhere and a lot or whatever you think that you don't think are you saying?	0.0

I don't accept this Marie. Where are you Lorraine? I actually really did enjoy the episode. I actually thought it was a great Challenge and I will admit when they do great things. I thought it was a great. Challenge because it is something that drag queens have to do maybe not from start to finish creating the whole event, but I have a lot. Yeah, I have a lot to say later, but that's all I'll say right now and everyone who's joining us in the chat room.	1.0

So by the end of the episode that he decides he's going to go to Stonewall good.	0.0
So the two the three names actually that caught my attention. We're Darius Slayton Connor McGovern and then there was another receiver in their mouths Boykin. Excuse me. So both Boykin and Slayton are guys that have Packers I can guarantee you're going to be in love with they blow the thresholds out of the water. I'm looking at the position though, and it's starting to get a little log jammed with a selection of Depot Samuel. Connor McGovern is a guy that I would be looking at in this area and this part of the draft solid solid player, you know, he's a little bit developmental but that's what you're getting in the fourth round. I think that's exactly what they're looking for in their lineman right now. Not only that he fits what they're looking fits their thresholds with the four five seven short shuttle and a 7-6 6-3 cone. Obviously, he fits the size. So I think Connor McGovern is the selection for me here Joel Marino talked about his ability to play in a Zone. Out and also has some lateral Mobility. So I think he fits with the Packers going to try and do in the Run game very well and then you can try and teach him to coach him up. I should say in the passing game. And so I think that Connor McGovern is the selection for me here.	1.0
So to speak and just really clear away that clutter don't store things around the edges of your Out and that's kind of a weak area for me. I think in the master bedroom, you know, I would never do that in the living room.	0.0

Like like you are now so when that couple start I'm 37 now and but I started biting I guess around 24 24 23 something like that. And it was just too I went to the gym instructor said he's doing a program for me it is like how far can you run on the treadmill my other brother and I didn't I didn't run and so well, so I just Start a street lights and street lights doll and it all went downhill from there. Basically first it was to lose weight and then, you know just loved it more than I did my first 5k first 12K, then my first half marathon which in I was living in Darwin at the time and I just I'll never forget that feeling a finish my first half marathon. It was just like I never in my dreams thought I'd be able to do that, but someone like me to do a half marathon. Um, yeah, it was a wonderful feeling and then you just keep pushing the envelope that bit further you people thinking maybe I could try doing this and that's just that's just how it happened to I've had some time off here and there in the past. I've got had been injured and when I was pregnant and after I had my daughter I had some time off but you're just the past maybe four years. I've really really got back into it.	1.0
It was funny but unnecessary the thing about yeah, I okay. So the thing about this is that I thought that the idea of it was funny and that the outfits that they put on the spot on and like, I don't know I thought that was well done.

I'm not sure. I've always thought for a very very long time that actually we have three options right from the current situation. We added also 20 years ago. Either we allow the government is no longer into beings doesn't try to bail out anybody and so on then we get a crisis and then we get actually a deflationary melt all of the whole system. As the first option the second option is you're just trying to inflate your way out of this and of course that's not really a solution but it will just Frank we will just wrecked the economy because you're the sooner or later you're getting very fast into hyperinflation. And the third option is and of very often is neglected. The third option is just to layer more and more regulations of the economy to it's late. But at the same time to eventually sort of Regulation to try to prevent that deflationary policies leads to higher prices leads to Greater redistribution and so on and so you're walking your way into a completely regulated into effect into a totalitarian socialist. And right now I think we're moving on a path of this way of this world now, that's that's a very I'm sorry. It is not very very very positive and in a bright Outlook, but I mean, we definitely need to take this into consideration. I mean, we cannot honestly all of the present situation is very fragile. So we all know so it's very unstable and cannot we cannot remain there. So where will be moving I think they But people who are running monetary policy or running the state the main objective is to stay at the helm a to keep running the country handed over to their friends when they they self themselves as step aside. So they will not consider the deflation or a mountain solution. They want to avoid hyperinflation. So the for them the way to go is more inflation and at the same time Again, I'm a greater control or the economy size. So I was yeah, if you think of something like the plunge protection T to they exist. Yeah, I mean, I mean the central bank doesn't call it the plunge for taxing to you. This is the jargon. Yeah.

So late as a good visual the show like like let's say a quarter mil in a vial of powder of heroin could be a weird lethal dose and then it showed a vial of Fentanyl and it was only a couple of specs like candy or something - well, there's like one or two little specks in it. So it just goes to show you the volume of how much stronger is because people always here at stake. It's a hundred times stronger than morphine is hundred strong kind of the Fentanyl and then car fennel is another a hundred times stronger, right?	0.0
So I actually posted recently on my Instagram a picture and it was just like a picture of me and just like very open. So personally, I was always very shy and I never really wanted to try new things and I was very close and Just in general I would I like to be in my bubble and ever and ever like to try anything new. So she was always trying to get me to do different shows and whatnot. And then she always said to me trust the process. This is something that since I was a little kid she was just telling me non-stop if I always doubted my like if I doubted myself or whatever it was she said trust the process everything happens for a reason if your I remember just like losing one competition. We were like next in the final or something like that and I remember coming out of that cup. Shouldn't and I was just so sad. I was like, oh my God, whatever I'm doing. It's just not happening. It's I don't know. What like what what else could I possibly do to be in that final and this that and the other and she's like trust the process. It happened for a reason and it definitely did because I remember the next competition. I was so hungry for it and I wasn't I was just trying to do I wasn't trying to compete with anybody else. I was really just competing with myself and trying to improve myself more and I remember that petition ended up in the final and doing really well. So like things like that. She always let me know that everything happened for a reason and if something didn't happen it's meant to be that way and funny enough about two years ago. We tried out for Dancing With the Stars. Oh you did and we didn't get it and I was like all this you know, this is something I really want. I've I've always watched the show and I'm like super big fan and it's something I've always wanted to do. When we got the call that we weren't going to be on it. I was actually really sad and I was talking to her about it and she's like then it wasn't your time. It's right just continue doing what you're doing. And that's actually when we went on World of Dance. Oh, yeah, we want door closes exactly how the door open and that year. We actually tried out we auditioned for World of Dance. We got onto World of Dance and we kept competing. We kept perfecting our technique and and then when we did get the call for this year's Dancing with the Stars real	1.0

But yeah, but um, these two girls are you know, like I have no hatred for them at all. It just breaks my heart that there for me still. So giving a lot of toxic information that has been very destructive for me. And the people that I know and love. Yeah, and I just think they're too young and inexperienced and they don't have enough like a wide enough grasp of the world to actually speak to those topics at the top of their intelligence because you know, you're not supposed to question. You also brought up before like we are taught to fear our emotions they always use the Verse, that's like the heart is deceitful.	0.0
Which one is it?	1.0
So you say something funny and then it beeps? He says something funny on command. We're testing it out fucking will be. So today mean Isabelle going to be talking about depression Isabel's my cyst and we both have depression. So that's why we're talking about it today both think we can offer some advice and just share our experiences with it. A lot of people say that they have depression when they don't and they're just sad so there's like a difference between being depressed and just sad so I'm going to read the DSM-5 criteria, so It says the individual must be experiencing 5 or more of these symptoms during a two-week period and they are depressed mood most of the day nearly everyday markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement that eager loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day recurrent thoughts of death recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. Rude, yeah, rude, they are so rude. That is so rude. Yeah. Hit me where it hurts the most. Yeah. Yeah, so When did you kind of realize like you have that like, oh shit moment. Like I have depression it was with you. Actually we were in we're going to see our dad and Florida and you're just hanging out on the beach and I said, I was 12 I said hey. Even when you get in the car, do you sometimes like like not want to put your seatbelt on just like if you get in a car accident, so you'll die in the not have to wake up and you said no. Nope, I don't remember that at all. Wow. Yeah, so I realized that no one else around you want to get hit by a bus. Yeah, and like everyone has different like Degrees of depression so when I say have depression, I mean very recently after our father passed away. I got depressed but I wouldn't say like I've clinical depression all the time. Mmm. It was a very depressed period of my life. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself depressed. But as you would, you know, well, that's a big difference to like there's a normal scale of like grief that people experience but mine was passed that they're like, there's no right way to grieve. Yeah. But I think my grief turned into severe depression because it lasted for like a year and it became well, that's when it persists. It's that's what it's different. Yeah, but it was far too hard DSM-5. Yes, but it was triggered by something. So whereas yours was just like always kind of present your whole life. Yeah. I can look back and be like, yeah like yeah, we saw that I would always say like and as well as also bipolar Sorry by pulling impressive. Yeah. Yeah, so but I remember thinking when I was six like there's a good Isabel on a bad Isabel and we pretend that she had an evil twin named Bethany. Oh, yeah, let's Bethenny. Yeah. And so whenever like we'd be eating at the dinner table, Bethany would be looking at me with like these dagger eyes and I feel like I can't tell my mom the Bethany's here. Like I have to pretend it's Isabelle like yeah, I get so nervous. Like Bethenny would be in the card. Like I remember just being terrified of When Bethenny came out no one was having a good day. Yeah savagery. Yeah, it was savagery. But I think one thing people don't realize about depression is how much of your life that you miss out on and just completely blank on like Olivia has this whole memory. I don't have any memory of it at all. I didn't remember Bethany until she just said Bethenny right now and like I'm assuming that's the right name, but I don't Bethenny, but I don't have a memory of it. We would do it at summer camp to to like freak out the kids out. Hmm. So and I was so used to it. It was so normal for me. Yeah, but other people I'm sure thought we were like crazy. Yeah. Is the point I'm trying to make is that depression can take away periods of your life with leaving you with no memory almost like holes and associating kind of not associating you look back and you don't remember anything. Yeah, like literally have memories that people have your brain is empty. Yeah. That's very sad. Emptiness is a good word. I think but it really do be like that. So I really do be like that it really do. I think this is like so after my dad died, I remember one day I was going on a run and I usually love to run but this run was hard and then all of a sudden I just started like sobbing. And like it hit me like then that I wanted to kill myself and like that's what I all I could think about the whole run was how is going to kill myself when I got home? No when I got home, but like in the future like when I was going to do it all this stuff and I just told my mom right away. I was just like this is very abnormal for me. Like I got put on an antidepressant and it helped immediately almost But that was a phase of my life where if I am afraid to go off my antidepressants because like what if I do have depression now mmm, you know, and it's just the medicine just works. So well, you know and it's not like that for everyone that comes so lucky that like it was a period, you know, definitely Well medicine is hard because it it only works just to such an extent where you kind of had to put in the work to you know what I mean? Like it'll give you the tool in your toolbox exact. It's not the whole box. Yeah, definitely. So on top of it to the Press since it doesn't mean you can just take a pill like go about your day. You actually have to actively like tell your brain. Hey, dude, shut the fuck up. Yeah, you'll lot of things you don't need. Kill yourself you genuinely don't ya and sometimes it's like reminding yourself like all the good things you have which sounds really cheesy but that's actually helped me a lot just sitting on my bedroom floor. I'm being present and being great. Yeah and like Isabel like it's so good. Like she'll go outside with her crystals and like charger crystals and do some like stretching like she didn't need to do that before she does things for herself now, like go to like comedy nights and stuff, which I think is really awesome. And she's definitely like has come a long way. It's all comes down. Down to just being kind to yourself. You can't be angry at yourself for not making progress every single day. You're not going to make progress every single day might regress. Yeah, you're going to live with it for your whole life. So you have to be kind to yourself about it and you have to reassure yourself. Like you're not always going to be in this mood and just kind of today not every day is going to be exactly and just keep encouraging yourself and being nice to yourself and the nicer you already yourself the more that like guilt that comes with depression will go away. I think that's kind of also how I knew that I had depression was because I had All this guilt for know that's a big part of it. Yeah, and I was just like there was a point where I was like calling people and saying sorry for things that I didn't even need to say sorry for her because I just couldn't fathom why I was feeling so bad about myself. Yeah. That was like I did something wrong, you know, like these people hate me and I think that's another thing with depression is like it really is storts your view about you're like purpose and your place on this earth like you really do think no one loves you sometime so definitely, but you're not lovable, you know. Mmm. or that it would be better off or you wouldn't be affected and like something that I've had a hard time with is just like I always tell myself now like most things aren't the end of the world. Which is a good thing, but also like the world's going to keep going, you know, yeah, definitely and I think that's a thing that people with depression is just like why am I here? Like, they're very smart people that are depressed. Oh, yeah, definitely have a lot like most people have a higher IQ if they're depressed because they just are so aware of everything that's like going on in the dusty. It's not like when everything is thriving in the world depression rates go up like it's directly correlated with kind of the state of things. Yeah, because people Like we're affected by each other quietly gently genuinely are affected by each other. If you're having a bad day. I I consider myself an empath. I don't have a good day either, you know, like if people that I really love like our are sad like, I can't be happy. Yeah are genuinely happy. For me, I just think it's like I think a lot of the problem is like depression in this first world country when you have all these Comforts is like I literally have no reason to be depressed right now that makes it worse and it makes you make yourself feel guilty. Did you just sit on it? The guilt? The guilt is a really interesting thing. Like I remember being like Five and like putting away like my first tour was ever was like putting away dishes in the dishwasher and there were like big forks and little forks. And I was like, I don't want to separate the little forks from the big Force because like the baby force them on me for seem to be together and I felt like I was like the worst human ever for doing that. You know what I mean? Like I always even then I always needed to have a reason for why I was guilty. Yeah, I would I just felt guilty because I was always so angry. Yeah. Like anger is a secondary emotion, you know? Yeah, definitely. Another thing about being this angry in this cute. Is that when you get angry everyone around you goes? No, you just make me like five to give or take an inch. Yeah, so normally takes us seriously. Yeah, definitely. People laugh when I get mad. Oh, yeah. That's how I know like, okay well, but they're like all that chipmunks having a bad day. I know. Oh, yeah. I feel like there's a lot of stories. I have that about depression that like a lot of things where I'm just like normal quote-unquote like morals neurotypical people just like wouldn't think this way mmm, you know, but like what are some like misconceptions you think about depression that That don't have it. Kind of like Get wrong. I just think the number one thing is that People aren't kind enough to people with depression. They're not patient enough and they expect too much. So they don't view it as something that's seriously chemicals are incorrect in your brain that affects you every day. That is almost like a physical weight on you every day when you wake up. That's not what they do it as they just say like they think you can snap out of it, especially if you're high functioning especially for high functioning like I go to work every single day. I work six days a week and every day someone tells me you like you make my day all the time. You always make me smile, you know, because I'm such a high-functioning depressive and the other day. I said, you know, I am really struggling right now think I got to go see a new therapist or something and there's this almost they said, oh you have depression and I said, yeah and they said I would have never guessed the yeah you had depression because the way you carry yourself. Yeah, it's just but that tape but they don't understand how much effort that takes out of someone. And almost when people tell me that sometimes I'm like, thank you honestly, but also like doesn't have a look. It doesn't have a not always. Yeah, it does sometimes like oh you can't like look at somebody like they're having a bad day. But like eyes exactly why I think it's important to talk about it because you wouldn't expect certain people you wouldn't expect to be depressed and they jammed the happiest people like yeah are depressed like Robin Williams, for example, he was very very depressed and he was always making people laugh. He said something really good about depression, which I think like we need to hear it out. It was like it was something along the lines of yes depression is a crippling illness that is not 100% Like people aren't 100% in control of but I also do believe that if you are not thinking the right things actively eating the right things actively hoping actively loving yourself actively. Then you are not giving yourself a Fighting Chance. That's so true. You cannot just give yourself with who? There was a point at school and I think I tend to get more depressed when I'm stressed and it is depression because like there was a point where I could not get out of my bed for eight days. Yeah. It did not leave my apartment for eight days and all I ate was Oreos. Yeah, and that just perpetuated the cycle. Like if I had healthy food, you know, I probably would have just been invented my like right mind but I literally as well knew I was calling her like crying. I'm like, I was depressed like it was hard. Yeah, and it's hard for me because like we were saying earlier like Olivia wasn't always. This way it was always me so then me seeing the way that I've always been on Libya someone who always be this happy. It was really hard. It was really see ya because a lot of people give me that way too and I wasn't fake either. It was very genuine. So after my dad died, I went on antipsychotics just because I was I needed to be stabilized because I wasn't doing well. I had a lot of PTSD. Yeah, and I didn't laugh for four months and it was the scariest thing because I felt like I couldn't Make emotions. Yeah, I didn't have emotions and it was Yep, jarring yet and that's why when my I feel like my my mood is kind of getting getting really bad. I don't immediately jump the gun and say, okay, let's medicate. I kind of step back and wait it out and be patient with myself and be kind to myself. You can look hopeful for towards the future and then you'll find so much better like think about how you coped back then even versus now like definitely changing holes in walls now you don't do that anymore. Yeah. I know. I'm 90. I can still punch a good hole in the wall. Yeah, I don't do that anymore. Yeah, I just go to hardcore shows. Yeah, we're it so punch other people. Where's okay to hit people. Yeah, they wanted they literally want it. Yeah, it's gonna pay for it. And another thing with depression finding those Outlets that you can be that place where you can see angry at. Yeah, there's always some anger like late and anger. You never really know about. Yeah, but that that bitching third grade Duty told if you're angry that I farted. Yeah when it was her, yeah. Yeah, that would make me angry still. Yeah. Yeah, but like I'm not saying you need to go but all your friends go to all your friends talk about how sad or angry you are, but I personally like my best friend. We love ranting to each other above pick things that make us angry to friend you leave that person to we're not each other's therapist, but it sounds fuck I fighting to fucking go off. You know what I mean? Like she's there to listen and she thinks it's funny. You know what I yeah, like again when I'm small but I'm angry like Funny regardless, yeah, so having that person that you guys kind of both enjoy and you feed off each others, like fuck this and you kind of just get that out for today Twitter was invented. That's why Twitter was invented. Yeah, honestly, like it's so good for like my depression because I'm just psyched about Twitter. Yeah. I heard about Twitter. My favorite thing about Twitter is when the mainstream media goes Okay, we're going to put together this story. For example Epstein yet committed suicide. Hope it works. They sends it out immediately Twitter. Oh how motherfucking convenient a billionaire with tons of dirt commit suicide. So K and it just immediately air quotes immediately on Twitter everyone blew up and was like, yeah. No and that's why I love Twitter. I love Twitter and it's a conglomerate a fucking Pete. I love those like memes that go viral. It's just like my depression my eating disorder my anxiety like all meeting up and it's like all those people doing the damn. Yeah, I love that like then it yeah, I mean, I think another another misconception that depressed people or mentally ill people have is mentally ill people have is that they're in this alone like no one understands what they're going through. That's not the fucking case. There are literally millions of people that feel actually exactly the way that you do and I'm sure neither of you can describe that feeling because it's okay and that's why No one thinks that anyone feels like them. Yes, but you have to communicate and be like no dude. I feel big sad sometimes to fix a big sad and that's okay. You know, I think another moment where I realized I had depression was where I was like laying down in bed with my friend and he was trying to tell me that like there was like more to life than like than what I was seeing and he was like people love you like your friends just all came over and you like made them all breakfast and like all the stuff and I was like, no one loves me like yeah, I'm like unlovable and I was crying and I didn't want anyone like like nothing anyone said could change the fact that I thought no one loved me. Yeah. Yep, or did I was like, there's nothing you can say and he was just like so sad like he was crying. Yeah, and I was like, why are you upset and he was like cuz I care about you and I was like, I don't know what yeah. Yeah, but once one time when I realized I was not in a good spot was when you my boyfriend, we're going to Chick-fil-A and big complex of just like people going and shopping and shit and there was like a really happy family of like a mom and a dad. Three kids. They're all like gigglin the kid was holding the mom's hand. I just gestured out the window and loudly said I don't want to see that. Really? Yeah, and then there was like Isabel, that's a perfectly Pleasant situation.	0.0
Yeah, we met at a party and it was one of those it was just one of those, you know. Oh, they one of those fairy tale moments. They write about in the movies. Like I'm in the party. She's in there. I see her across the room and the whole room disappeared and let me guess kissing you started playing now. I'm okay, but real talk like the whole room disappeared and I'm just staring at her and got caught her eye. She staring at me and I was kind of you know, shy so we kind of both shuffled and kind of made like a Mid-ground like I'm not going to your sides. You're not going to my side and then I think I just walked past and I just like your eyes are beautiful and she was like, so are yours and then that was it? Okay. I got the number. It's when you had the right down and oh you got a pen. Yep, you know what? I mean got the number and then hit us. I've known her since I was 18.	1.0
So there's that picture you were you felt like yeah. I used to put in like middle. You're not around my boobs directly under like a support system. Are you I just wanted to talk about that.	1.0
That's totally intuitive. And and again, it's like you didn't even mentally understand why you were craving watermelon at the time but there's this inherent wisdom that your body has to know what it needs especially in a in a situation where there's something out of balance. So, you know, it's ironic because diet culture the system are like the system that exists that really promotes dieting as the way to health really demonizes cravings and tells us that our Cravings are something to it. Nor or that, you know, we need to fight or overcome our Cravings but in your case layout like you're craving was telling you the exact thing that you really needed and that was going to really benefit your body. So you listening to that and you giving your body what it needed was the best thing you could do for yourself at that time and probably had a really positive impact on your blood circulation at the time.	1.0

Yeah, and I mean, I it's not like I reached out to say hey, like what do you think about this offer? Because I would not you know take that seriously, but someone had texted me and had that response and I was like, I can't not share this because Twitter was going crazy people were believing this guy for some reason and so we put that to bed. Well Oliver. Well, I want to see the one thing that didn't dawn on. till now that would have you know, I never needed to panic because I scheduled a really early morning flight back and with the stopped at Chicago because I assumed that's the flight that the Indians front office Executives would take turns out they took a later flight closer to lunchtime. So they were in the air when all that was going down and when you had texted me and so I don't know why I panicked because I think they're means would have been pretty limited engaged in quote unquote serious talks as aunt.	1.0

Right and that's how he's going to show them and so Reggie doesn't same thing with the baseball bat to his dad's prized car and then we just cut to later where it's are cheating with Richie.

I wish I could remember I think he went I know he went a couple three times anyway in a bareback riding and then it only went twice in a bronx and the first year he went in the Bronx actually feeling Crawley one second and on him in The Eliminator pin that he wanted second that one round that one night and then then he went last this last night and 18, but he went and teen again, but then it came out that and was Zeke's arson and I think of zika gone anyway, and I didn't even got in flank and they jumped off I think and got to reroute a river. But but he so it came out backwards. And so it was kind of a mess that you're in 17 and then they didn't he didn't go back and this year and 18. He still box really? Well, I'm not I'm I'm not trying to say that, you know, like he's killed us really really hard. He just didn't go last year in you guys know how that goes some years. They need they need more of one kind and another and you know, this is how it goes. He just didn't get chosen last year, but he still as good as he was these this these people I'm going to mention here their long ways from you, but you probably you may you may know this the answer to what I'm going to say to correct me but to go with what you're saying Thor and some good friends of mine that live over there by you the the gays that horse is salt. They he went to the finals of bunching in the bareback riding and I'd never seen him in the bronc Ridin till this year. Did he go in the bronc riding him this year to the final? You know II could look but I don't recall seeing assault there, but I know him he's that Buckskin gilding. You're like, he's a good horse. Yeah, I don't know I could you know what I can look real quick cuz I think I have the NFR left right here in the go in the old. I remember seeing them. They took him to I think it was luck in in in the Bronx grab your maybe Amarillo and I was I had to watch that video a couple of times thinking is that the Assault that I think it is. Yeah, yeah, and and and and he's probably the same the same. Same scenario as I was talking about with Capone, you know, he's been a good bear back for a long time. But if they start covering a little ground and stuff.	0.0

In their natural everyday life totally like how off you know, it's so normalized like how often do you hear people say I need to burn this off or I need to like work out so that I can go to brunch even here in like Fitness classes. A lot of Fitness instructors will use terms like, you know burn it to earn it and it's just like do you say something L. I actually do because I obviously am very strongly opinionated about this and it's really harmful because not everybody is there to like learn Our food and why can't we just enjoy moving our bodies without feeling like we need to compensate for food? It's like I don't ever have to think about needing to compensate so that I can take a breath or like use oxygen which is another just physiological need but why is there all of this language around food as if it's something we need to earn when it's like your body just requires food and you don't need to earn or compensate for your food and anyway, and that mentality is what's so damaging not even really the the food itself.

I mean, it's fantastic like I would recommend that to anyone back home like if you've got got An injury respond respond to it straight away. But at the same time how do you know what's an injury like often? We've all got Nichols as Runners and if we get to to responsive to niggles, then we wouldn't run. Yeah.

Well, I mean I started thinking about gold from one entry point of view and of course gold would be much better money then feared money that we use today, but I've come to the conclusion that as many other people before the gold is not actually the best man at their Probably something the best money would be something like silver. So I think precious metals probably the best choice. So I'm not a Bitcoin Advocate and so on and like experiments like Bitcoin because they're free market experiences is a great deal of thinking that goes into this great creativity and what I like about it as a professor is that it gets people to think about economic mechanisms or the economic Concepts and so on. So this is all great about Bitcoin, but still don't think that Bitcoin will be good money. So I think the traditional monies that we had in the past gold silver still the best one. Sorry.	0.0

Well a lot of People kind of say like, oh you just threw the baby out with the bathwater like you jumped from Christian to atheism and that wasn't the case at all. I actually still believed in God for probably two years after I stop calling myself a Christian and I just had this feeling of like organized religion put God in a box and like it forced us to have these certain stories that were culturally specific and that didn't, you know, go over like to other countries. Or whatever and I just remember having this like since the freedom where it's like I could go to any country and experience like what they consider like profound spirituality and I could apply that to my life without feeling like, you know, it's not accurate and and I just remember thinking like all these religions throughout the entire world have claimed to have spiritual experiences. They've To have these miracles happen and I just I didn't like thinking like they were wrong and I'm right and like my specific story is like the one true truth and like shedding to that story itself allowed me to view like God in a much more like open way that I found super inclusive and inviting and more cohesive. And you know, I still actually hold a lot of those values. Like I want I think I'm still slightly bitter when it comes to organized religion, but I definitely want to get to the point where I can go, you know to other countries and experience, you know, their religion and their culture and everything that comes with that and just, you know, apply that to my life and you know become a better person based off of these were	0.0

You know, I think that Doing things at an extreme measure like trying to do everything all at once can be paralyzing. Let's say like it's decision paralysis when you tell somebody I want you to do an hour of cardio a day. I want you to count your calories. I want you have this much water. I want you to sleep this wedge apple cider vinegar. I want you to have 30 25 to 35 grams of fiber at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you throw too much shot them they kind of get like get stuck it in there. Yeah, so I try to give them a smart goals something that's specific something that's measurable. All something that's realistic attainable the timely and example of a smart goal is I want you to lose four pounds in four weeks. I want you to track your water intake. I want you to track your way and every single day and then at the end of each week take the average of your weight and the compared to the next and to the next so it's like once I hear yeah, you're not you're not looking day-to-day measurements. You're looking at weekly measurements and on average. So you get a general idea of where your weight is. Actually that's kind of like stocks, you know goes up it goes down. But where is the general Trend going, you know? A lot of fluctuations that people have our water weight fluctuations. You have salt you have sugar you have alcohol you have menstruation. You have stress. You have sleep. You have so many things fiber that affect your water weight at that particular point. So it's important to take your weigh-ins average them out compared to the next week. So you get a general idea. Am I really losing weight and my maintaining what's the rate at my loser? Because you can lose the to 3 pounds a day go in the sauna cut your car. Yeah, you know eat clean and that's just a lot of water weight. Illusion, but if you're talking about fat loss fat loss takes time. Yeah about 1 pound per week. Gotcha.	0.0

So today we're going to talk about a subject the subject of kindness we I know that you know as teachers we are hopefully modeling kindness and our classroom kindness on the playground kindless with our peers kindness with their peers because the students the students are looking at you they're noticing you they're watching you and so I was reading an article the other day and found not an unsurprising but it's still a little bit of alarming statistics about what teachers are seeing in their classroom teachers are reporting about a 30% increase in bullying or unkind Behavior being displayed over the last couple of years. It's not surprising but it's still alarming. I think it's not surprising because we are seeing more bullying type of behavior or unkind Behavior through different types of social media channels the way people interact with each other and so students are noticing children are noticing what they're seeing and it's coming back into our classroom. So I thought today would be a great time to talk about kind. This how we how do we Foster kindness in her classroom? And Adam is first of all, one of the kindest people. I know I'm not just saying that because he's staring at me like I totally feel that way and if you've met him before I know that you agree, but he also does some really specific things in his classroom to help Foster that kindness and so I thought maybe Adam you could speak to that.	1.0

I'm like, I wonder who wrote this for a morbius. Okay. He said yeah, it doesn't look very good. But I was curious who wrote it and I went to it and found out that the writer also did the kings of Egypt so I'm pretty sure my feelings about that movie or Justified. I love that movie but is so dumb anyway, so okay in terms of a plan. Yeah. I didn't have one and immediately but as I got a little bit older and start to realize as I started getting to the age where I needed to have a plan being you know, 17 18 years old. I am I going to college am I what am I doing? I like I had I had come to the decision that I wanted to go to film school. But at the same time like I didn't really feel comfortable like trying to ask my parents to help pay to send me to art school. I'm not it for when I'm not even sure that they would have liked agreed to that. You know, I think my dad's a pretty practical person. You probably have been like like well if you're gonna go to you know School Going to pay for it. We want to make sure it's something we can get a return on the investment for which makes sense. But my parents are also very they've always been very supportive of all the creative things I wanted to do when I was a place to play guitar might like my dad. He'll buy me like this. Nice big Marshall Half Stack and let you know it's always very supportive of this stuff. So that's just conjecture on my part. Is that how he would have felt about it?

Well, it marked the end of the band Pink Floyd incredibly contemporary. It sounds just as good now as what it did back then wish you were here the 9th album from Pink Floyd according to Roger Waters Mark the end of the band. However, another one was to come of course namely the wall a beautiful Masterpiece as well. But on this occasion, it's wish you were here and there's a good reason for it. This particular album was when Roger Waters set himself up to be solely the bandleader dismissing a lot of Dave Gilmore's incursions Nick Mason's as well as Richard Wright. It was at the time a real Roger Waters trademark, and that's what Pink Floyd was fast becoming Dave Gilmore's vocals on wish you were here. I think arguably sizes up the salty sweet. Nation of what was the relationship between waters and Gilmour the way that he sung it there's a debate whether or not wish you were here is actually one of the highest performing songs by buskers and artists alike a favorite performed on acoustic guitar. If you go to any Pub on a Sunday afternoon, it's likely that you hear the song performed some better than others. How could a slow song such as wish you were here? How could Contemporary ballad if you like become such a pillar of the face of rock and roll well meaning the whole meaning not just the way it's written what was written but how it was performed how it was sung. There's a distinctive note a pairing and it certainly comes across on this album. And on the track when Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd was released. It went straight to the top of the It's on both sides of the Atlantic. It's sold over 14 million copies just within 12 months. I mean this was going to be a smash no matter what the album itself has. The cover has a man in flames and the other one shaking his hand as you know back then it was actually done. He actually lit himself on fire and shook the guy's hand and then they had to extinguish him. But get this they couldn't do it. Just once they had to do it a few times to get the the right shot. It's just something that was needed at the time. And this was Artistry going in a New Direction actual photographs of people doing this kind of thing. It was a Telltale sign of the stories to follow especially with the wall. That was forthcoming Richard Wright of Pink Floyd later said that this was without a doubt his favorite album. Actually. It's a lot of people's favorite album for many reasons the songs on it are immeasurable just beautiful tracks back to back so So enjoy it if you haven't heard it and if you do have it just pick up that volume turned up to ten on a Saturday night, you know do what you need to do to feel the way that you do and enjoy one of the finest albums and one of the world's best rock albums ever met. Well, that's it for today's show was almost perfect. Wasn't it? You know bearing the 30 or 40 remarkably obvious mistakes.	1.0

So just like Italy underwater I don't I don't ever want to just order the water. No, I think that as soon as you bring in that number or that like external measurement of a food it inhibits your ability to actually check in with yourself and ask yourself what you feel like eating SO trading the rules about what you should be eating what you think would be a good choice and actually just start to feel into what you're craving what you feel like eating and instead of thinking about you know, how healthy this. All is or what? The calorie content is ask yourself. How do I want to feel after eating this or what value do I want to honor right now with this food decision. So really just starting to bring it to a more internal place that you're deciding for yourself what you want to eat instead of allowing some externalized message or voice tell you what you should order the next thing I would recommend for somebody who wants to start intuitive eating which is something you can do today. Is to start to get curious about the way that your body communicates with you in a unique which is unique to you. So how do you know you're hungry and what are the ways in which your body lets you know that you're hungry. How do you know when you're full and what are the cues that your body sends you to let you know that you've had enough to eat start to build awareness of these different cues so that you can build that sense of trust in your own body and you don't need to just look up what is a proper portion size for this. Food, but rather how much of this food do I actually need until I'm satisfied. And also just to start responding to your hunk like the bait the most basic intuitive eating recommendation I can make is just to honor your hunger which is another of the principles of intuitive eating. So when you feel hungry instead of like questioning yourself or asking yourself if it's okay to eat or if you can justify it in some way like what if you just gave yourself permission to eat and then you just moved on with your day and what would that change for you?	1.0

Yeah, I just feel like what is more empowering than like finding what you love about your body? What else is there in life? You know what? I mean? I agree. I think we criticize our self enough that like when you can find things you love hmm, like take it and run with it Jaclyn. What's one thing you love about your body? Just one thing. I know what I love about your body what you have the best behind you're gonna say that I mean, they're not bad. They're pretty good. You have like the opposite like you have the best ass.

So these cartoons that were like predicting parts of the future now, I don't know if it's you guys but like at this point in time, I think I'm starting to watch them since a lot more just to see like If they can if they're going to predict anything else about the future, you know what I mean? Like I've been starting to watch The Simpsons more because you know, if they predicted 20 things they're mostly can be a good something else in the oven. So that was the topic of discussion for that while we're on the topic. Anyways, anyone have a favorite like cartoon they watch	1.0

I do admit sometimes I do lie, and I just don't want to go to school but this time I really don't feel good. Oh, so we're really working on like the telling the truth. Yeah and up to give you a millionaire have book The Lying is it's a challenge because like that's the worst to me like being a liar is like it's awful because no one can trust you. And so we're trying to teach her that well when you tell us you don't feel good and you're lying about it. We can't trust you. So go to school. I have laid in bed all day. See you at 4:00.	0.0

Like, what's got you entry what's got you peaked right now really interested to see, you know, we get asked all the time. When as the recession coming in we were on the largest expansion Area Cycle from a building. Environment standpoint that we've ever been on in kind of recorded history. And so everyone's waiting for the other shoe to drop and for there to be some sort of Market pull back, but barring any sort of mega event. We don't see a giant monolithic downward shift in the construction industry happening like in 2008 where the music just stopped overnight. We do see pockets of the industry from a sector level and a geographic level that will begin softening, you know at different rates. I'm going to different times but I'm most interested to see how contractors react to that change and markets and I think contractors this time around have been more sobered and more cautious and maybe more paranoid than contractors were in a seven and a way where if you flash back to 2007 times were good. There wasn't a lot of people that were scared of a downturn and then boom all of a sudden. We were caught in a new reality. I think you flash forward to today and it's almost the opposite mentality that we see in the marketplace where as people are constantly paranoid about when the market is going to ship that they're thinking about today how to prepare their Organization for living in a different tomorrow is so so we have we have a lot more confidence. I would say from a broad sense that the contractor Market is much more prepared to deal with a recession than they were in. Seven or at least they thought about it and planned about it more now. It's still probably be painful for some but I think the construction in secret could probably use a slight pullback for the amount of stress that's out there right now on labor markets for my stress. It's on contractor balance sheets currently as they're trying to execute all this work slight cooling off period although I don't never with the recession on on any industry or any economy a slight cooling off period could actually be a chance. Or the construction industry in North America to catch its breath.	0.0

Now. I may have mentioned earlier that you want to straighten that front entrance area at the beginning of A Clean cleaning session, but now it's time to go a little bit deeper as far as just cleaning all of your living areas. So in any living room or family room, you're probably going to want to straighten your couch cushions or throw pillows. Maybe you have DVDs video game controllers things of that nature that need to be placed where they go and then you probably are going to want to wipe off your coffee table and end tables you might have other destined to do but the areas where we actually eat and drink it.	1.0
Yeah. Mr. Honey. You should just make sure that it's a site safer environment.	1.0
Yeah, so we that's a really great question and you depending on who you ask and Industry you get different answers around that, you know for your commercial guys. They're looking at you know, what can be what could be marginalised in a commercial building. Right? And so that really speaks to things like bathroom pods or you know, anything with a bed really is replicable. So if you think about multifamily product launching even health care hospitals mean one of my clients ones don't The hospital is really just a hotel with Med guess and so it's it's maybe a little bit more complex modularization, but that is really where we think of modularization on the on the commercial side of things on the on the industrial side of things because the downtime is so expensive and an industrial environment. There is a much more incentive to explore off-site construction and push the boundaries of what could really be accomplished through modulars. Ation, and so the modules that you are seeing in the industrial environment are massive large to the extent where some of them can't even be trucked in other being shipped down rivers or up rivers or across oceans, you know from one side of the world to the other massive ships. You're seeing this very very large Mega units modulized units and it's because of the complexity of the work in the preciousness of So time in that industry in oil and gas to wear weeks mean millions of dollars for an operation and if I'll that can be constructed in another facility either in another state on the other side of the globe and be shipped in just in time to be put in place with minimal disruption to operations. That's really the advantage.	1.0
They that it could only be used for very large scale transactions. I mean starting with the men's suit may be okay, but then buying things like Vehicles buildings That's also a rather large objects. It is never been really a medium of exchange and daily transactions daily transaction was always silver or some alloy of silver or some or bronze or something like this or this storm. Okay, and that's actually a good thing. It's good that people actually own personally control. The money of the country lutely for mises is we talked about the ocean school before and these economies that I admire most is the end of his career. It was precisely this consideration that you stressed a lot. I said, well, you know sound monetary system. It's the people themselves each all individual Market participants who personally control a part of the money supply and so they only had the money in their pockets or at home and so on. So that's truly Democratic populist control of this crucial social institutions and silver allows that if you impose gold on On the economy and that is exactly what has happened in the last quarter of the 19th century. Like when silver was demonetized was a political movement top down movement and gold was imposed as a money on the the economy. Then you automatically get a shot in the arm of thinking because you cannot use Golden daily transactions that it's you need to have some money substitutes that can take the place of gold but in smaller denominations in Daily exchanges So that's why banking has become so strong and has developed. So strongly in the last Decades of the 19th century. Then of course all through the 20th century now, let me close this in and get to the gold treasure gold. So I start thinking about gold as a monetary instrument, but I've come to the conclusion that God is actually very important in a free society and a free economy as a store. value is eat as a natural way of saving for especially for people who don't know the first thing about financial markets and financial techniques that risk management and what have you very straightforward and simple way to save some of your Revenue to put some money aside for your old age and so on it's just too to stock gold coins and that's what people have been doing for many centuries and I think the reason why central banks are so adamant in controlling the gold price and preventing that the gold price in a foreseeable way it goes up which would happen in an actual free market is that precisely goal is the main competitor not necessarily as money for Fiat money, but it's the natural. For financial markets.	1.0
That's actually Grand Falls did In Gravity Falls was like if you were really into it there they put secret messages and stuff. They had like a lot of things actually at the end of the at the end of the show. If you were when they were on the bus, there's like a secret message and you pee decoded it. It said something and then a guy posted something on a store on his Twitter later and like a year later and it was like a whole scavenger hunt set up by the person through the show.

Well those profound thank you. That really was that changed like that. I've been thinking about that later time again. I'm not always an upstanding citizen the other day saw kid wearing a trump shirt went up to him and said hey asshole dumb fucking shirt, and then I walked away. So like I am not always tolerant like that's that's not to say I'm always a fucking piece love ya person. Like I have my mole of unity respect. Yeah, you know Fleur Fleur life, baby. They'd always the case. But I try as hard as I can and that's all you can do. That's all you can do and again like that comes back to like kind of what I was talking about are just being kind to yourself. You know, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall back. It's okay, but if you're mean to yourself, you're going to sink down deeper into it. So what I used to do when I was in high school. Yeah. I know I'd be like, yeah, I fucking suck. Ooh, I'm going to go do this and then feel worse about myself and be like Oh, my life sucks. I'm like, yeah. Yeah for me. Yeah for me then your victim card gets maxed out and you're like I need to make some changes definitely, you know, there comes a point when you're just like damn it really be all me not all you but like well, no, it didn't a its. It says I don't know. It's just your responsibility to take care of it, but it's not your fault. No exactly. Yeah, because like you it's not your fault that your brain isn't firing neurons correctly and like you don't have enough chemicals. Of Serotonin or dopamine? You can't regulate go green like it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with it a hundred percent. Yeah, because you know, you don't want to be you don't want to be kind of putting out more sadness into the world if that makes sense. Yeah, if humans don't have a way out like if a cell doesn't have a way out it will die. Yeah, like it doesn't have any pores. Yeah, it will like become full of its own waste and die and that's like people if they don't have any Outlets they become I'm full of negativity and they can't Thrive. Yeah, you know really? Well that's where made up ourselves. Yeah, exactly. And so it's like just making those channels to connect with things that you really love isn't really important because if you get in the flow state where you're like, I'm forgetting that time is a thing. I'm forgetting about everything else like when you paint or like stuff like that like that's when You're happy. Yeah when you're going out, yeah, not even happy but just like it was kind of music and yeah concerts and dancing or after something you forget or moshing for a while pockets are the best or they make you remember when they play that one song. Yeah. It's remember that memory and just cried out. Yeah, that's so true. Yeah. A depression is a bitch it can make you think a lot of things that aren't true, but just know that. Your thoughts aren't always real and just note that even though it does not seem like it you have the ability to overcome it. Yeah, it's in you it's in all of it's not gonna happen overnight. Hmm definitely but it can get better and it does get better like speaking as someone in high school who's always thinking about dying. Yeah now I'm 22 almost I don't think about die every day definitely. It's good. Yeah, and if you obviously like this goes without saying almost like if you're feeling these negative thoughts like please tell someone like people want to hear it people would rather hear you complain then hear about you dying a hundred percent. So like there's outlets for that too. Like there's support groups. Like there's so many things you can try like so many things you can try and it's not like It's not like one thing it's not like maybe one thing is going to fix you. Like it's going to be a bunch of different things that you use in your little toolbox exactly to get better. So find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia your straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms enough.	1.0
I know a lot. I know a lot of people probably thought that Holly was going to win last week in that shocker with post. I went to that game in man that game was crazy. I was watching you all's game online at the same time that I was at that game trying to keep up with both games and it was crazy to think because I guess Holly thought they already had The bag and post kind of surprised on him. You guys have been blowing people out my playoffs like if these have been like big wins, like if you guys blow out Stratford, that's gonna be the craziest thing. I know it's gonna be a dogfight. I have a feeling and this game What do you want to say to the proper Nation? Who's gonna travel to playing boo on Thursday nights support the team?	1.0
So basically I jumped in like conditions were pretty much perfect. So two days before on the Thursday the weather it was really hot was like 37 38 degrees here and you know, you sort of thought. It was going to be like that. They would have cooled the race off. And then thankfully it cooled down on Friday. I went from 38 down to about 15 degrees like was crazy and it was raining and windy and so didn't really want that either too cold to win. But then so the of the morning of the race it was cool, but clear and there what was a bit Breezy at the start line and But you really I'd rather be a little bit on the cold side at the start line and and which is you know, so it was perfect at no point did I think I'm too hot and so yeah really lucky in that regard. And so yeah, it took off with the crew. And so this is a lot of people who are listening who are local live in the south Australia area and know the race, so this will Echo a lot. So we've had a bit of rain here. So things were very green. So the whole course looks beautiful this show is awesome. And so lots of you run through lots and lots of farmland and through quite a few conservation parks and everything was just Lush and green and so we and it is just and I really did spend a lot of time really paying attention to the course around me even though I've seen it a lot and I know I'm very familiar with the course. I always try to make a point of being aware of the beauty and of what I'm doing rather than just focusing in on myself too much and being because I find when I focus in too much on my my what's going on in my head I end up falling into a hole and negativity hole. So yeah first I wanted to start out slowly and first 500 meters. I started out nice and slow and then we one of the things we do. In this race, you have to climb a lot of fences like Farm barbed wire fences and stuff. And so on the highest and Trail they have these Styles setup, which is like just a little steps that go over the fence and throughout the hundred case. There's probably dozens. There's so many of them you get so sick of them by the end and it just gets so hard to climb over the fences and it slows your right down and the very end so	1.0

If you happen to buy a bull that was you know, the similar genetic line do you have well, I you know, I it's not so much about when I'm riding bulls as much as you know, like I said, I like the speedballs because I grew up around them. But then for me now I like going back to any Anything that that's related to page blood and that's just because of value, you know, we were talking about jive turkey while ago again, he comes up and Toby Floyd rays that go but he's out of a page bull. I don't know what I that's messing about that. I think yeah. Okay. So whatever that is, I don't know but you bull guys know what he is.	1.0

Hmm.	1.0
Bye. Bulls you can you can at least find find somewhere where they'll get along and don't just have to put them all together. All right. Yeah. Well and I try not to mix too much with young and old that's the other thing you guys probably the same thing is if he generally when they're young and Too Young or whatever young and old this doesn't work. I try and mix bulls that are kind of in the same kind of age bracket. Not not too much because II If you get too many youngsters In Their Own Zone, you know how many Smart Ones they're all just thousands of goofy. But then at the same time I try and just do it that way. I'm not saying, you know, and I don't know there's there's mixes that you're thinking it's all right. This is a perfect mix or getting along great and then one day the fight breaks out your welcoming six and you know, we all know that that program but So that's how I how I have my set and then the sixes or so, but and then the second part of your question, I already forgot. What were the how many trips you you put on the moles a year? So, you know, we have 20 rodeos and and that includes some bull rides and stuff. So not as we all know not every bull goes to every event but generally when they go they got they get back twice, so probably around, you know, 15 to We find out it's probably early and and but remember our our season doesn't start till the end of March and it's over, you know, probably around middle of October. So we kind of so strip for pretty consecutive. It's not like we you know, you know, it's spread throughout the 12 months. We only Rodeo for about seven months out of the year. And I mean excluding you like the NFR and that kind of thing, you know, but you only take such a hit small. There, you know a handful of them on speaking in terms of the whole herd not just hand out of them, you know, so yeah with with that being said have you I mean being that you know, and I think if I'm not mistaken and maybe it's changed now, but some of the rodeos out there California and stuff they may only have rights or buying buying bulls. Have you figured that some Bulls just can't take that whereas, you know, Omaha and and Boot Hill and bad news they can take That right? Yeah, so I actually most of the bulls that you're right some of the that is one thing I've learned about the bull deal that I I did not know before is I didn't realize how important in this sounds really silly and kind of naive but I didn't realize how important the the deliveries were on on the Bulls until the last few years before I you know, I always kind of treat them like horses are pretty good about you know, they kind of take a scoot out of there and they go pretty straight for a while before they start into their Circle. Usually well with the bulls as we all know if a bull Curtis back right gate, he he's so wired and program to do that right there if the gates in his way or if everything it's hard for him that change it up if they've if they've done it done it very long a good example is is so I have a good buddy in the Northwest and you guys know him and my Quarry he has a bull call Cowabunga and so Years ago we were going Cowabunga is always out of the left and we decided he Mike's bringing the reading and reading rodeos. All right. Well, we might thought well heck we'll try and figure out how to get Cowabunga out of the the right. So we were going to we're going to running through this dry if running through and making turn out of there out of the right. We hiding tailed just dry. Nobody even there now we can it was all we could do to make that simple sucker turnout. Out of there to the right. He just wouldn't get one do it just like is the only thing that has to be spraying or something. I don't know that goofy little pot liquor. We couldn't hardly get him to turn out of that properly and finally, II think what we finally ended up doing is running around running around in and doing it until he finally kind of went out there but it kind of ran down the gate even dry. Anyway, we tried to Buck him and it didn't work and gave her a ride and all that. So going back to my original point the it's if if they've if they've been out of one delivery very long. It it's so programmed in their mind. So for me, it's been hard to switch him. But I just try and change it up when they're young, you know before when I see like when I buy up a little if you know we get to a place is only has rights and and hopefully the Bulls young enough. I see I just start changing them up right away and and make them, you know learn to do it that way now. Obviously, I have some that don't don't don't ever change like jive turkey you were talking about him and Was too a while ago, you know, he's right there to the left. He's never been out of any other delivery and he's really good. So why would I mess with it?	1.0
So we think this is wrong then why does why is it taken? Why isn't anybody else kind of picked up on it and said we'll hang on a minute. Keynesian economics doesn't really work as it should Austrian economics does and of course there are many Austrian economics proponents out there who are trying to fight their corner, but if it It is so obviously correct. Why hasn't the kind of white? What's what I want to get trying to get to is what what's preventing this wider pickup in economics in the universities across the world.	0.0

I mean if you can think of anything draft related, I've probably been working on it. I've got my own personal big board that I've been kind of putting together that I'm hoping to release probably the top 100. I am going to be nowhere near the level that the guys should like the draft. Gar, as far as how in-depth into the prospects I get I'm not able to watch 300 guys. I just don't have the time for that. However, I'm hoping to release the top 100 which would be a first for me. Hopefully working towards maybe a top 200 next year. So but that's kind of hot right now and also the Packers thresholds as one of my I think my proudest little accomplishments that I put together. It's just, you know, I can think Justice mosquito for putting together the hard data and then Then I just kind of put it all together each year and last year. It was relatively predictive. So I decided to do it again this year, even though you know, it's only good to come second year. He pretty much kept to the thresholds that were established under Ron wolf and that and then under Ted Thompson so we can get a little bit more into that, but I'm pretty excited for our show today.	1.0

Okay, go ahead and I have it up right now. And so here it is new podcast review by five stars, but five star review by evilly kneel friend of the podcast white climb Lacroix are delicious. Hey guys, really love the podcast a ton. The only thing that would make me love it more is if I could listen to it while wearing boxers slides really enjoy both of your guys content and personalities and the podcast is always really funny. The only thing that could be improved upon. Oh is if launders would finally give white cloth a chance and stop with his blind hatred of such a delicious drink Lacroix is also good, especially the tall Earth in cans with the to flavor. Did you just write the second would be angrier about his opinions? If you didn't have such a great bull cut all of you including Nathan because he needs more love.

Podcast what do you want to call it? You want to say the name? Yeah, it's take 43 and it's take 43 because well, there's a problem. I'm sorry about the other 42 takes I was freestyle rapping and I dropped like oh like is like a lot of f-bombs and so we couldn't use any of those. It's true. He did you know, and but you know, hopefully one day I'll be able to work out like at least 50% of the f-bombs and it can be our intro song.	1.0
Doesn't it make you feel good?	1.0
You're great. Keep it together. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard. That's that's where you're drawing the boundaries of the about the fact that their hurtling through space and freezing apartment of might be different maybe SP gravity's like 400, but then it seems like the gravity for other occasions like when he's running does it look like it looks like it's the same gravity as Earth. Okay. So let me let me address this from not a physics. We're not going to talk about Gravity of planets like that has some factor into it. Like it's like different different races to so like there's there's like so you're talking about the main character the Mandalorian the guy on his armor. So like 'hey, so the lure is that he mandalorians never take off their armor basically like so he's used to that so he's probably like pretty strong, you know,	1.0
Yeah, well yeah they put they put in weird ones at certain times because I think it's weird place not it's not that it's like I don't know I think it's just the way it sounds like it's just weird vocalizing like I think that iCarly has in between music too and I could be wrong not to bring up a Nickelodeon show on a Disney related podcast again, but I think that they also have him to music the Miranda Cosgrove and singing It's just instrumental but I think that's why I don't like this one and it's weird because again, she's just like whoa whoa, whoa	0.0
You got a macaque. Yeah real you got a parachute to come home with yes.	1.0
No, she came out she came out during a during a transition at a guard so to speak to an R&B. So I don't know if she just got lost in the shuffle or I know she has some like some shit with a management and stuff like that. So it was just crazy, but she always made good music.	1.0
Cry it out because you're right. It's unfortunate that it took something like that. Yeah right to make us realize how do I don't know to bring that out of people.	1.0
Okay, so let's make the pick will go with Noah Fant from the University of Iowa at 30. So as I go down Diandra Baker to the Rams AJ Brown to the Patriots, of course that happens at Elite of the Colts shikai polite to the Raiders Earth Smith to the Jaguars at 38 for nodal there. Jeffrey Simmons to the Broncos goes to their packers back on the board just in Lane was last one taken for the Detroit Lions Packers back up at pick number 44 other get names that came. Off the board where Jerry Tillery Jonathan Abram Greg Little a money or a Warrior from Penn State. Yeah, I need because you see from West Virginia. Like it's a Jeffrey Simmons Crane Creek Lindstrom from Boston College. So Packers back up and around to pick 44 top names on the board Eric McCoy Le Insight interior lineman from Texas A&M is the top of the board Hollywood Browns there at the from Oklahoma the receiver Kelvin Harmon from NC State Daniel Jones quarterback from do. Duke Dexter Lawrence the massive lemon from Clemson Debo Samuel South Carolina receiver Paris Campbell, Ohio State receiver, then a couple of safeties Deonte Thompson and Taylor rep are the top of the board right now one Thornhill not too far behind them either as well. So Tyler, I'll turn to you year representing the coaching staff with all the film work. You've done. What play would you like to see at 44 for Green Bay of the names that are out there, you know, I look at a guy like Deonte Thompson.	1.0
One thornhill's the guy that I've really been toting on social media. He's a guy that fits all of their athletic thresholds. I think he's a very under-the-radar player this year. He's gonna be a good pick. What for whoever takes him in the second round. I don't think he goes any higher than the second. You know, I wish that a guy like Garrett Bradbury. I haven't heard his name, but I'm assuming he's gone by this point. So Garrett Bradbury would be fantastic selection at 30 or 40 for same thing with The other Center I can't members name. I'm blanking on the guy. However, Chris Lynch from he's not Center in Turkey alignment. Sorry Crystal incident from Boston College both.	1.0
Yeah, so so just because you don't have the nicest camera just because you're shooting with an iPhone just because you don't have A lot of lights just because you don't even have another person to make movies with leaving yourself that kind of follows what you're saying don't have an ego and I think you'll be just fine in this production world.	1.0
As you do you think there's a natural tendency towards inflation as in Keynesian or neo-keynesian economics?	0.0
Yeah, but then it doesn't make you so happy that what we've got now it does work and how quickly a job because it was just money wasn't it that we couldn't see Morgan as one man by himself if he would have had billions there were had all these records on Isn't it you didn't own all those players, but obviously we couldn't buy them and we got 10p Strikers.	0.0
Yeah, so we had a look at it. I'm sure the next day and it was like pretty sore close to the second metatarsal. So I was like or yeah, but this could just because you're using Sparks more and doing a bit more speed, but we'll just be honest the quarter side and cross train for the week and try to calm it down with some ice and some some anti-inflammatories and And then we looked at it another week later and I still was no greater Yeah, we actually had to pull out of the 5K chance that way because well second time here at he's like second year running.	0.0
I would do 6040 60/40 I think 60% diet 40% workout. I think you know you do have to work hard to to get like you can't just you know, it's a good combination of both. I just say I would put 60/40 because I feel like a lot of people when it's January 1st. The very first question that they asked for that the devil's tell themselves is I got to go to the gym. They're not they're not thinking I gotta save calories or I gotta watch my eat my food just like I gotta go too. Like a lot of times when people are broke their like I got to find more ways to make money right now. You have to find ways to decrease your expenses. I focus on what you can control first, right? And so it's just really about detaching yourself keeping track. You know, I think having the ability what one of my mentors told me what doesn't get measured does not get improved. You have to have some type of Quantified measurement so that way okay. It's a Earth to see this time, how can I get a B next time How can I get a right? So for people track a calories while your food out for not waiting some of your food out in your kind of just estimating that can only take you so far but honestly once you get in the habit of doing so keep things simple prep your meals I just have a whole bunch of foods, you know ready in the fridge. That way you don't have to eat things that you know overload on things that are healthy for you now and you can still have a good time like you don't have to, you know, go be all in. Have to be too extreme like find a balance, you know, enjoy your life suposed to be a speed round.	1.0
Some sort of success.	1.0
I just want me before Six or seven days absolutely Macedonian got as well, isn't it? That's what they'll go.	1.0
Musicians and so on and the lifestyle so answers kind of suspect but what I understood as long as long as you got the sex and the drugs who needs the Rock and wrong definitely impressed me so much was it came out that he was such a good person. Yeah. He was a lovable person. It was good to others. He was just a positive influence on all others around it and this reminded me of another thing there. Documentary has seen many years before about alphabets right Elvis.	1.0
Yeah, I think she actually killed the brunette and then accordingly we Gucci Mane. I think that's my there's definitely my favorite out of all of the songs on here. I just think that be was dull but I like all the production my homies are trying to argue with me and he was like man, he's like just sound like some simple shit he over here talking about his kids and talking about, you know, I'm sorry cardi B every song by Mike. What else are you supposed to do? Like, this is what he's been going through for a whole year. Bam, like I would rather him talk about what's going on his life then fake it and act like nothing happened because we clearly know this something happened. So this is what you do when you grow and you make songs and you make projects about your life. Like you have to grow you have to evolve like obviously he still talking about like the same old shit, like like getting money and mess with women is stuff which I still find it funny because they're like was like, we know what's going on with your life. But you know, you still gotta for the people that I get. Guess halfway don't listen or don't care. You still gotta keep up that Persona in a sense, but was still even with that like he still had some like some like really really touching and personal songs. Like don't lose me. That was a that was a very personal song Father for the very first songs on here and then came a long way that was probably like his one of the most personal songs those three right there. But but overall like I like the production I thought that you know for the majority it was upbeat. I was messing with it compared to the other two Migos projects and I think their overall like like in this is just comparing all the D'Amico's like he had the best like it was it was just no question. He definitely had the best albumin and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of songs on here and I've been listening to it ever since it came out. So so that's my take on it. How you feel about this like	1.0
you've created the mental space for forward-thinking and you can identify the immediate action in order to feel yourself about to move that each accept it a satisfied with it. You've wasted enough time. You've wasted enough money. You've done enough of everything that has kept you back from your greatness. Now's your moment to do everything that pushes you closer toward your dreams.	1.0

It's controlled as calm or breathing for them.	1.0
I almost feel like they were quieter. Like I don't commend ourselves. They were more I think hesitant to say anything like they said things obviously, but they were so quiet. Down by the fact that the show talked about steric the actors talked about steric. We talked about steric. They were kind of off like they didn't have any sort of voice to that. They would come up occasionally and like different things and like complain but I feel like the required or back then they got louder sort of as the show started turning against Eric.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0

I got to be honest with you. You don't want to look back on your life old and gray and say I could add or I should have taken that one opportunity. That one action that one chance that could have given me a completely different life to move that engine order to build even just the slightest bit of momentum 1 inch is all it takes it's the time in your life where it's do or die. What are you going to do lock into what you want and lock out everything that wants to keep you from getting there but makes you feel happy and fulfilled what lights you up from inside. How do you want to feel as Person, it's the time when you're feeling like you're scraping the bottom of the barrel you're in the dark, but it's up to you to change your perception to shed some light on where you are. It's the time when you're ready to give up. But you know, if you do you'll never be able to live with yourself with the guilt and shame of not pulling yourself out of this state become your biggest support system. You can't keep allowing the lack of support from others to discourage you to the point where you don't take action and you end up giving up. Up on your dreams overnight success of the fantasy but real success is within your reach no matter who you are no matter where you are at in your life right now for you to pull your way back out of where you put yourself in understand it. Was you to put you there. No one else you you are here because of you and you're the only person that can get back out of it. So most people stop but successful entrepreneurs evide Learners and groups and individuals know, The Becoming better as a continuous consistent process not a game where the night sometimes we get too hung up on who doesn't support our Dream, right? My wife doesn't support my dream. My husband doesn't support my dream. My parents don't believe in my dream. Well, let me ask you a very important question. Do you support your dream your gifts your Billings your value? It's about you. You created the pot. You already lined the white and inclusive. It is now easier to identify the things that need to be learned from now you own it. You've heard of the instant success stories the Legends the Trailblazers the Rocks aren't they are the ones we Envy the other ones we want to be the stories. I've heard about people who achieve overnight success. They're just stories. It's a lot sexier to say someone just showed up and success rained down on them, but it's not the truth. There's always a hidden backstory of hard work of A lot of pain no one gets to the top without identifying what success feels like for them without sticking to it for 10 years or more without mastery. If you can't think if you can't bring yourself to move out of your current mental state to one of growth purpose and progress. I want you to follow me. Take a deep inhale. Ask yourself. What you need in your life right now close your eyes and exhale into the vision you have for your life. It's going to allow you to climb back out of the hole that you put yourself in shed light on your current position and be grateful for the experiences that are now about to take place. I'll ask you now. What is above you what's in front of you. You can't go any lower you spiral down as far as you can go. The only Direction now is up. All you have to do is just move that one inch many people won't understand why you're grinding they won't understand why you're attending masterminds and private workshops instead of partying all night long at the club. They're not going to understand that, you know that short-term sacrifices lead to long-term prosperity. Sometimes you need to let go of what you want now to get what you want later, but it's worth it because you're playing the long game success takes time success takes effort. But I promise you that when you finally get there, you'll look back at all of it, and you won't regret a single moment. They will understand that you're building a lifestyle that most people only dream about adding value that will pack the thousands of people and that what you do will leave a legacy long after you're gone from this Earth. They're not going to understand any of that and you know what you shouldn't care if they understand this or not. He's the thing to people can get to the one destination they can get to the same destination. But who's stronger at the end the one who had it easier or the one who started further back who started in a deeper hole who had to overcome more adversity those two people are going to get to the same spot the same destination. One of them is going to be stronger. Your only objective is to lock in on what you truly want for your Life so from now on get rid of the things that are just a distraction if it doesn't fall in alignment with your goals your values the direction you want to go and the place you want to be it is not for you. You need to Define your teeth aim not someone elses. The only way to achieve success without giving up on your happiness is to understand and Define. What is it? Like for you? You got to understand that when you have a vision or a great purpose to add value to the world. This is your journey alone to travel you need to clean yourself to look further than a few months a year. What do you want to do? Do and have at that time. Who do you want to be? How do you want to serve and contribute when you have that vision gets real with yourself and ask what needs to happen now to make that Future Vision my reality. So I take a deep inhale stand up straight lift your chin off your chest pull your shoulders back and start to look in the direction of where you want to go move that each when you get to that. State creating results in your area of expertise is almost effortless. It's an organic process that comes easily to you. Remember the further you spiral down just means the more growth there is on the way back up in the stronger you'll be and you're still waiting around for some kind of signal to finally go hard and give your dreams everything. You got stop seeing it as work ahead of you, but there's only growth ahead of you. There's only That can be had that's it. You can only go up from here and the growth is needed to be where you want to beat. I want you to tell yourself right now that you don't need permission to pursue your dreams. Not my permission not your family's permission not loved ones. Not any expert who rules or anybody else. Never needed anyone else has permission to tap into your greatness. The only kind of success that matters is the kind that lasts if you achieve success only to have it slip through your fingers. All you have then is Disappointment understand that you can't change what you've done wrong, but you can change your perception of it and that's what's going to help you move that inch.	1.0
I think like, you know, like the whole like that whole Thanos Gauntlet thing in Fortnight, even though it was very overpowered and yeah read about it. It was and it was a short period you so of fun even if you got killed in three seconds when he lets someone who's that? Oh, that's right. So if so, I wouldn't even mind if I got killed by typing in a couple seconds if I could just have the chance to like fight for	0.0
Big fox big facts, so there you go people still no no concrete release date yet. But again, we will keep you all updated on adventures during this 3 because that is definitely my most anticipated project of this year so far. Let's get into the album reviews. We have one album that we are going to review today and that is going to be offset father of four now all set as head of hair. The 2018 the man has been getting it be for people. He got married secretly. He had a child with cardi B and he's been in his share of scandals. Not only did he get into some beef with with Chris Brown. Soulja Boy is going to come at them a little bit. And of course the whole cheating scandal which had pretty much everybody who was a cardi B fan on his head and saying that he was piece of shit and all that stuff. He was supposed to actually release his album last year. Here but ended up getting pushed back and I'm sure that it got pushed back because of all the scandals that he just had to try to salvage his relationship him and cardi end up getting separated for a little bit. But now they're back together taking care of the child and looks like they're being a family and they for the most part gotten through all of that stuff because that's what people when you love somebody. That's what you do. You got to fight to keep your girl and when he ended up bringing out the project, you know, The Breakfast Club and actually respected what he said on the interview, it seems like he's He's evolved and reflected a lot. I know that everybody is Presley these blind fans and want to just automatically condemn somebody if they do one bad thing or they do a couple bad things. But at the end of the day that's his wife, and that's that's his baby mamas life or his wife's like that ain't your life. So who are you to judge when you're on the outside looking in like that's not your thing that you have to go through and it seemed like all say realize that it specially in their Breakfast Club interview and on this album it. Definitely reflected a lot of like what he was going through. He definitely had multiple songs about his children about cardi situation. He apologized and million times on it and it seemed like he actually wants to be a better husband and a better a better father to his the newborn and his other three kids that he had with his other baby mamas now, obviously as far as talent wise talent and celebrity wise, I don't think we know any of them compared to cardi B and even if they did I'm pretty sure cars if he's gonna The biggest baby mama at all I know but but they're still you know, not to not to discredit any other any other baby mamas we had children with but obviously he you know loves all of them just the same and I just think that he's overall just grew as a person which people can do so for this particular album has 16 songs total features Big rule. Shout out to be a group. That's definitely a huge huge thing and Atlanta Jayco Jay Cole been doing a lot of features. I'm actually very Why did he just keep jumping on features? So that's that's pretty well gonna yeah, see low on here Travis guy 21 Savage cardi B. Quavo and Gucci Mane and I will say my favorite songs from this album would be quarter. Millie clout wild wild west and how did I get here? Now as far as this album compared to the other solo albums by takeoff and quavo. I gotta say that I think offsets out. Was the best I would have we said that that was going to happen. Yeah, but I think that we were a little bit worried just because when take off sound came out that was it was very underwhelming. So a lot of people like man, why don't all says I was gonna be but I think that again he had the best album after listening to it. I think he has some really good features. I think that in and this might be a hot take here is might be unpopular opinion. I think the offset out of the Migos is probably the most versatile. Especially after hearing this album. I thought that quavo initially was quavo the hood guy and you know, he he's a good songwriter or whatever. He definitely definitely rent some songs first Ojai name artist, but I think that quavo just kind of got to take a step back because quavo really isn't the lyrical dude. I think they offset is like takeoff and quavo mixing the one I think that he has a bigger a bigger bigger repertoire that Really propels him above his other counterparts and I think they really showed on this album, especially with the features. I didn't find one feature to be like out of place or sound weird North Star was CeeLo Green CeeLo. Green killed that obviously had big Ruban the very first song Father for J. Cole killed and on. How did I get here? Cardi B actually think our DB I'll wrap them which is funny on clout. I think the party be gonna kill - I would like, whoa, I'll say whoa. This is gotta is kind of	1.0
Oh gross that's actually so nasty. I mean, I don't think I'm crazy here, right? That's actually so gross. It's normal. It's not normal.

I may be getting used to stuff there are some stuff so I actually kind of had a question. So this happens in a lot of movies not just Star Wars but where if they put on like big bulky suits The shirt and they they have objects like they're handing coins across the counter that are like larger than normal. They don't look like they have the correct weight. Like I know they might be on another planet may be different gravity. But do you know what I'm talking about? Like when he's climbing on the giant tractor and they're throwing shit at him the Wookiees are ya they and it doesn't feel like they're those blocks and stuff are the right weight. So feels like looks not Dido cheap corny. I don't know how to put it put it but doesn't look realistic.	0.0

Stood in the statements you were making about Syria being a suit serial Builder and I've heard it said in the past and I believe this was amongst commercial users that 90% of the things that are built are built by a one-time owner. I don't know that I could substantiate those statistics at this point because that's probably 10 to 12 years old in anecdotal at best. But are you seeing that as kind of the Difference Maker it seems like that's what picture you paint. That's the Difference Maker between a large industrial users is that they've got the capital in the know how to plan? Whereas these commercial users that are in there from one time. They don't have the capital to know how or the care because the savings aren't large enough to go into it with a mentality of we're going to prefabricate. We're going to modularize we're going to do off-site construction. Is that fair to say?	0.0

I think this kind of weaves into a lot of things that we've talked about today. We work with hundreds of contractors every year and we see the whip statements see the balance sheets. You see the income statements and otherwise good or excellent year for a contractor can be wiped out by one or two bad projects. And if you wind the tape back on those one or two bad projects there was probably a lot of warning signals that happened during the pursuit phase as to it was a project larger than we've ever built. Or was a new owner that we've never worked with or gosh at a time. We didn't think we quite had the team to do it and she's like a culmination of a lot of those factors that result in a really bad project and for contractors projects from my margin standpoint for my project Sim profit standpoint can go marginally better, but they can go infinitely worse. And if I had a megaphone to speak to the construction industry would be to really hone in. In on Project selectivity particularly now at the top of the market cycle when there's more opportunity than there has been in recent years and contractors. I think have I will say the luxury of being more selective being more intentional about the types of work that they take on what Tyler thanks for being with us today. Thank you. It's been a pleasure.	1.0
It was surreal. So, you know soju. Comes out and you know, it's just like, you know poison Hood came out. It was just like we felt like it was this new movement. You know hip-hop is everything is happening at the same time like you go back to that time frame. You can't just look back at my career. You gotta look it with hip-hop is that you got look at everything to inform you of how it felt to me because it was just like we just felt like we were at the tip of something, you know crazy happening right now. And if and for the culture this overuse were now but that's what this was like the the second birth of the culture and then, you know book this movie to program which for me was, you know again, I thought I was gonna play football. So now I'm getting to live out this kind of thing and the writer director of that film David Ward, he wrote major league and so while we were filming the program he was like, you know, I guess there's something contractually was happening with Wesley Snipes who played in the original Because I didn't really want to do majorly to that wasn't my cup of tea. But again that loyalty thing I'm like yo this dude gave me my second job site. Let's go rock. So when rock with that and then Higher Learning, I think John Singleton originally wanted to POC to play Malik, but then pop got locked up. And so then the, you know getting higher learning it was it was a glorious time. It was a great time. It was like, you know the to taste your dreams and to get to live them out is invaluable, you know, and You know, you know you making a little bit of money and you know, you just for me it was like surreal I was so young when this whole process by the time that I'm not even 21 by the time you know, Higher Learning is coming out.

So yeah, it was like, I think I'm not going to that. So anyway yesterday girls like Did you start at South both 75? I'm like no. No, didn't you enjoy it? She's like, okay. Just checking.

Like I don't go like I want to I do it feels good for me that day or if I need a rest day. It's great. And then yeah, um, that's what I do on that kind of a thing. Yes words are hard today.

Well, so yeah. No, I mean I'm not going to sit here and say they're the best ever but they were awful good like well one cult in particular I actually sold in the security and I think it was like 2012. Well, it's see I would have been 2012. I sold a horse. Pony man, he belongs to stay Smith now and he was he was out of that cult crop, you know, and then there was you know, he was by far the shiniest one. I mean, I guess I sold him to stay. I'm pretty sure it was 2012. He bought him there at the Benny Binion sailed, you know the bucking horse or a bucking horse security actually stays puts it on and and yeah, so Smith, I'd buck that colt there and Smith. Bought him and I think he's been to the NFR every year since like, oh, well, yeah, he's he was the shiniest one by far and then oh, I have a few other ones that are just really nice horses, you know that route. And so I think that first whole crop, but probably had well I'm going to say I can't I don't recall but I'm gonna say between 15 and 20 Colts to start with and I'm about I have when do you start those horses? I'm sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Wendy's start those horses, you know, how long is it before you start to know if you made the right breeding decision? Oh, well, sometimes a level five years, but for that particular to answer your question directly, the first part of the question was, you know, when do we start a I start dummy are blocking the Colts when they're too and and and I just dummy buckham once when they're to unless they just flat run off if they just flat run off. Then on my block him again, you know and do something a little bit different just but I bought them wants when they're two or twice. Like I said and then same when there's three and then so then when therefore I get people on them, you know, they start with their Riders. So a lot of them a lot of them horses have anywhere from two three, maybe four trips by the time they're four year olds, and then then it's time for a rider and and sometimes you know, they They you know, if you can see that they're pretty sure of their feet and their they have a really controlled style and they're you know, they're when I say a controlled style, you know, like the akkad. I got a pattern and they're like I said their feet are running room and all that's going on good and I feel confident. I'll stay up and not fall down with the guy. So I'll go ahead and put a guy on him with a couple of dummy trips and then and then the other ones, you know, there's those horses that I've Listen, I hate to admit it but there's horses. I've raised it. It took six or eight trips to before I felt confident to put a guy on it because it was all down all of ya and and generally that's the wild or wasn't it and going back to the breeding. That's when they're bred wrong. They're too wild and you know bucking horses. Sometimes the the Layman fan gives bucking horses a bad rap like they're there and I shouldn't that sounds wrong. I got I wish I could I was better with my words, but They get kind of a bad rap like her wild and yeah, you guys know that's that's not the case at all. Some of these some of these horses are really gentle and really good to be around and and and generally speaking is the more quiet they learn calm. They learned Focus. They are the better bucking horses. They are they you know, they don't have to be Wild Buck. We all know that what a maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not a bucking horse guy got on some back in the day and never never did any good at it? Didn't ever understand it but aside from just sighs. How do you how do you choose which which event you want to Buck those horses a cracker or saddle bro? Yes. That's a really good question for me. First of all, you're going to see when you dummy block them kind of what they do with their head. And when I was talking a minute ago about the control their body control while there while they're bucking with just a dummy on that gives you a little bit of an indication of what event to do to put them in. in butt butt For me, I found more of their mother. So if their mother could take the bronc riding and tolerated it and she liked it and bucks in it. The Colts in seems to do that, you know, tools will follow suit now that's not always the case but a lot of the time it is, you know, an in an unfortunately the way as the way the rodeo business is now with the shorts. Age of bareback Riders, sometimes you are forced to put Colts in the bronc riding that you're not 100% sure if it's going to work or not when you're first blocking them around but sometimes there's it works out beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't but for the most part you kind of got a number one go with their style number two kind of their mom and then third the availability of the riders that are there that day you have very many of those horses that you may be starting. In one event and then decide that they need to go to the other event, or maybe they do both events or oh absolutely. So so I have a horse named Capone and he's been in a far five times. I think or maybe six and his mom is out of one of our famous men as Raggedy Ann. Well when I first started bucking Capone, he was a bare back and he went to the finals like for three or four times and bareback, you know in the bareback riding.	1.0

Oh for sure, but I'm really good at hiding it sometimes not necessarily around my kids or my husband. Because you day just kind of always get the worst of you unfortunately because they know you the best but you know, like tally your spouse or tell your kids like I've gotten into the Habit where I'll just tell the least like Haley some really struggling right now. Just give me a minute. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be short with you because I think like just saying it out loud is like this is a real thing. Like if I had a headache I would say hey, I have a headache or I sprained my ankle or whatever. It's like this is a real thing like this is Real condition that I have and you know, it's really flaring up today are probably having a rough day with it and just having somebody to that you can reach out to and sometimes like just laughing about how ridiculous anxiety is because it can get you like the other day Dex came home from school and he just I go are he just doesn't seem like himself. He just seems kind of sad and so are goes. Hey, buddy, so Dax is for okay, he goes hey, buddy. Do you have any pain in your back or your legs or your neck and that's was like I don't think so and here it looks at me and he goes well sometimes kids have cancer, you know, and that's how they find out about it and I was like what the hell if you can't say that to me and then I my brain like when you know, of course like, you know, I have a kid with cancer and how am I gonna deal with this and my mom has cancer but it's like I just had to kind of laugh and just shut it down and be like, nope. We're not gonna yeah. We're not gonna go there. Because it's not doing anything now, sometimes I've heard people what they'll say. Well what if this what if this and then they'll take it all the way? Yeah. Okay. Well, what if that does happen? Hmm. Well, okay. Well what you know and then just kind of played out and I mean even if the worst possible thing for to happen, there are people who they're resilient that you know, we will carry on and so I think it's hard at like it's easy right now to talk about all this because We're not in the middle of like an anxiety storm because with wait till this afternoon is this weekend, right?	0.0

Especially if people are just kind of using that toilet brush as needed and then I keep it soaking in a solution in a cleaning solution, you know in that holder so, you know, just whatever cleaning It usually kind of pour some in that holder and that makes your bathroom smell nice and keeps your toilet brush disinfected.	1.0

It's set for the to now the two who knew their fathers. Love them. You know what I mean? Love them. They I got a lot of juice for them and I learned through their Actions, you know on how to parent like you said earlier actively like they was always around one of my boys is you know, you had four boys they let me times like you need a new you 16 need a car.

Like it was never that way of thinking and I know it's hard for some people to understand like one of my videos recently got promoted by YouTube and it's actually really annoying because I have all of these Christians who are just so hateful like leaving so many nasty comments. I'm just like why are you liked so many people try to say like like not all Christians are bad, but like when 99% of the people are so I mean and then you get like one nice one and it's like okay obviously like something needs to change here, but they were all saying like you were never a real Christian. You must have never been saved like that's just impossible because and I feel like it's a defense mechanism where it's like if I was a real Christian and then left like what does that say about their belief system, you know, absolutely I think it's very fear and that's like it's so much projection and that's why you know,	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, that's great. Well, I really love following all the different businesses on Instagram and watching them grow. You just reminded me of something that I was in my early. Sighs I did make contact with a lot of real estate agents and I didn't hear from a few of them and then at least 12 months later one of them replied to my email. So it's like they kind of knew were there but they didn't really need you with that time or they weren't really convinced. You could help them at that time that they they eventually came around. So it's a nice like pass very slow burn slow so bad. Yeah.	1.0

So there's kind of a soaking involved there.	1.0
But if they if they leave and they go back to a new currency say the new drachma or whatever. It might be. There's no provision for that. Ultimately. We know they just create a new currency. Then that currency presumably would begin its life extremely weak. And that would that would have happened. If I sit in a similar way to the Asian financial crisis the late 90s where The currencies were pegged to the u.s. Dollar but not actually formed as part of a union as we Euro. So what we saw there is a model was the economy's did badly and that caused the pegs to go and then we saw this period of a complete collapse in the currency which made it unbelievably valuable to go and invest in country in companies there and and to visit of course you could stories of Tenten Pounds in Thailand, but it lasted you'd like for two weeks and then then it all settles down and it all recovers and look at Asia now, it's a Powerhouse.

I was determined to finish. I want to buy cowboy hat, which is what you've got if you finish the hundred and nine case, but yeah, I don't know.

And I think that's what she needs as well because no one really knew what she can do on the show and you know, She's super talented when she does but no one has ever seen her dance before and that's difficult when you're not a dancer, you know, so I feel like he's the perfect partner for her to just make her feel comfortable and no matter what just support her and they work so well together. They have the best chemistry.	1.0

Lee were the Australian version of a Navy SEAL for us it's accurate it's similar, but it's not exactly the same there are elements that we do the same job as crossovers but the Navy SEAL do a lot more soldiering than we do, you know, the clearance divers aren't generally getting chop it into war zones to go and assassinate terrorists and things like that. So we do attack swimming and mine clearance and reconnaissance with And even reconnaissance on land underwater explosive Ordnance disposal as well as land-based bomb disposal as well.

This woman was taking care of me and she ain't like three other kids and I was like for something it was before I went to school and like we were running around the house and I ran into the toilet knock myself out. So then like I can't I can't relate to this for the like the next three weeks. I had like a big-ass bubbler head. I can't relate to this not the toilet part but like My older sister went through this. Where is she like another lady took care of her because my parents were working. Yeah. My mom always works out. Yeah my younger sister did that but never me because we lived in the fucking farm. So my dad would always take me with him fun times. Even though now I realized I don't think it was taking care of me more like a child labor John.	1.0
Pretty obvious in yeah, that's the pin the that was the concern when it going into it small Squad, but new nighlok small squads and if we get any if you've got a few more injuries, not just Bali, we're really struggling at me.

I hope everyone's having a great day today. It's time to gear up for our big cleaning session. And if you're new to the show The Way We gear up for that is to make sure that we look presentable. Whatever that means for you freshen up a little bit. Sometimes we light a candle or turn on a wax warmer or sometimes. It's a matter of just opening a door or a window turning on some. And sliding some fresh air come through if it's a nice day. I know right now. I've got the air conditioner and the fan on so I'm not airing out my house, but I have my wax warmer plugged in.	1.0

So yeah, so it's like and Jughead loves it because I well he loves it because he tells everybody back at Riverdale High. It's like yeah to hang out with people that are actually Read Moby Dick, but I'm also thinking like well so far out of that Salon we never really saw much of anything with some people griping about having to read it and then we saw Brett being frustrated because Jagged butter pie. Point right really hear anything else from any other student made me think like yeah, these guys are it was really in-depth discussion about Moby Dick right?	1.0
I was a little sad on that one actually Ricky that tell them about what was going down with me though.	0.0
Mmm, I got I mean at least you can you can text me back. Yeah, but but if you can't see people, I mean you can't have you can't have Instagram and stuff on your phone.	0.0
So not yet. Probably true. I know like when I was a kid, my mom sat me down and was like, you can be a doctor a lawyer or a host of this Esports life pod that comes out weekly and here we are. This is what I chose. This is what I chose. And we're rolling in it man. Are you kidding me? This is what pays the fucking bills who thought we'd be here.	0.0
Yeah, you're my kid that I didn't even know about Mmm, I still think that's it seems weird that we've got a kid that is both a half-brother to book Betty and Jughead. Yep.	1.0
And so don't worry about don't like don't think about sickness or anything will say immediately afterwards you go to the hospital and get great antibiotics all that, you know the eating part which was you rather have to suffer through. I would rather suffer through I could probably eat a rat I would do a red because a rat it's like a wonderful thing. And once you're done with it, you're done with the I feel like with cockroaches or multiple. Love them and you have to experience it like over and over again until you finish the bowl when we eating for it's a it's a bowl or just say one a bowl of cockroaches. So say oh yeah later time.	1.0
Well part of the reason a lot of these shows aren't getting enough time to Like progress the story is because streaming is like taking over the game right now. That is true. Yeah, really putting a lot of operating on our TV channels and such that's on Netflix. Like a lot of stuff is on Netflix and Hulu know and those things that people would rather see then stuff that's on actual.	0.0
You mentioned right out the door.	1.0
It was so bad and I was just being like so just oh my God, I was literally being the worst human being so tell everyone I would do it was literally like talk about like some salt to the Earth like real awesome.	0.0

You like all of the seasons before the finale on Disney XD and I was I was like Loki sad because I was like damn this was a great show and it's about to be gone.	0.0
Yeah. I think I pointed. Well, yeah, I pointed at you. I say a speed, you know what I mean?	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and there's been and so I think when you think about particularly in this audience, the construction users Roundtable, which is comprised of a lot of industrial owners. All side says something they're pretty familiar with and it's really their conversations are how do we continue to push the envelope? How do we do more of it? And how do we get the rest of the industry on board namely contractors and I think - real space is an area where owners have really been leaders and that regard because the incentives are there two things off site or as maybe you look at the commercial side of the industry where commercial owners have kind of said well contractors can go figure it out. And if you can deliver a building faster or cheaper through off-site construction, we'd be interested in contractors go. Okay, great. We're not Apple or Google and we'll have billions of dollars worth of R&D to go figure this out come up with a new mouse trap. So it's innovation in manufacturing and off-site construction is sort of limped along this some extent and the and the commercial space because there's been a lack of funding or interest or incentives on either contractors around or side on the big stuff.	1.0
Like if it really I think the biggest part that people don't hit enough of consistently is just through the nutrition because if like there are the I've had clients that aren't extremely active. I have a 59 year old client. She was 278 pounds when we first met and she's lost 57 pounds. She's now in like 2:17 to some and for her to do it and she has any issues and she's five two five three this Asian lady. The biggest thing that we just focus on was her nutrition and she countered a calorie she weighed her food out. She kept her diet simple and she was losing weight. You know, we I was she trained with me two times a week and then I had her come and once on the weekend by herself and literally I would just prescribe her 20 minutes of cardio 10 minutes before ten minutes after a little bit of free weights here and there a little bit of machines and over time. It was really the nutrition that guided her to get to where she wanted to be, you know, so I think for a lot of people the nutritional part is hard, you know food is our Escape is definitely my Escape black. I love food, you know, but, you know a little bit of sacrifice like during the week and then you get enjoy yourself on the weekend. I think he's really again all about balance if you have 30 days if you're good, 25 out of those 30 days most likely you'll have results right always tell people Good day of bad eating or one bad day of eating will not hurt you in one good day. Beauty will not help you. It's really just about what are you doing for? The most part right? Don't focus on the little things. What are you doing on the bigger picture? Yeah like that.	1.0
Oh my God, that just gave me flashbacks to when he got beat up so bad that he almost died in a bush. That's not funny. But it is I don't know. I'm getting like flashbacks. I'm like, is he gonna be really dead this time?	0.0
My name is Mike. What's yours? Great. We've known each other for years Anson. Anyway, he will be for in January.	1.0
You know that you haven't eaten and they're no good anymore. You might want to remove those. So that's one way of cleaning out the refrigerator, you know, sometimes we have good intentions and by a lot of produce and don't eat at all. And you know, I have to get rid of that. Some of it can go to our pet bunny some of its got to go to the trash.	0.0
I would describe it as I want to say lifestyle, even though I don't love that term. It's just a new mentality or a new approach to being in your body, you know, so I have also seen as intuitive eating has become friend here, like people advocating intuitive eating as like the diet where you don't diet and that's so counterproductive to the point of being because it's not a diet and in fact, you cannot practice intuitive eating while also trying to control or intentionally lose weight because as long as you're doing that as long as you are if you can't do it with Weight Watchers, for example, no, Like you like even though they say with Weight Watchers, you could eat whatever you want, but I'll keep ya as long as you're following externalized rules about what you should be eating and tracking your numbers and and having fear around going past a certain point. You'll never be able to actually tune into your body to tell you how much food you really need to feel satisfied. So intuitive eating separates out weight from your health and and really believe that you can be Healthy and you can focus on just practicing Health behaviors without feeling the need to control your weight and that your weight actually is not indicative of your health status.	0.0

it was pretty great. Like I've never really felt that way before it was like probably one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. Yeah. It was really cool because like the volleyball team Adam wanted 15 years and it's like a big milestone just to win again and like I haven't done like a basketball like we haven't won the basketball championship or anything. So it was just really cool.	1.0
Yeah kinda sorta we had picked up because they think like we we laugh about this now but like, you know as they start blowing up and that part when I say, we, you know, we stopped dating and whatever, you know, I've started this is when cell phones is just coming around like it's normal for people who haven't Phone call the number change. So I call them all script like yo her number change. Yeah, she ain't give you the new number his number. I'll call yo. Why don't you be the new number? Oh, I forgot Bubba Bubba that happened like one other time and I was like yo the next time your number change and you don't give me the new number. I ain't calling you no more and the number chanting I and I didn't call her no more and that's how we grow apart. But you know, what's the funny part? One of the funny parts of this story is her homegirl that I just mentioned two weeks before that they would I think they was in Atlanta and she said they would just you know, the girls night Sex in the City whatever and they just got into a random conversation with a homegirl a sir. Who's the one you know, who's the guy that you know you would you feel like got away or that you would marry the drop of a dime and she said me. Is it was okay that it out? So then two weeks later. I'm in a club in a home girls like oh, you know quiche and she called me I was that was the girl is crazy.	1.0
But back, then it's really hard to get and Equipment because it because this point was he angry or just starting you can just get a go online and buy it online that it's really hard or you're gonna import it into States or into the other countries, which is more expensive if we get everyday real ship that right. So you started to train at home how to train at home was very happy. Not really not really right once I got my first bearing bar. That's the again faster. I bought it online from UK. So this is really expensive because I really want to drop the bar. I don't know what well then the problem with the neighbors games like every time I do it at that even doing it after six just in the morning, but of course Every time I drop the bar the floor is shaking. So, you know, you know how it goes and the house is here in Holland the really too close to each other. It's like after you fart the neighbors could hear it. That's how close it is. So yeah try to minimize that and control all my movements. So it's not really that fun. So I tried to kept going more often to open gyms up into the Says and box that were trained off.	0.0

I don't know if that's factual or not. So I'm going to have to back it up with a second source, and of course. It's the only thing those rumors really successfully did was raise the bar to an unobtainable level for the enhancing these Lindor Terry Scott sessions. So now anything that's not a complete highway robbery by the tribe, which the rumors that were out there. Absolutely were you and I have talked in this podcast that we don't know if the Dodgers straight up would do Lindor for Lux and if that was presented to you or I I think I would very strongly consider accepting that offer if I'm the Indians. Yet the offer was Luxe plus six other seven other nine other guys that were really really talented. So and in really nice lot money, of course and really didn't pass the smell test, but it did make for a fun at least 20 minutes or so of taunting you and whether or not I was actually being factual or not because I sent you the tweet and the Tweet went along with the build antonetti a statue Now text which if you receive both you Have understood my sarcasm, but when you didn't get the Tweet part of the text because you're in the air you only got the text message. So then that's initially all you get and then what I what I sent back was another picture. I think I screenshot of the tweet and try to send it to you that way but that also didn't go through and then I said something else which could have been interpreted as they just made this fantastic trade. So I am glad that I at least cause you at least some mild Panic while you're in there.	0.0

I was only 12 and I just remember that's when it happened for me to 12. Yeah. Yeah because I used to be a casual Roman Catholic. Very passionate about God though. I always really felt I always talk about these like bedside moments that I had when I I was a little girl and I really felt a connection to the spiritual and to the Beyond. Yeah, and it wasn't until I was 12 that I went to this Born Again Church. That was Evangelical and you know now looking back I believe that's when I got really messed up and some really toxic thinking and toxic beliefs and fear fear fear fear.	1.0
Ali and I say have something nice to say about Valentina for once she's gone. She got eliminated. No, but like I like the metaphor of that like Miss Universe is very fake great pasta key, so I got that from that.

They would agree that clearly. I mean we have too much of going lately too much of government intervention everywhere. The results are very bad. If you look at it from the point of view of the actual performance of the system to which they to be by academic. Education that economic growth income and wealth distribution as as far as the economy is concerned all these they always screw up right? So you need less of this the problem if you want to turn it back is that it's really it's It's much more difficult than adding a little bit of it to the existing system existing system. So if you have the current system and you have it more government involvement in education, so on a little more that's not a big shake-up for the whole system. It just makes it paralyzed that it a little bit more if you increase taxes a little bit more that's not a big shake-up. So it just makes it marginally more difficult unless you try to turn. Back, we got a problem, especially in the economy. We got a big problem because the economy is so fragile because it is sort of become a Dead junkie but under the influence of monetary interventions in particular. So if you scale back a little bit of this Q fragile eyes and migrate the bankruptcy of certain elements of the economy at this might entail snowboarding effects that have the potential of going on. On all the rest of the economy with that so it's not easy to go. The other direction of I tend to think that as the rule you should think big as you guys are doing apparently because you're raising a big question and you should not be afraid of considering a complete overhaul just cutting a bit from under-20 something like this. I mean certainly the case of money and government spending in the economy. It's on this concert. I think that's definitely a really realistic option.	0.0

So I'm allowing myself to record it again and see how it goes. So yeah, I I wanted to talk a little bit about friendship. You know, I am really selective about who I spend time with because you know, like I've been in recovery now from my eating disorder and like pretty much sober for about 8 months which is less than a human gestation period and it's still really new and it Really new and it takes a lot of work. And so I kind of treat myself with gentleness and acknowledge how much mental real estate this is occupying. It really beats being fully in the disease or in relapse, but you know, I do treat myself. not carefully or gingerly or with kid gloves or anything just with like, you know, just a little more tenderness than I have historically and so yeah, like I might not see a lot of people really often like I shared earlier about how I manage my day and how I only really take on two large chunks of activity a day because any more than that and I just get really anxious and	0.0

Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying like that's that's a few and look at TV Dude TV. Is also like all these Netflix deals that are all these twitch deals that you can stream certain shows on Amazon. That's like the next level because people want to be the content, you know, and I think just viewing the content isn't enough for our brains now just passively watching something you everyone wants to participate in it and Twitches like gaming is the ultimate medium. That's right because it's like a sub entertainment now, you know, it's like weird. It's like you it's chat is responsible for Providing a good stream in some ways. You know, it's like hey, it's a very strange phenomenon was he just did he talk about Twitch in that book or know? So I mean he taught he basically it's a really good book. I suggest everyone reads it but he basically talked about the emergence of like modern entertainment and the sense of like The Simpsons being the one to break the ground basically completely breaking the fourth wall inviting people to participate almost in the sense of like like this is ironic. I'm going to make fun of things in a very ironic way and You know it as an advice like as someone who's smart and pays attention like you can participate in that because only you understand this for reference. And then in the same same stance like Twitches in the live entertainment is the same way like you can under you are able to watch this at this present moment and can participate in it. So he's saying that basically his product prediction is that people will get more and more involved in the content that they consume until it becomes extremely homogeneous, you know. Yeah, it like breaks down the relationship of An audience number until everyone is up on the podium together. You know.	1.0
This week. No, I don't remember this week. I see I am such a fan of the more rumors the better because I can process it. I can I can sift through them and take away from what is reality and what maybe fiction and what is just being put out there and what actually has legs. So if anyone wants to go through the ESPN trade machine and fire up some fake trade that they came up with. I love it. I want to digest it. I just Love trade discussion. I love thinking about what players are worth and rumors are fun. So incarcerated Bob whether he's on he's nailing a rumor or completely off base. I love it. Nonetheless.

Anyways, like it was wicked random. So we again the Uber we're on the way. I remember we were like jamming to like Kanye. He's like new life of Pablo album came out. I was like feeling myself young listening to famous and it was just we are thriving and so then we get there and we wait in line and in line she was like, are you gonna go? When if if I don't get in and vice versa and I was like, well I'm going in like it's her birthday. Yeah, and she was like, you're gonna leave me and I was like, well, I don't know like let's just see if we get in I get in she hasn't. Yeah, he doesn't knock it in I well let's talk to the thing is is my boyfriend went in first because I didn't want him to be involved with like time. Yeah. I didn't want him to be involved and we didn't want to be involved with like The under-21 bullshit right? Because like it's just not cool. And so I was like you go in like get whatever get your coat checked and do you it's the dead of winter. I'm in like a strapless jumpsuit and last time he high heel in Turin is you kind of Wonder I'm isn't though. Like, I don't know. I'm literally walk home. You're like frostbite. You've walked 20 miles and you're just like and you wake up like purple and you don't feel anything like hi. Good morning. Hello. No, so he goes in I go in I turn around she's denied but I'm in okay. So I was and I got in I was like girl didn't I was like, I'm sorry, so she standing out there and I was like, I'll call you an Uber. I had it connected to my Dad's credit card at the time and I was like, I'll call you an Uber and she was like, I don't want an Uber I want to get in and I said well, I don't really know there's nothing I can do so, I don't know how long she stood. Out there, but I went in. It was the year of being a selfless bit like selfish bitch. I just wanted to get him on all you did when you weren't 21. All you wanted to do is get in like you're gonna leave your friends, but it's like hard to even think. I mean, I'm only 20 years but it's so hard to think about when I wasn't 21. Yay. I like don't because you literally had to like fight to get into places or even like pay them. I give them like throw my like, I remember Haley like let me use her. I think it was Haley. Yeah someone let me use their ID one time. Thank God it's it's stressful. Yeah, you got any of like makes it more fun accomplish this massive feat. So like I'm not turning around. Also, I was wasted so like sorry, but then I see a couple of friends from home. I know my friend won't mind if I shut like shout him out his friend. His name is Devon. He he came in he visited he's a Ellie stop eating the bed. All right. We met we need to sell your bed. Yeah, we need to do a lot of things. We need to train her Ellie. Don't lay on the phone. Okay, so she'll lay right here. She'll hang out all that her belly. So then I take photos with him. He was living in San Francisco at the time. He he's a flight attendant for I think United. Yeah United and so, you know, I was just so happy to see him. I was so happy to be with my friends. I was so excited. And I got completely wasted like Beyond life my boyfriend at the time went to the bathroom. He was gone for maybe three minutes. Like I don't really know he could have been gone longer and I just thought he like I don't know what happened. I thought he was gone for hours. He wasn't though and he was like Andrea. I literally just went to the bathroom. It's time to go home. It was like 1:30 in the morning Nicki Minaj was playing. People were twerking. It was just getting wild and people weren't working. I know and I never I never learned how to twerk. Like I'm either I like tried, but which is Barren because I've been like a dancer and cheerleader. I should know how to do that. But I should have Kaylee come on in like give an example or like give up a step by side Kaylee green. She teaches teachers teach you how to twerk. I need that I've other friends I can talk to and I just like can't like, you know what that's actually a lie. I use when twerking was for a school. I definitely get to work and now I'd like got old and I can't anymore. I'm just if I break a hip same so hey, I'll I'll finish my story so real quickly. So Taylor can get onto hers, but we leave we're in an Uber I of course get the spins. I don't really remember why but I was like, I'm gonna fucking puke and so then we get out of the car. We're on Comm Ave for like by bu I get out of the car my ex gets out of the car and he's like bitch. What the fuck and he's horrified Ellie. Does he growl at you know, she was trying to play you were trying to play. It's okay baby, and she and I rip off my seven-inch heels like stilettos like it was not a drill. I pulled him off like they weren't going back on then. There and he the minute he saw my heels coming off. He was like God damn it. She's down for the count like eventually, you know, we call multiple Ubers multiple cabs. They won't let us in because I'm blind different and being probably psychotic and cops show up and they're like, hey, what are you guys doing? And I don't know why this is the first thing my underage self decided to say, but I was like, I'm not	0.0

Have you seen the cats trailer is Tom have you it's like an absolute Abomination I can use this movie for it's like a parody doesn't make any sense. It's like as if someone made a movie within a movie that was supposed like it's like yeah, like it's like you're watching a movie like here's the shitty movie Hollywood made and they showed a clip from cat. Should be like in Tropic Thunder like one of those movies is the stupidest thing. Yeah, it looks like I don't even understand it. I don't understand. Why is the first CGI? Why can't they just wear cat bodysuits? Like on the the stage play? I don't fucking understand when I was a kid. I went to that.	0.0

No, I agree. He's just really Limited in the coverage and it's one of those things where Taylor rap is a player where you're taking a high floor with a not much higher. Doing so it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Yeah, you're right. He would kind of solidify the position and he wouldn't be bad but he wouldn't be amazing. It would just be solid and I guess that's worth something but that's not what I'm looking for here. This offense needs Playmakers specifically, I would love Deonte Thompson here. I think that that's a good pick I wouldn't be upset at they took Deonte Thompson 44. I think it's great value specifically considering what he does. He's got legitimate concerns about some of the facts facets of his game one Thornhill. Would be a fantastic selection here as well. He's also got legitimate concerns, but I think that he's going to be a solid selection, but I'm looking at Marquis Brown. I know that I know that he does not fit their traditional receiver, but I do think that that could change a little bit this year with Matt LaFleur the home it's tough to get on board with Marquis Brown because of the lisfranc injury and just how small he is but Man, when you turn on the tape, he is electric and it's just so much fun to watch and to think about what he would provide this not only does offense, but the Special Teams unit Depot Samuel is a close second in that department. He didn't he could just do so many different things and Kelvin Harmon is just solid, you know, you're getting a good receiver of Kelvin Harmon. So I'm good with any any of those five.	1.0
He's awesome. And he's a real ability though. If it is something that he's really showing off a little bit more this year some of the haters and he's got a couple of them this year. We very rarely get what balls into the box I deliver.	1.0
This week daylight savings has been kicking our butts. So we have had a lot of just morning meltdowns this week of really like we had I don't know if Elise was ever like this but we have had he doesn't like to wear socks because I don't like to wear socks. Yeah, it's a sensory thing, but I also don't like to wear socks and I don't I don't I don't promote socks in the summer and she always wears like natives usually don't wear socks because they're perforated and my mom gets so mad at me because she thinks that their room Her heels anyway off topic there. Um, but it's the other day. She came out with a summer dress on and it was strawberries all over it. She's like I'm wearing this to school and I'm like, well, how do you want? It's like 20 degrees outside. Yeah, we got to wear tights we get tights on her and then it was just like the World War 3 with the seam in the thing in the boot and the we couldn't make it work. So finally like she's like in the living room no clothes on. She's like, I'm not going to school today. This is Aeolus and I'm like, well, you have to go to school one. So then we're trying to be logical. I'm like, well you like to go down the flagpole at school. So if you don't wear tights you have to your legs gonna get really cold on the flagpole. Yeah, and you can get hurt like you could get frostbite or something. So what finally be like agreed to pants and a shirt but it's like whoo buddy, like the sock thing is a challenge for us right now. So today I Center in glit like some glittery looking Ugg boots. What does it we don't have to wear socks because they're furry on the inside. So compromised. Yes, that's good. Gravy, how about you?	0.0

But where I was going with something more specific which is how does retailer 103 benefit from the hundred to retailers that you already have. You've got all this data around these audio. What's that company's name? Jjolbodyo. Jjolbodyo is customers, right, you know the names of the customers, you know, their purchase frequency, you know their usage frequency. And so if you get the third Audio company signing on to sandbox, can we cross marker two different customer bases? Can we say? And across different an economist lie, and and that's where I think it becomes really defensible and really valuable is if we can if we can say to the thousandth customer you benefit from the 999 other customers that already signed on the network effect of the data and the but the ability to provide even our existing retailers with automated information about the data, you know on a recurring basis, huh? But it's Daniels vision of the of the network effect is	1.0
Absolutely.

So I think I thought about this one and that there's two things that I want to say is that the first one is mine. I did touch on it before but when I was going through a by period in my business having to look at different income streams for staging so I created my packages and my style to stay service. So that was the first one and the second one and I think backup touched on this in her interview was that I had these staged a property and owner came back and said we had left scuffs all up and down the hall. We didn't and he never came back to me about it, but it was putting in a process of actually photographing the property before we even put Furniture into it so that we have evidence of anything that could go wrong afterwards. Yeah, that's it.	0.0
Oh, I was just going to ask you to like, what do you think about Titans? I know that they had in there like a some in their file. Files they had tried it and they said it didn't work.

I'm sure private you are so I want you to run through all of your races this year because just What kind of rice no with you but of wrong with you, it was run different events at the same main event and it would appear that I've taken weekends off and you've raced every weekend that's it seems to me so it seems like a year of writing. Well not quite every weekend. But yeah, I'm not a fan of taking time off. I just do as I said things. The fall off when I do that, but I did tell her we're in my life in February this year. I did the I do that with Carl and I did the Brisbane Valley real Colonel Marlowe this year, which I did last year and last year and I actually collapsed a few hundred meters from the finish it my body went into shock, but I've made it I made it to the end with 20 minutes to spare. So I made it I think. 29 hours 40 minutes and this year I finished third third be mailing or just over 21 hours. So I learned a lot from that from last year. I was going to climb so high this year, but it got cancelled. So I did my own bun a high of 50 around being on the same day. So if quote century and soon at your Mantra and a couple of other smaller ones as well, I've done the see that we were traveling series most of that this year and yeah.

They're the biggest Lights I've ever seen they create they create like Son basic, right and he bought three of them and I guess the invested all his money into those. They're still doing great right now. Redmond is basically long story short. That was they didn't have money to pay us anymore. So guess what head on the chopping block number to yank?	1.0

So as things go along I am solely scrolling through right now. And the big thing right now is Kyla Marie didn't go number one. and so with our pick We do have Brian Burns out there. Both Iowa tight ends out there DK Metcalf is the currently the highest rated player out there for this one as long with along with Devin Bush.	1.0
Maybe off that Saturday too. That's the Saturday before that's like a week before he three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah might have to look into that man through true.	1.0
Yeah, so I have another question about your training. So you spend a fair bit of what I know about you spent your run by feel you don't really tape up but and you somewhere along the line you recover. I don't know how so you've obviously got a bit of a Natural disposition or maybe just from years of running until dropping pretty decent base, but do you ever have any major troubles with the engines?	1.0
I'm a long runs and 60 minutes and felt this sharp pain at the fucking before foot. It didn't go away for Around yep, their messages are away and godly fear in the worst.	0.0

I I totally agree and I think it's so yeah like the loose just great and all the places that you need to go to. Later, as you're moving towards the circle is just it's perfect. It just lines itself up. Yeah, we're definitely all right.	1.0
Exactly and I think we can all see that mother nature is more powerful and strong more strong than any of us, you know, you'd allowed and I love hunting and I hunt a lot in the Northwest is if I can and if we have time and you'll see that on certain years when we go elk hunting you'll look in the the cow elk. Have a lot of calves on them and it looks like everything's good. Not the populations good and then the next year, you're like, oh boy. This doesn't look good. I hardly see any cabs and and this and that and I of course there's a there's a whole host of reasons for that. You know, you got the Predators and all that jazz, but then probably some of it is the is the mother. Yeah how well they got bread back by the Bulls, you know, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah a lot of variables that play into it.	0.0
That's where a lot of the circular thinking and rumination comes from so sometimes I just let it out and it just makes it a lot. Better but yeah, so what I had to sort of assume like the first baby step I took in this entire Enterprise of like human decency and I city is that I just like pretended as if people cared about my response like I used to be the king of being like, oh, you know just fine Kelly and you know, whatever like tired or like.	1.0

Do we only talk on Snapchat or like is that like our main form of communication then like I'll be at work. Send you a cute little nude at work like you saved one, but like during the day you look for it or um, there have been a lot of needs taken in my work bathroom. I'm just saying there's right. There is like a mirror like behind and in front at my work so like you can take a really cute like but shot. Are you not dressed at work? Do you not like take your pants down when you pee I don't know.	1.0

I know I'm loving it. I'm so glad you all enjoyed it and it's super interesting for me to hear about the connections with behavior because I do think there's like a primal element to intuitive eating that is hard to understand cognitively.

No, I agree. I had as much as I like do the young receivers like slate and Boykin and even Wesley little bit the Packers young receivers. I want to see what they can do this year. And we've already taken Debo Samuel off the board. So I think another you offensive lines the way to go. They do need to fortify it. McGovern's he's going to be a steady player. I think he's going to be a solid player for a long time. And I think that you'd and plus drafting a pure interior offensive linemen will help because years past we've always have two tackles and shifted him in. I think drafting a guy who's been a guard before gives him a little bit of that extra Edge when they come into camp and let you learn the intricacies right away. And so yeah, let's make Connor McGovern The Pick and so just a few more pics is till we get to our gift from the Washington Redskins at pick 118 and there goes miles Boykin right off the bat. So the three picks between McGovern and the current one Justin Hollins from Oregon goes to the Panthers miles Boykin to the Dolphins again because they take everyone that we want and Joe. Jackson of Miami goes to the Falcons So now top guys on the board Josh all over still out there from San Jose State. Jajuan Johnson from Miami Darius. Slaton Antoine Wesley. Treyvion Williams, Jacoby Myers Dennis daily Marquis Blair from Utah Ronnie Anderson from Oklahoma and Demarcus Lodge from Mississippi are the top guys on the board will further down the Border guys, like will Grier Terry Godwin Titus Howard Jared Stidham still on the board a little bit further down house Gaskins still down there as well, but There's still some good names out. There is still some good prospects for pick 118.	1.0

Storage is an issue. So attending the Symposium recently instead need hearing the storage company get up on stage and talk about how they can offer all these things to stages. Like we just don't have any of that down here and I'm sure in a lot of regional areas don't have that access. So storage is quite expensive down here removalists are expensive. So I've been lucky to find a couple of guys who do Up me, they're not a furniture removal us as such with the truck, but they are very good to me and they do look after my friend nature when we are moving it. But also the biggest challenge that I've found is is actually educating people about what home staging actually is in the area when I first started right at home staging II overheard my dad telling someone what right at home staging was all about and he got it completely wrong, so I had to tell my parents It's like basically gave them a script on what home staging does so and to this day I still find it's an education piece with everybody on home staging and how it can benefit them when they're selling their home, which is a very yeah, I agree and it's it could be quite difficult because you not only selling yourself.	0.0

But I always I feel like it's so much fear because I remember feeling I remember being on the opposite side of that I could see myself introducing someone as a non-Christian back in the day, not tomorrow. Yeah, but I was I love God so much and I have for so long that if anyone didn't have that and then and then when I can Christian church or an Evangelical Church when they're pounding into our heads like you said, this is your identity. This is the thing that gives you purpose. This is where true happiness. Flies I just felt sad for people that didn't have that. I wanted them to have like salvation. And then when I was even younger I was so scared of everyone going to hell. I was like, oh God, I love Nicole so much.

Like there are so many positive benefits that we get from moving our bodies and the second you make exercise about either a punishment for something you ate or simply for the pursuit of weight loss. It just takes the fun away and if we just remove that from the equation and treated exercise as a celebration of what your body we can do in a celebration of having the ability to even move your body, which is also just a privilege in and of itself how would shift your relationship to movement like, what would you do differently? You know, I also see people thinking like we live in like the no pain no gain culture right where it's like people think that you need to feel depleted and exhausted and like you can't move after snack Orangetheory. Yeah, right like okay calling them out, but it's true.

Yes. We can hear you loud and clear loud and clear.	1.0
My players got excited about it. I was excited about it.	1.0
So what did they do with this?	1.0
Very much is not child that authors hear me. I think it can work for a long time depends on the conditions also depends on how people act what what people will do it can act because we have very smart managers at the top of central banks who know the business, you know, what they can do if they cannot do we have generation of politicians who have enough equal. Reconstruction so that they know where they cannot exaggerate it with helping themselves through the printing press. All right, so there's some minimal discipline there. That's and they want to use really the printing press right now to be in Revenue. We're not at that point. Once you're at that point, then you're close to hyperinflation of closer columns, right? There was for example the situation in Germany after World War one and when they had huge public debt deficits for five years in a row, I mean Really huge and eventually, they just need the printing press to get the revenue because the taxes were no longer sufficient. Now even though President Trump has made some very considerable efforts in that direction of the huge deficit in the US as well. But nowhere near the situation which they would truly do need the printing press right right now they can help sell some of the current market. So as long as these conditions Prevail, I don't think we're anywhere near So drun finish stop stop of the this can last for a longer time, but he can't last indefinitely. Yeah, definitely.	0.0

We like text about like, you know, just like to give each other affirmations and all that stuff and with them it's really different, but I wanted to talk a little bit about how to really ask how someone's doing because we're so unused to it and I certainly was really, you know, I was like a foal trying to walk. It was just all like you know, like shifting weight awkwardly like buckling under certain pressures and all this stuff and When you ask how someone's doing and they're like, oh, you know the same, you know, same same tired like everyone else and they move you along.	0.0
We're not going to be happy Indians fans Indians for an office to I would venture to say that that's probably the takeaway that they have if they want to go draft day. They put a note in their pocket and it says Gavin Lux or nothing walk away and so I I have a certain faith in their ability in these negotiations to be able to walk away because we've seen in the past they They stick to their guns on this this sort of thing. They very rarely will meet you too far in the middle. They'll make trades. They think are fair and I don't know if they're necessarily trying to go out there and and Rob anybody but they have in their mind what they think is fair value in return for their guys. And if you're not willing to match it unless it's a situation where they're losing the player at the end of the year or the player doesn't really factor into their plans. They're prepared to just say no. Thanks and keeping Francisco. Lindor is one hell of a Secondary prize and I could argue is probably the first prize but as you've laid out before you've written we've discussed in this podcast the last week. If you do hold on to them, then you better you better make that worth it. You need to make that move count for something because once once you pass this winner and you the season starts to me, it's like a car driving on a brand new car driving off the lot the minute it does that the value has declined a bunch and lens or anything. Your cars, no kidding the luck. I have and Lindor is a I mean you're already starting with the value that is through the roof. So even if you're treating him for one year, you would give back something useful, but you're not going to get back. Somebody's top prospect like Gavin Lux, that's not happening. If you trade him. I think if you go through the end of this offseason and you hold on to him you can wave goodbye to anyone getting anyone close to that level.	0.0

But for the most part it should be about cleaning surfaces and I do have a minimalist approach, although right now, I feel like I don't have enough stuff in my living room because when I first decorated my living room when we moved in, Had put a small plant stand below a picture just to kind of balance out a certain wall and I put a plant there, but now I ended up moving that because people kept bumping bumping it and it was just kind of flimsy and then now they have something else set sitting on top of it. I think it's the modem or something like that and they have it moved over by the TV.	1.0

So the other day, I'm at Sacramento muhittin hip and kind of making shoot forward and had a little bit of a different day that bull usually right there to the right. You like he'll go like a round or two right there to the right in the gate and then he'll jump forward and go back a left generally, but the other day, like I said, he hit he hit his hip and made him shoot forward and then he kind of had a kind of a I don't know. I didn't love these is move before I turn back. But once you turn back then he was fine. But yeah that hit so that will Omaha. I like him. He's a good boy, but he came from a friend of ours up in Oregon a guy named Rusty Gorham raised that boy. So the in their sure proud of them Rusty and Lisa are real proud of that bull. So that's cool. Cool for that deal back here. $3,500 will 10 Bingham was like 93 on them at Kennewick or something. Wasn't he? Right? Yeah. Yeah at Puyallup at the yeah. Yeah, and then his brother Tyler at Spring Road. The only time that Bulls been rode the last couple of years. Other than that the PBR deal, but Tyler Kimball throat. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Hi, you know good good good boy, the 93 I think was a stretch that was quite a bit of points. But but but he's a good-good bull and in back to our point is for for what works for our business and and I'm not saying that works for everybody. But for what we're doing it, it works better for us just to buy the both, you know, so I can see the guys that raise them like the pages I watched. They're Bulls at Sacramento. Watch what they do on the sales. And if not and how they do their their their business and I can see why they do what they do. It works. They block like hell and they sell it for lots of money. So they're doing they do you know what works for them? That's good for exactly. What so what about to you can kind of answer this in the two-part question but like us fraternity guys and stuff what kind of segregate our bulls and stuff and then I take it rodeoing, you know, it's um rodeos may have ample amounts of pain some may not Are they are they just in general population like at your house? And then how many how many trips a year roughly. We you put on a bull? Well, the first the first part of your question is is you nailed it. There's there's a lot there's rodeos have the facility that to split them up pretty good. But then there's a lot of a lot of rodeos at don't have that, you know the kind of facilities. You need to split them up a whole bunch. I'll tell you how I try and make them live. And and you guys being bull guide, you know that there's sometimes you just can't make mixes. There's some mixes that just don't work. They just don't like each other. We know we all know that kind of force them through it and get them to get along but for us how I try and do it as I pay them how they fit on a truck. So in a cattle pot sets of 6 is I got using I got a couple sets of fours or like a set of for a set of three got to be the nose and the back step and then sets Six is on the top, you know the top and the bottom decks. So and then that also fit for the pins that we have in our house, you know, we have pins that are about all half acre lots maybe from half an acre to maybe one acre lot and and that's plenty of room for them.	1.0

I can't fix any of this no matter what you do and I think that's where anxiety gets tricky for people like us it's because it's like you can't fix it. Like when your dad was going through that there's there's nothing you can do and feeling powerless hmm to somebody like us who is very Very successful at fixing things.

And the tail is heavily muscled and extremely powerful and that's shown with the office the the alpha skulk are lifted and flung Kong like a football across the lake with his tail and as stated before that the tail is also for wrapping around large prey possibly to latch onto them for balance or to constrict them. And it's called crawlers are Subterranean Predators with insatiable appetites that are that are the result of their height and metabolisms. They are both solitary and pack Hunters one can kill a big buffalo on its own and they can cooperate to take down more powerful creatures such as calm and being some training and nature skull crawlers are capable of using their limbs to burrow deep into the Earth and they seem to have mostly mostly a primal mindset and they are highly aggressive so practically hostile As well as incredibly persistent in pursuing their prey. They do have however show some degree of intelligence shown when the skull devil the largest of the skull crawlers with refuses to devour somebody armed With Grenades and simply swats a person away school colors are very are very durable as they can withstand bullets from rifles and even the Searing heat from a flamethrower and the alpha skull crawler was only dazed when calling slammed his head with a boulder or smashed his face with a tree branch and they have incredible. More stamina because they're able to stay in a full-fledged fight for several minutes. Even while being incredibly injured and the skull crawler appear to be actually more intelligent than the others and this was seen and this received because he appeared only ones calling was subdued and it all and and its colors possess possess accelerated metabolism, which causes them to live in constant constant starvation, and this is shown when the skull devil ravenously tried to eat neither and refuse to let go of Congress arm and calm down turned his appetite. Against it did tearing out its tongue and other internal organs and had it often and had it let go it would have in fact survive as Congress holding Weaver and adults colors tongue. Now, I'm going to say to say what their role was in the film. It's called crawler was stirred. It was first seen feasting on on a dead squirrel Buffalo by Kong and called was about to confront the creature when he was ambushed by a second skull crawler after a lengthy battle called it Kong ends up subduing and killing both skull crawlers by Smashing one skull with a devastating Stomp and the other by stuffing its head into the ground breaking its neck. And another skull crawler ambushed Jack Chapman and a Spore mantis, but I went for Chapman and ate him alive while the sport management mantis managed to escape and that same and that very same skull crawler. Then showed up in the Boneyard and regurgitated Chapman's remains and this was actually normal behavior because the because the skull crawler wasn't being sick. It was just getting rid of the indigestible stuff and when William Randa attempted to make his camera work, he was devoured by it and he then it and then tried to attack the	0.0

My identity was wrapped in my virginity that was definitely an aspect of it as well. Yeah, so like and then when I wasn't a virgin anymore and even when I was married, I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know what made me a good. Person anymore because that's all I was like, that's all I heard about. What a good person is a good person is a virgin. Well, yeah. Yeah, it's a disaster. So my Christian advice to anyone in countering any theist or someone that simply doesn't believe the same things or God forbid a Christian that actually believes different things than you two just like trust the Holy Spirit if you believe in God you Proclaim to like believe that Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit puffs. Faith that like everyone is on their own journey and everyone's going at their own rate.	0.0

So yeah, so I started a job as a editor for one of the local TV station to CBS affiliate here in sorry. No the ABC affiliate here in Salt Lake and I went to the CBS affiliate here in Salt Lake won an Emmy was some of the with a piece that I did that at some point. I'll put a link out there. So you guys can all see it and at that point I realized I'm like, you know, what I've had enough of news could probably actually also do an entire episode on what it's like working in local TV station. I think we could probably we could probably find a really good guest to come on to talk about any cool. All sorts of people, that'd be interesting. That would be a good one news is a particularly rough filled and so once I had made a five-year plan at that point to once I was in news, I'm like, okay, I'm new to this and it is I'm going to get an Emmy. I'm going to get out and because I knew that Amy could help give me other jobs and it has which it has which was the next job which is doing video production for a marketing company, which is actually where Drew and I met I still work there currently do some freelance as well on the side and thinking about what does the future look like for me?

A question that I wanted to know and I think it's probably going to be different for every Rodeo guy. But what you said you buy most of your Bulls are all of them what you just bought some seen some dummy trips on what are you looking for? I mean, you know, you're not you're not competing with them. It doesn't sound like so what's the few quality traits that you really looking for in a good one? Well well Oh guys look at the air and kick and spin but then for for me that that I guess that's I like speed. I you know might Corey and I always round and round about this because you know, I like I said a little bit ago Mike Corey and I are good buddies and bikes been at Northwest bull man for years and and he's in the break over Bulls. He likes bulls that that break over and old knock your job. You don't hang around you've been hanging around on kiss so long, you got the same flavor. He does with the speed a little bit when they have that intensity and speed all I know I like him to kick. I'm not gonna happen. But you know, but you do look at you do look at this.

You can't organize clutter. There might be some junk down there that you just never use. We really only need so many products.

If you're not going to use it. Maybe pass it on to a friend or family member or just toss it depending on what it is.	0.0

Another more old-fashioned way would be just a bottle that has a little bit of like a bleach and water solution. But yeah, I would rather use like a shower spray that the smell isn't as harsh.

How did that come about that came about when my son was two something happened one night when I came home from work that made me question whether growing up without a father had crept into my father Hood, which is something I never thought about, you know, because I have two other kids, you know, two daughters and so that you know, I was kicking around the idea. That year. I think I kind of rolled out some chapters and I just didn't get to it, you know, and then like a few years ago. I just like I just really need to get this out. So I started writing to explore this question. Like I did Growing Up Without a father creep into my fatherhood and you know halfway through I felt like maybe my story could be a Thule inspiration to others that have similar backgrounds. The things that nature or maybe I don't know maybe it can help. So I you know, I finished finished the book. I decided to self-publish it which is crazy not the recommended thing. But um, you know, and I put it out there and I think you know, it's really getting it was a great run to have those conversations amongst men and women but specifically amongst men within our community about fatherhood and and the responsibilities of the mail, you know, and I black families and it I actually was inspired because a lot of solid father's out there's a lot of young Brothers is you know, they they don't have all the money in the world.

Yeah, that was terrible.

Okay. Yeah. She's shading the other teams for not having it look nice. Right, but but there's the concept ended up being not as strong as the other one trunks doesn't look nice, but they do well. I'm usually drunk when I go in there so and then Naomi ended up fronting most of the work because like Valentina wasn't helping like write the scripts and she was kind of like joking on joking around while they were trying to like paint the set which is funny to watch but then you're thinking like if I was Naomi I would be I would probably be more like tents and visibly nervous. Because I would be like no dude. We need to get this props to her for like kind of caring that team. I feel like Valentina and I went back into her old because she'd kind of the same thing last her season when she wasn't like studying the words like she kind of just coasted through it and that what's in her home.

What are some things that are acceptable today by the world that is So beating it to God or that's exposing like are weak faith in God, right? Because sir, I in chapter 16 verse 3 sir. I took matters into her own hands by giving hag are to her husband Abraham, right her weak faith in God. She said God has prevented me from having children. She had trouble believing God's promise like Abraham in chapter 12, right, which says let's go back to chapter 12. God said God. I mean God told him that are I'm sorry. No in chapter 12 when he goes to Egypt and is like look you are a very beautiful woman. He says this to Sarai when the Egyptian see you they will say this is his wife. Let's kill him. And we can have her so please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life in treat me well because of their interest in you. So here's the thing Abraham's lack of faith that God would protect him. He took matters into his own hands write and tell Sarah to act as his sister and it creates all these problems while they're in Egypt same thing with Sarah when she took matters into her own hands because she had trouble believing God's promise out of this lack of Faith came a series of problems now. I want you to think of our your life or I'm thinking of my life right now how this happens when we take over for God right trying to make his promises come true through efforts that are not in line with his specific directions. Sometimes God gives us a promise. Sometimes we hear God calling us like, okay like	1.0

I got a call about my son's speech. Meaning and how they're like, well we can see and go through this process and it didn't like you want them to be good kids and you want them to be healthy and but yeah, then what if something is not quite right? How do you fix it? And I think the other thing with anxiety that I've kind of noticed just from other people in my life is I don't know exactly how to say it but like a lot of times people are anxious because they don't have a job. Job, or they don't have money, but you can't like you need resources and you need help but it takes money to have those resources. I know and so like just yesterday. So my sons having a really hard time at drop off still and it's it's a lot and so I contacted this place and they're like, oh we're out of network. It's going to be like three hundred fifty dollars for the screening and you know, so it's like, okay. I'm trying to deal with this thing. I'm trying to You know, I'm trying to do the right things, but I can't spend $500 on a problem that lasts 5 minutes in the morning, you know, so I think that's the other thing that's tricky about mental health is that first of all, you have to want to get help because I don't know how many people I've tried to help and if they don't want to get better sure they can't they're never going to get better. But even people that do want help sometimes it's it's hard financially to to get the help that you need.	0.0

Oh, well, I help people become better versions of themselves. And so my occupation is a personal trainer personal trainer for California Family Fitness in Sacramento, but I don't really just look at myself as a trainer. I look at myself as a life coach kind of someone who has more of a therapeutic side. It not just physical. It's not just exercise but it's more about your daily decisions more about your habits. It's more about just trying to become a better version than what you were yesterday just baby steps. So just me being on the sidelines trying to help people coach them Mentor them to be better than they were is an absolute blessing and tell us.	1.0
Want to lose 10 pounds or more for most people it's toning losing body fat. Just being yeah, I would say that like more body composition wanting to and you know, 80% of all clientele are females. And so if you think about after pregnancy, if you think about how females invest in their lashes their nails their plastic surgery everything their hair, you know, they invest in their bodies and so but with males is a little different because you know, we go through Sports we have friends that we hang out with that we all gym and like Sigmund Freud said it like most males the reason why we exercise So it's sex-related. So he says like the reason why people want to drive fast cars are the reason why they want to buy nice shoes of the reason why they want to dress a certain way is because they want to attract other people. It's like something called pheromones. So yeah, it's very very interesting. So he says a lot of the decisions that we actually make the color that we want the body that we want or the kind of house or car or job. You know, there is kind of like sex-based kind of Interest Is pretty interesting, you know, but anyway back to Just Fitness and itself being a trainer for the past four years has saved my life it gave me a sense of purpose and I've dealt with a lot of drug addiction to the past and also dealt with you know, just finding my own security and life but personal training kind of just fell into my lap and it allowed me to do something greater than myself. So it was nice and Growing up are going to college you didn't study to be a nosy right now. I wanted to do a first, you know, I wanted to be a doctor but I didn't want to be a doctor. It was something that my parents wanted me to do. Yeah, you know and then as I started realizing what I really wanted to do, I just kind of went with my own instincts. There's that Jim Carrey thing that he said where ya know you can either live your life doing something that you kind of like doing and fail at that. Or you can live your life and do something that you love right and fail at that like at least go out with doing something that you love because you know, he talked about his dad and his dad just you know wasn't really living happy lives. Thanks for trying to find, you know purpose like what really drives you what gives you fulfillment in life. It's really just about service. It's about what you're doing for other people. That's what gives you like the most Joy before you're doing Fitness.	1.0

Yeah. Well this your it's going to take you about 20 hours or so, I think yeah, I mean Yeah, what's crazy? What about the camera in particular? I remember and you probably remember to in Dark Souls 3 the camera of when they're you're like facing two bosses was always kind of annoying and I was like, well, I don't know how I'd fix it. You know like this is what are you supposed to do if there's to moving objects that you're supposed to keep on the screen. It's kind of impossible to fix but then this game for some reason it doesn't have that same issue. And even though there's like seven or eight enemies on the screen for some reason. I don't think about it. It's almost as if like the game was made with the intention of the camera as well, you know, like as a mechanic versus like making a level making a boss and then having a camera there like that's sort of what Dark Souls kind of fell into but it's true.	1.0

What do you typically do but they might think that you should go through that. My thing is just showing patience, you know, Transformations don't happen overnight and I think for me, it's just trying to challenge them in their weak areas and just keep them accountable drink more water. Like a lot of people don't drink enough water dude for females out there track your water intake at least 90 fluid ounces of water or two-thirds of your body weight and for males you want at least a hundred twenty fluid ounces or two-thirds of your body weight. So a lot of people when they train and I asked how much water they have. They're hella tired in the beginning and I asked how much water in there like I haven't had any water. I just had my coffee right and then if you're if you're sleeping for six to eight hours, you're not having any water then we wake up you go pee you have coffee you have you haven't had water for 10 12 hours possibly and then you try to work out and do cardio and less weights your guests 70% of your muscle is water that you need water. So that's number one. One two, I'll try to help them. Tell them to get a little more rest if they can because that's a big thing. But you know, if they slip I think it from me. I've learned that it's better just to keep showing positive encouragement instead of trying to tear them down. You know, it's kind of like parenting and you don't want to tear people down.	1.0

So anything kind of what you're saying to you like if you're Having you know a lot of anxiety and you're just not feeling great. I kind of like to say you have to give yourself a fighting chance. So I mean I noticed when I'm eating really poorly and I'm not working out and I'm just like I guess what's one more pint of ice cream and that's me and hurt me and Fountain Coke. Yeah, like you just you just feel like gross and I think I kind of made the decision last week and then of course, I got my wisdom teeth out this week. So I've kind of been knocked down but um, I'm Like you know what? Okay, I I'm probably never going to be the same size. I was before I had kids and that's fine. And but I need to give myself the best chance that I can so I'm going to drink water. I'm going to exercise even if like 30 minutes. And so last year I did an Ironman Triathlon, which released 1.2 miles Swim 56-mile Bike and then a half marathon. So for me to sit here and go. Oh, I'm going to walk for 30 minutes. It's like kind of like a In the face to myself because it's like are you kidding me right now? Like you just did this a tower of n but that's what I can do right now. And so that's what I'm going to do. And those little habits are going to build on top of each other and then you're going to get stronger and grow and yeah, and so I think part of it too is you have to give yourself the best possible shot that you can but that kind of brings up like self-sabotage. I know I do that. I'm so good at that where it's like, you know, I'll do a way. Weight loss challenge or something and I'll get so close, but I'm like, I'm not going to make it so I'm just gonna gain ten pounds anyways, and like why do I do that?	1.0

So score was 1:1 towards the end of the first half and Josh something happened in the box there didn't look like it was a ton of contact, but you went down and were down for a while with an injury and I can tell you standing next to You your parents and other people on the sidelines there were some worried people over on the sidelines both one for your health. But also then if you couldn't return that would be a big loss for the team can tell us about what happened there. And yeah, so basically like this kid earlier on the game he went for like a slide tackle and that's when I went down on my shoulder. Like that's when it started to hurt a lot and then later on another kid like hit me in the shoulder and that's when I went down in the box. So so you set off for the rest of the Half did come back in the second half and then I don't know 15 minutes, maybe into the second half you took a shot from just outside the box that the fans over on our side line were ready to cheer and explode in excitement and then it hit the crossbar. So what were you thinking on that chat do you think was going in? I thought I was going to go in because I put like I hit a knuckleball and it was moving and the keeper couldn't do much. I felt bad. Yeah, I was gonna ask you. What was your feeling when it crossbar pretty bad? Yeah. Thankfully we were able to still maintain our composure there and then Auggie you got a penalty kick late in the game there then end up being the game-winner. There were some Chestertown fans and the calvary players and some of their fans to kind of yelling at the keeper trying to give them instructions as to which way you were going to go. Did you hear them at all? What were you thinking when you stepped up to the Penalty spot there?	1.0

Okay. Sorry, some of us have to wake up in the morning and earn bread for kids and my family. Okay, wait, we have to attain the wheat? Okay, the grain. Yeah. Well we have to so sorry. I have to wake up early at the peak of Dawn and Star Wars is just out for two days. You've been playing it for two days. Okay, so that happened yesterday. What's the excuse for the weeks before?	1.0

I guess he let him grow maybe no who just I don't cut them I cut my son's toenails but wife takes care of I don't like talking about toenails skeeves me out. It is gross especially when it's that my son's toenails are really gnarly. Yeah, I just got weirded out.	0.0

Yeah. So so you go or he dropped it joint so somebody I'm gonna listen to the rest of this and then we'll talk about that next episode. But in that man, that's it has been in line town. Episode 18. We appreciate everybody that continue to listen to us again on your favorite platforms. We appreciate all the support. We are going to keep everything going and and we do not have a a secure name yet. But I think an anime podcast is brewing with some other members of g.

And again, we wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for y'all. So again, I appreciate everybody and I can't say that enough. Other than that man flocking on any final words before we close this out.	1.0
Right and the Indians could prey on that because they could just say well we'll keep them. He's a perennial All-Star will keep him for two years. We don't have to trade him to you but along those lines I'm also Thinking it's only a matter of time before another team gets in the mix or is leaked to be in the mix because that just drives it up even more. You know, if the Dodgers insist they don't want to include Gavin Lux. Well, then the Indians can leak to someone and say hey we've talked to the Atlanta Braves or the Cincinnati Reds or another team about a Lindor trade and and then maybe the Dodgers get a little more desperate. But you know, I also think having just I'm Just going to completely debunk everything. I just said I also think front office's don't fall for that stuff the way we all do media fans the public, you know, I think they have a pretty good grasp of what's really going on. And yes, they do pay attention to trade rumors and and National reporters and whatnot. But you know that they use that to check on things to get what the legitimate scoop is and not necessarily what's out there. So it's going to be interesting. You're right. You know how desperate to the Dodgers get do they really feel like Gavin Lux can be as good as Francisco Lindor and more importantly do they feel like he can be as good as Lindor right now. I don't know but I mean you look up and down that roster and there's like 15 to 20 guys. I'd have interest in if I was if I were the Indians, I mean, there are so many directions they could go but you probably need Lux in the deal to feel comfortable because this isn't just this isn't just like Find the best match and let's do it. This is overwhelm us enough that we feel comfortable going to ownership and convincing them to sell their franchise face of the franchise and you know, probably sacrifice some season ticket sales and some fan sentiment knowing that hey you might be a better team and you'll certainly be a better team long-term Beyond 20/20 one. But like this is going to sting even if you get a really good return even if you quote unquote win the The trade and all the people who love to get a handout letter grades 10 seconds after a trade happens for some reason, you know, you're even if you win those and you get an A-Plus like it's still going to hurt at the Ballpark at in the ticket office. So you're going to have to be overwhelmed. That's why I think Lux probably has to be in the deal no matter what even if you to a mean like in a vacuum like Dustin may + Alex Verdugo + Chris Taylor plus Joc Pederson Plus Like Max Muncie is an amazing Hall. But like I still think I still think it's got to be Luxe. I still think you need that Marquee slam-dunk piece. And I think especially Indians fans by now are probably saying it's got to be Luxor.	1.0
All right, I hate folding clothes and doing laundry and I'll bring a lot of times what happens is will bring the laundry up and the basket just sits there full of clothes like a lot of people dump him on a chair on the bed and then just move them to the floor and it was just then eventually it's like you need to rewash them. They're so rich Wrinkled. So AE Dimock says changing betting after those fucking idiots piss themselves, which is another twist. So if you like wake up and we'll let your kid gets sick or pees himself and you have to like change sheets or like do laundry in the middle the night that sucks.	0.0

No did not get the bends it really depends on how long you've been under and how deep he's gone. And the gas you breathing on it can all change depending on if you're breathing on oxygen or nitrogen or helium. The different depths. You have to stop at the different periods of time. You have to stop at and I remember the first time that I did it will do her in still in training and we were doing Bounce dive, so just basically down and up on a helmet to about 60 meters about a hundred eighty feet through sixes open. Yeah hundred eighty eight and my we always dive with bodies when possible because it's a dangerous business and it's nice to have someone there to back you up, but my body couldn't clear his is and so I had to go down by myself. And this is just outside the heads of Sydney Harbour and this is a great white shark highway is tiger sharks as bullshit. And so I have to sit at my what we call a wet. Stop a decompression stop at about 15 meters for 10 minutes. And I feel like the smallest most indefensible worm on a hook. I've who's so exposed in the middle of the ocean.	0.0
I just want to read something that I pulled off your Instagram which I love Yeah, an intuitive eating tip. Okay, guys. Hey Doodles are stocking for us anything deeper than base level that you provide us. Casey will find I might know why I think I should have been a private investigator in my past life. I shagged stalker. Anyways, actually just reviewing the records like you had have to do an assessment, right? Yeah. I'm just reviewing the records they all right. She says order the salad if that's what you want what you're craving. Being in the moment, but don't consistently order the salad because you think you should or you think that's a good choice. Right? So like you're saying if you feel like it in the moment and you want it do it, but don't do it based on. Oh, I have to have a salad, right that's part of the diet. And that's kind of talking about MO is Casey if you know what I mean in the moment, right like you have certain things that in one moment. What are a mosrite a mozar when we talk about kind of the background information that Either increases or decreases the value of a certain reinforcer a Punisher in that moment. What do I mean? Okay. So let's say like my body is in a state of deprivation of having anything healthy in a while. Like I've just been on a at a tailgate all day eating crap in my body. That's the background information, right? So in that moment, that's the mo right like a salad or some things in establishing operation from my body is wanting that right. So that's what I'm going to have right then. But on another day, sometimes I just crave a freaking hamburger to bite into right like that's what I want at the time obviously a vegan one yell never real me moo, but in that moment what you'd still be allowed? Oh my God yells really changed guys Adam. I used to like cook salmon and privacy like I like I like She's gone. Everyone looked at those to make it a JB come to my house tonight and but one thing talking about like demos and what's valuable in that moment. Like one moment. This could be valuable for the next hour something else can and I think of really prime example and tell me if this would be intuitive to me. It seems that way. Yeah. Oh, but so when I initially didn't know what was going on with my hands and I was in hospital and it was a result of not having any circulation my fingers started freezing off and they were like going from Black to whatever it was people would say like what can I bring to her in the hospital? What can I bring? What can I bring in? The only thing I wanted was watermelon and I like watermelon but like in no way is that something like I typically crave or I want or like I need just watermelon and that was the only thing I wanted at the time and like I literally ate like probably like two watermelons a day like just cut up and and you know a few months post like my amputation surgery someone sent me. Me an article from the Harvard Business review or Harvard Business or I don't know my brain is going blank right now, but it was essentially about like the circulation properties of blood circulation properties of watermelon and how like they actually like sometimes recommended as a replacement for Viagra, which I actually take now as a medication three times a day and no I don't have erections because its original use was for blood circulation. But anyways, like my body was telling We got you want watermelon. You want watermelon now, do I crave it? No, but that's all I wanted at the time and I found that so fascinating.	1.0

I don't think it's kind of like a meme on the internet right now. We're yeah gold armor and helmets appear or it's the giving tree of Apex. Yeah, these Supply boxes just outside of this little metal Archway. So pit has gold armor in it or has a higher chance of it, but I don't know if it's true or not.

Let's see. I don't want to I don't want to miss it. Miss say it because it's so good. Romans 8:28 I'm flipping there now. So if you want you can flip their to or not. Just listen and we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. And so we know definitely that God had a purpose for Abraham Abraham whose Abram at this point answer I write that all that the nation. Be blessed through them and so regardless or despite the fact that Sarai and Abram took things into their own hands because they were impatient on God's promise on God's time. He still made it work for his good for the purpose of of his plan right for his purpose of Abram and Sarai. So sir, Ian Abrams still received the sun.	0.0

Yeah, so and I think you and I are like, I'm the oldest child too and my brothers eight years younger than me. So I was kind of an only child for quite a while to and I also combat it anxiety by doing things and over functioning and that's kind of when I need to get better about realizing this but when I get to the point where I'm like doing all the things and you know, working and working out and planning parties and like doing doing doing doing doing it's like it's only a matter of time before I'm gonna like Crash and Burn and are your are you me?	0.0

And I'm hyped about this. I think going to be a lot of fun.	1.0
No, I agree with you. And so let's go with it. Brian Burns who again is my draft Crush. So I trust you with Brian Burns again long athletic. He was a productive player at Florida State and he all he does is make plays he can really get after the quarterback. And as we as we've seen from tape with the Chiefs and what Mike Smith likes to do with the outside linebackers, he will get that football. He will get a lot of strip sacks and that is built exactly for what the Packers can do. So as we move to pick 30, so kind of recapping what happened. After Brian Burns was taken by Green Bay and 12 Drew lock goes to Miami at 13 Christian Wilkins to the Falcons DK Medcalf to Washington Jonah Williams to the Panthers replace Matt Khalil a Cleveland Pharrell to the Giants Dalton Reisner to the Vikings. That's gonna hurt Ross Cody Ford to the Titans Devin Bush to the Steelers greedy Williams to Seattle. That's a really good fit there Camille Harry your Arizona State boy to Baltimore Garrett Bradbury to Didn't Josh Jacobs to the Raiders Chauncey Gardiner Johnson the safety from Florida to the Eagles Hakeem Butler to the Colts TJ Hawkinson goes to the Raiders at 27 Byron Murphy cornerback from Washington to the LA Chargers and Mack Wilson from Alabama to the Chiefs. There's a normal name that I didn't just read and I think we're going to take him a 13. That's probably no offense.	1.0

No, I no doubt about that. And so we'll go back into the thresholds Park pinned on your Twitter at Tyler underscore dress everyone. Go check that out. He has a Google document with the Packers threshold along with draft prospects and whether they made them whether they visited with the team with their combine measurements were and what they can possibly bring to this team. So take a look at that. So Tyler I'll let you just kind of run with it. What are these thresholds at? The Packers are looking at?	1.0

Probably the worst to me when I last year. So I just think back to that if I'm feeling really bad I think back to that. I think this really is not that bad but things could get much worse and that helps me. Yeah, but I also Tell myself a lot if I'm starting to feel crap, and I just want it to end. I just tell myself for this this time is going to pass. Anyway, there's will spend it doing something Kick-Ass something I can talk about later and that helps me keep going, you know.	0.0
I've been told 45 know this little venture. Yep, and it's actually part to our first part. To it's about the worst parenting chores because part one went long it went along because it is a lot of terrible parenting Choice, which is basically what this entire podcast is about is how much parenting sucks you haven't told everyone that there's going to be a part 3 4 5 high in fact, if you think about it, every episode of this podcast is just another yeah the worst parenting chore and just bedtime.	0.0

You don't want to bring them to your church because they're going to think it's weird or you don't want to you know, You don't want to talk about the things of God with them or the things that you feel called to do because you know some somewhere deep down inside. You know, that they're not on the same page with you. Well, that's the first thing you need to you need to dump them because they are not on the same page with you and especially if you're a woman and you're looking at this guy and you're like, you know truly he's not everything that I ever thought that I could have in a husband but you know, the devil's lied to you to make you think that you this is as good as it's gonna get I want to tell you if you're in a relationship like that. Get out of it quick and just be thankful that you didn't get married already and just be great glad that you still have time. God can restore redeem and he can push you with the right person, but don't be caught in this trap the way you think that since you're in this relationship already that now you have to conform your life to fit into this relationship with this person. That doesn't have a Zeal for God like you have just because you're already in the relationship for whatever reason it's not it's not permanent. And you know, if you are married then you need to now pray for your spouse. You need to now make it your goal that you're going to believe God that this person is going to come around on the same page with you, but I will tell you that's the harder road to take. So if you're not married to that person yet. Don't marry them based on the fact that you think well because they're just so cute that everything's going to work out even though they have no Zeal for God and you know that you can run circles around them spiritually and they're not even interested.	0.0

I think we're in a Content bubble. Because content bubble. Yeah, because people's Leisure Time Has stayed the same if not minimize. Like if not over time has become less and less like people's time to watch entertainment. But the more content that's being produced there less time like people like me have to consume it. So then we have to make choices like there's some good content that I won't watch. So at some point with all these Services coming in we're going to lose like the ability to even in participate or watch like great great shows so that much that's money lost. You know. Yeah that's sort of a and I choose and now for some reason I choose to consume less like easily accessible content over excellent content, you know, like instead of watching like Better Call Saul I'm going to instead opt for like a twitch stream because it's so accessible.	1.0

I'm sure I mean again it goes back to it's all about the core four and then everybody else is just at the whims of whatever the story dictates. I guess we could use Kevin for a scene here. Ok, let's write Kevin and see him but we're not going to do anything else with that character until we need them again. Like it's a little frustrating for moments like this because it's I could go either way with at least the amount of screen time that you've given me on Riverdale of Kevin.

Yeah, the only time I'm trying to think of I feel like we usually say immediately when the Indians make a trade that they got the better end of it. Don't we like I mean, I think the night that Trevor Bauer got traded it was like we found out one named after another and it was because at first it was like think we do we try to remember the order because I was going all around the room trying to get Intel from players is they heard from people or Get you know, you get a text from a front office person at one point or a an Asian and and it's like you slowly pieced this together and each piece. It was like, oh my God, this is like better and better. It's unbelievable. I feel like most of the Indians trades your immediate takeaway is they got the better end. Like I remember like the Eric Gonzalez trade and who knows how that will end up it was said like a three four. Three or three four two. Yeah, and obviously Max Mara was a bust but like Jordan loop low looks like he's going to absolutely destroy left-handed pitching and maybe more and they have them for a long time and are cazalas every time he played on the field last year. He injured one of his teammates. So that looks like it's immediately that seemed like a decent trade because Lupo had a pretty good minor league pedigree. The only one that didn't was was the on Gomes trade and we all look foolish now, Your Roberto Perez had and seeing what Daniel Johnson could do. So I feel like they always seem to win trades immediately. And I mean like obviously long-term. They do Francisco. Mejia hasn't done anything and the Padres have like been in the market for catching. I hope so. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what that sentiment is. Like if they end up trading Lindor who is everybody's favorite player and clearly the best player and on the roster Like fans allow themselves to say man. It sucks losing Lindor, but holy shit.	1.0
Well maybe not all of the shows were good when we were kids because my mom even says that to me and I say like old Disney was better and she's like, okay.

Yeah, that's the way to go. That's the way to do it. But yeah, that's not the situation that we have today in the peripheral countries of the Eurozone the situation that we have there is that people are being used to being subsidized out of play. Chuckles yeah, the political leadership of those countries. They I mean in Asia 1997 your Thailand Indonesia. So on the leadership of those countries are no places elsewhere to go. They were stuck with their God their own country. Yeah. Okay, so they were dependent on getting the country back on the rails, but now the political Elites in Portugal and Spain Greece anywhere. Have you brought this lava and Slovakia Romania and so on I mean there Korea's a lot within their own countries and within the operators of the European Union, so they want to go to vassals. They want to have jobs that are created by the European Union lavishly funded so paid under with the same Revenue relation has similar jobs in Germany and so on but then in their own countries, so that's what they want. Their loyalty are not their own country. They are increasingly to this international organization.	0.0

I know the name for that. Mops is what it was called and only This is an organ think white organs. It's like an early start school or something like that. So you can like basically pretty good. Yeah, it's a priest praying for you guys know I'm supposed to be a freshman. Yeah, I think you said yeah people ask me like all your parents wanted you to be smart was like now that that was fucking 90 Min 3 Min kindergarten and they don't deny it. They're like fuck. Yeah, that kid was fucking annoying when he was growing up. They had me one time.

You killed him.	0.0
All right, I think one of the biggest things that you so much stuff that I took from that was the fact that it's not all about just like certain people certain lifestyle. Yeah, definitely because I know some of our like summer guys were like, why are we where are we learning a essentially help with drug addict?	1.0

So there's the typical what people see in the media right that people living on the street that are using hardcore drugs. That's what is all of the TV. So that's what people think that that's where the crisis is, but it's anywhere from The Accidental overdoses from people or first-time users sharing a pill Young. Is trying to get high first first time sharing a fake Dilaudid or something and they accidentally overdose versus just a an elderly patient who may have certain morphine or Dilaudid on board as well other pain medications if they accidentally take too much that still isn't stolen overdose. And if you have a kid, you could still use that to help them come out of it. You have there's there's so many facets to to being able to respond to an emergency and there's could be totally though just those accidental overdoses fentanyl now is in everything. Some people are putting it in in cigarettes and selling them as Cocoa Puffs. So they think it's cocaine mixed in with the tobacco. However, it's actually fentanyl it's fennel. So cheap, right? So they gets caught with everything we're seeing in our area now with one of the the team's I On we're seeing friend all in everything. We're seeing in crystal meth we're seeing in cocaine. We're seeing it in marijuana. So people are just lazy it with it. So you never know what you're getting. So people always argue with us say, oh, it's I get it from my normal guy fickle that street pharmacist. Sorry. It's not gonna be it's not gonna be as as good or as pure as you said, you never know the consistency of it. So when you Consistency. I always go back to one story of you know, two people they want to split a pill they break it in half. The one person takes it he over also the other person takes the other half. He's not going to overdose and the reason is because it's there's no consistency that you can't you can't mix it super well, like I always describe taking a handful of salt throwing it on table take a pinch of salt and so the color Sprinkle it over that and you're going to see a random assortment of different colors specs in nicer cutting that up into piles that one pile might have two specs three specs for aspects that other pile might only had one Speck and depending on where that spec gets put on your side of the pill or whatever wherever you're smoking or injecting. You don't know the consistency of it. So that's why some people overdose harder and go down while harder than others when you you took a picture of	0.0

The worst thing was the day like the day after the Friday when we were flying back. Back, it was still the same weather in Porto.

So you get out the flipping trivial I transfer you sweating will you like panicking when they pitch inspection that was happening?	0.0
Yeah and then the two corridors leading out of artillery. Well that's like a decent amount of loot as well.	1.0
Yeah and look so we kind of dismayed that decision to go down that path but we definitely had kind of a backup option there. But as I said, but yeah speaking to people from even Newcastle similar sort of thing there be closer to Sydney. So maybe they have some options there but hiring it's just almost taken for granted maybe or at least I took it for granted a little bit, but I guess as a follow-on Are there any other particular difficulties that you kind of face or that maybe we don't we're not aware of being in a couple of city that you faced in Regional areas.	1.0
Yes.	1.0
Week has been Che well, okay the answer to their question I think is obvious. It's definitely up to you. Whether it's better you look around at your older siblings and your parents and most of you will see that it does get better. Okay, Julia look at them. Yeah. I know. I think I yep. I think the hardest stage to be but definitely the most exciting is your twenties. If you have a good education which both of you do and a good head on your shoulders. Most of the time you will be 20. Yeah the important part of being young and learn From your mistakes. Yeah, listen, because it listen to this sentence. This is very important good judgment comes from experience. And experience well that camp comes from bad judgment. Yes. Say it louder for the people in the back. There's no people in the back row in my bedroom that comes from bad judgment. So every time something happens, that's not good you get to learn from And need to be honest with yourself. Don't blame others for your mistakes. Come clean. Even if it's only with yourself make the changes necessary to succeed and don't be afraid to change direction if you're unhappy.	1.0
Well now we've I wrote on their first album, actually I wrote um, she gives me writing credit, but I helped her write a couple joints on the first time, but you know, it's waiting on huh You know how she went headfirst into mommyhood. So we'll see but she's an incredible songwriter.	1.0
What is next for you?	1.0
She is such a soul and I know that like every single person is going to look at this interview and be like another mom saying it's going to get better and everything's going to work out. She's different. She's different like she has been through and the advice of like don't take advice from people that don't that was the best. That was the best thing I've heard because there are so many people in my oh, I'm sure oh my God, there's a lot of people that have input on your life. But but you don't really really like them and really have no idea what you're going through. In your personal life. Yeah, so if they don't know if this is a good quote if they don't know you personally don't take it personal. There. It is. Alright bang. So this is like kind of funny because we just had a like deep discussion and now we're going to talk about sex. So we're all over the place. Yeah. I mean honestly, we just this is a shit storm, but we're doing our best but we these questions are actually kind of amazing and there's also a story that we can share. Yes, that's us Also, it's also just horrifying. All right. So, um, we're not announcing and everybody's in everyone's Anonymous a lot of girlfriends contributed So, yeah, thank you to our girlfriends. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks ladies. So the first question is do colleges actually have sex parties or is that just in the movies? No, at least. I'm not any I know about and I am I probably would not ever want to go to that because that's a little scary. Yeah. No, I mean I've never really heard of that. I've never had the invite. Oh God. Yeah. No, I haven't had an invite. I have heard and sort of maybe seen some weird things but I've never like I think the closest thing to a sex party has been like seeing people in a club like just all touching each other and really having yeah, like literally having sex like, oh my God this greatly. Yeah, so like, okay like that's all but that's not even a sex party. That's all I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really know a little bit more private about my sex life. So saying this is like weird for us to talk about. Yeah, I well I thought it would be we thought it would be funny. So yeah, I think it's hopefully just in movies or if like if you're in a public school Define sex party orgies. Yeah, like I don't really like her but cut in my nose. Yeah. I mean maybe some people do I think if you go I'll ever Arizona or I think it was those big crazy schools. Like we went to Suffolk. I was still in school in Boston. Yeah. I went to school in Vermont and we did not have that experience. No, I think I think that's just in the movies girl. I think that's a little let's all pray together that it's just in the mood. Let's pray. The next question comes from one of my girlfriends and I think that it's just like such an amazing thing so should body count be a topic of discussion in relationship. Oh, I think if somebody asks your body count, they should be prepared to probably not be the happiest because if they're asking their Curious and they're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I mean Yeah, or they just want to know so that they have it against you without saying they want to hold it in you know, but I'm also the type of person I'd ask because I don't care I've asked every not that I've dated a bunch of guys because I haven't but everyone I've pretty much been with. Oh I was asked to I've said how like what's your number because I like especially people I've dated because what am I saying? I've had like one serious boyfriend but with Cody I've asked him and I it's nothing I would ever hold against somebody no. I'm not at all unless if your number is outrageous then that's a little questionable but it's definitely something that just is like I'm just curious like it's not that I'm an insecure person. It's just that I just want to know want to hear how naive I am. This is how it this is how bad well this was also a few years ago. I was still in college my old roommate Grace her and I were like in my bedroom and we were talking one day and she goes what's your number and I literally was like nine seven eight eight five three, and I don't know that's not even mine or telephone number. Yeah, and I started saying My telephone number and she was like no. No, she was like you idiot like your body count and I was like, oh I was like, I don't know. I've never thought of it. I don't know why I don't think of it all that much and I think that's probably just because it's not something that's like a game-changer in any of my relationships because I've never really been with someone who's like slept with hundreds of people saying yeah, but that's that and if someone but I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be interested. I would not be interested. Yeah like I'd be like, okay. Well, obviously If it's if it's over, I'm not going to say like what my number is or like what not my number but what like my ideal number and a partner is but if it's over a certain amount then gotta go because like that's sorry. Yeah. I'm like flexible about stuff like that. Like I know that a lot of people our age like sleep around and experiment and do not like different things. Yeah. So that's never bothered me. We have one question or not. Really a question. It's actually a story from one of our girlfriends. And shoot I was looking through. Okay. Here's Tiffany's. Well, that's not even her real name. So I guess it's fine. Oh God is a lot of Tiffany's there's a lot of Tiffany's in this world. Okay, so shout out to this bitch.	1.0
You know, what's interesting is like I didn't feel I felt sad for him because so let me take you through the so so that happened at 12:00 right when I'm 21 reconnected with my father and that's when I came into my sister's life. Then that dissipated now. I mean I've been in my sister's life ever since then but I'm saying him and I was relationship. I'm 25. I try to do it again doesn't work. Then when I was about to turn 30 at a long conversation with one of my aunts that inspired me to try to rekindle that didn't work and so through my life up to you know, when he passed away. I had tried to open this door, but through that experience. I learned that you know Every relationship has to be a dialogue and can't be a monologue. And for some reason when certain, you know, we would talk about certain things and when certain things would come about he would certain Poise a conversation will come about he would just close off he would just close off and so, you know, I told them, you know, I told them I forgave him. I told him, you know, it's all love and you know, I gave him those things and you know, I would tell him I'm saying, you know, they must be if we're both still here God must have a purpose for us to build something, you know, so so when he passed, you know, and I'm saying this just to be honest with you and I'd say this with no I'm not trying to be it was like hearing that someone passed, you know outside like when I leave here, you know, it was like a stranger because I didn't know and For me, I just felt more sad for him because it didn't have to be that way, you know, and he had other kids. He had one other son who he was in and out of his life. So but I was the first one I was the oldest and there was a point that like I did so let me tell you this other part like with my sister. I I got to a point where I was like I was willing to have been the guinea pig like I get it I was your first kid is all new to you volleyball. But when I saw that he repeated that pattern with my sister, that's when I lost a bit of respect. I come on like I would have much rather. That's when I had expectation. I thought at that point he would have been like yeah, I figured it out. Okay, you know also given but when he repeated that same pattern with her That's you know, that was a disappointment.	0.0

I've managed to beat my body into submission, but it does what it's told but I've been I might not have been running Ultras went. 13 years or whatever, but I've been still running for a long time and I think that counts for something and I do strength training as well. Which for me everyone's different. So a lot of others don't do it and they seem to get by fine, but strength training really works for me and it helps me with my endurance. Maybe I am a bit Lucky in a way that I can recover quickly, but I tend to think not I don't think it's love. I think it's just persistence and just at the cumulative effect of Many years ago breathing. Yeah, I'm lucky. I don't really get major injuries. I had had hip adductor tendonitis in the past.

There's this agency which goes by the name of Monarch in a specializes in the hunt for massive unidentified terrestrial organisms. And today it is a today's episode is on just one of them the skull crawler. The information I got is from the King Kong Wiki and from the Monarch files. Here we go. Little is known about the origins of this voracious Predator. Although its evolutionary purpose is it is abundantly clear the skull crawler exists to devour destroy and dominate Subterranean a nature and burrowing up through through the geologically unstable. Steve leant across Skull Island. It is as though the skull crawler climbed up out of hell itself, and this terrifying Serpentine animal is a hyper for a creature with such a hyper a generalized metabolism that it exists in And of course instead of starvation and just as a shark must keep swimming to survive the the skull crawler must keep feeding dislocate dislocating its own jawbone's so to maximize its ability to swallow anything that crosses its path and within that gaping cavernous small exists along Whiplash tongue in which the creature uses to ensnare and constrict its prey.	1.0

Well, I mean but with hard work, it's been taught before the 19th century Rhino new government that meant so meddling with with education really started only the 19th century before you had. I thought private Association that the church is in particular would take care of this. So it was not needed that anybody tax tax funded education either either Elementary education middle schools high schools throughout the university and so on it was just being handled anyway, and it's true. So this case great great latitude like greater responsibilities to parents who I'd known all parents will beat their children to high school or addicted to the you to the university and so on. Yeah, I think that that would probably the better situation than we have at present in any case people would have much sound ideas as far as all social political questions are concerned because they would not be systematically biased the system that we have right now. I know exactly how it is in the UK, but I see this year in France. And in Germany is the educational level diminishes every year and we've observed with for the past 40 or 50 years. I mean read the level of Education actually diminishes. So they're doing a very lousy job as far as the quality of education is concerned and if you listen to the education bureaucracy in France, the main concern is not really the level of academic achievement. It's equality. So they want to have student populace that is equal. So we want to prevent it some people get ahead of others and get a head start when it comes to the professional life. And so also they want Everybody to be on the same on the other on the start line at the age of 18 or 19 or whenever they leaving school. That's their main objective is not to teach anybody to help people. They just want to make them equal.	0.0

Student that allows for the at-will libitum creation of money and here comes canes and he's not the only one who's one of them and explains them why this is a good thing. So therefore I think they'd hire people of this sword there are constructive. So say if you've got this kind of comments off my back when you apply through you make up a research by for research and and so on and say, okay, so where is this? He's leading us right what kind of policy can we justify with this or help help ameliorate and so on if you say well I probably this doesn't justify anything it if it goes anywhere it probably rather leads to criticizing the whole point of intervening in the first place. Well, then they're no longer interested in finding it because you're not being constructed.	0.0

Yeah, because God and Faith day. He invented the Ikea high chair.	1.0

Books, but to the right there was a formal dining room that you could see from the front door.	1.0
Yes, that's cool. When we were younger. We were super close and now that we're older we're super close. Yeah even Closer Closer now. Yeah, he's one of my brother's groomsmen by the way. Yeah.	1.0
Well, I mean the difficulty I don't see the difficulty there. That's not come from the fact that the others would be performing better by the Blazing their own currencies, but what they do is just to redistribute existing resources. Thibault, the politically well connected to the detriment of the others the problem I think for for this is ordinarily right for a country that has a sound o better money that other countries right now we've been doing for 10 years now, we've made great efforts to make sure that Swiss franc the British pound Euro and the American dollar becoming more is the same thing as really very few changes. No many just options that we exchange rates and so on but let's say if you have known and foreseeable differences the quality of money to different country. So one country is more inflationary the other is that this stationary What happens is that promotes? Exports on those countries that have a worse money because the residents of those countries. Well, they want to reduce Autumn minimize their Holdings of their own inflationary money as much as possible, right so they want to get hold of a better money. This is what you see in all countries that are so dollar rise rise the phenomena of polarization. All of these countries have export surpluses and the strings from the fact that they need to pay for the dollars that they really want to own. They don't want to all their own. Local pocket money they want to own as our bodies such as the last so long since nobody's giving the colors they need to buy them. So they export so they have a structural export Surplus and therefore countries with the better money than structural import circles. All right. So the the industry is those countries are suffering under foreign competition precisely because foreigners want to get some of the local Honey, that's the reason why the US for example as structural import deficit because many more even though the dollar might be quite lousy as a money, especially as compared to Gold. It's still better than most of the other monies that are around in the world. So people want to buy buy dollars and there are therefore they need to export services to get those those dollars from the US and therefore soup President Trump's policies that try to reverse this trend just with Exponent important controls with tariffs and so on will not succeed. Simply for this reason you see so the difficulty of such a country is not that the police use of work would not workers not before the country. It's that it creates pressure on the local producers. And so you get political resistance from that definitely that's that's brilliant.	1.0
Well, that's that's good news to hear and it's great news to hear that everybody physically is okay and it's just a horrible horrible thing. Take care of the planet people. So why we're saying take care of the planet only when I give describe your military career basically for us it seems to me that you basically	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. And that basically has a link to my speaking that I do. So now I'm out here. I'm traveling around America. I'm off to Kansas City Missouri for my first trip next Wednesday to go and speak at a big conference. I've done Amazon Snapchat. Viacom Microsoft like all the big companies and I just love it. I really really enjoyed getting out speaking to these companies and these businesses and people and just sharing all of the things I've learned about life and all of these cool stories and just lighting a fire up that everyone's asses so that they start to live again because people go through shit, you know what it's like you don't know what the person next to you is going through. We all have these Amazing Stories and struggles and sometimes we just need that. That fire lit up under ass again. And so that's what I love to do aside from chocolate.	1.0
Yeah. So well produced. We're so off schedule Waters. Can you tell the world and all the fans? Why are we so late? Why don't we were supposed to do this? Weekly? Okay. I'm putting you on blast before the podcast.	1.0
I think how you've kind of raised it to it. It works really well because the whole game tries to force you to play like a team and effective and to work together to be able to start up this Titan or unlock it or you know that kind of thing and knowing that it's at one specific location. So it's not going to be like it's going to be obviously a hot Drop. I think teams will like multiple teams will aim for it. So you'll have like that hot battle outside of that Titan, so it'll be interesting and and I'd have never played.	1.0
That's that's rough math. Like they say there's all the time and the music industry. Designed to keep you in debt and this is just another example of it man. It's a lot of these little backwards deals that they that they toss in there to keep you to keep you working to keep they pockets lace while you get next to nothing out of it. It's just it's sad bro. Like I don't ever want to see nobody go through that. Especially someone that works like, you know, the way we know all know Kanye works okay ago in the hibernation and work for like 6 to 7 months straight. No and very seldom calling out for For some time. So I just think that's it's just toughness like never Rockefeller of all, you know of all places like kind of crazy. It just makes you think different about a lot of people that we'd be celebrating even the labels that we'd like yo, they was getting it. It's like yeah, but at what cost a lot of people like basically selling a soul just to get on and years later 15 years later. They still can't they can't even break free of that shit. Like I was just explained with the de la Sol's Shit that they came out with 30 years ago today, you know saying they can't even say not even getting money off of that which is crazy. Like how do you still have a choke?	0.0

I think you've got to the heart of my own skepticism with relation to Keynesian economics.

Yeah. And so you bought your by this game and then you'll play the BR and then you'll realize like, oh, it's not a smooth running. Let's say its apex like right off the get-go, right?

Um, I remember it was back during the first season when it was episode 9 the scene where Styles pushes Derek are Derek bushes. Stiles up against the door, and I thought that they were going to kiss but they didn't so then I kind of just dropped the whole thing didn't really think anything of it and then in like 2012. I got Tumblr and I saw like a piece of fan art for Styles and Derek and I was like, oh there are other people who thought the same thing that I thought so then I checked the stair tag, and this was back when like there was like three pieces of like fan art and like a few little pose. And then I found out about shipping and fandom and like before that. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what shipping was and like steric was like my first Fick and then I just kind of just stayed in the fandom as if that's the show went on in the guns like season 2 when Jeff was like talking about steric more on Twitter back when he had a Twitter. He wasn't scared to talk to us.	1.0
They could win and it's like this isn't even ours long know the best one was someone tried to post a steric versus D'Elia versus stadia because the studio thought that the sterics were going to be split and then it would just be steady all the way but I'm like no you instantly are going to be split. So just like as soon as we started dominating someone hit that delete button. This is like, oh what happened what happened to the pole?	0.0
That's right. Check her out.	1.0
You know what I'm just glad you need to bring the energy out. But I'm glad I got a little bit out of here.	1.0
I think we've already put more time into this in pre-production than we had and paper cutter by far by far well, and I think that's one of the lessons we learned from paper cutter is the best time you can spend is in pre-production that planning doesn't cost very much.	1.0
That's probably a normal decision, I guess because there's part of me that says like our the last time we had when somebody died so we shouldn't do that again, but then there's also the part of me too. It's like you got to get back on the horse, right?	1.0
As far as cooking goes do you want to talk about cooking for one first? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what's your I'm going to talk about cooking tips for people on their own what to buy and how the faith? Yeah. Yeah, we're not going to go alone. I like everyone else. I had a budget. I knew my total monthly net salary and I knew my expenses whatever I had left was for food entertainment in the inevitable birthday present. Yes. Yeah. I had my money in a credit union where every month they took out a certain amount and it was deposited into what I refer to as my rainy-day fund. Okay, when my yeah, it was a great thing on my car insurance bill came in once a year. It came out of the rainy day fund if I got a medical bill it came out of the rainy day fund saving it's important. Easy, but if you have a little stash of funds when something out of the ordinary occurs get a flat tire or something happens to your car, you know, whatever any little thing you have the money to cover it and it doesn't ruin your monthly budget. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great thing to have for Christmas presents to shopping. Say that again. Where did you go food shopping. I used to go to either the Stop and Shop or Star Market. Okay, the term Market isn't when I was I was living in Roslindale. Okay. Yeah, what's a good? Say that again. What's a good one a good cheat meal other than Ramen like a good meal. You know what when I was growing up I was growing up when I was living by myself, and I didn't want to cook but I happen to love. I love baked potatoes. Love them. That's what I go when I would do believe it or not. Open up the baked potato throw the mushrooms and peppers on top with a little bit of cheddar cheese. And it was delicious. I also used to do that. I would put a put it in a pita pocket with some cheese on it. I also own. Oh my God, hold on. We're calling her. Hold on technical difficulties.	1.0

I'm so excited for that one. It's uh, it's going to be so much fun. Can I tell him one of the locations for the movie? Yeah. We see that we scouted. Yeah, I do it we're shooting in a old video store. Yeah, and not only does it look like an old video store. It smells like an idiot.	1.0

Then you've got a laundry Pile in your bedroom.	1.0
Yeah, well as much alluded to earlier on with giving the goals away too easily. We're not killing games off and that's why we against against Braga and the next game should have been out of sight really but I was actually here when that game was going on and then drove back listen to on the radio and I just said it just makes the come back for the form of even more amazing when they inevitably come back in two days. You didn't know that there was one that was going to give it away at some point we Play well for 90. It was very similar to The Villa guy absolutely battered of their staff from one of our best performances with Villa and then they get a man set off as well. So I'm thinking what is going to absolutely annihilate him second half but they seem to up their game with yeah - we just I don't know what happened. But that goal from a teeny. Oh, you think it was across that? Yeah, I think mentees you think I think he meant. Well you did it again today. Maybe it's going to become his thing is that he can score from these ridiculous tight angles, but he just sits right?	0.0

No, dude it was Cool, because you know why I was back the next day on contract worth making more making more. So this this is where it gets fun because okay third and I'm done with the layoff stories.

It has given me everything. I know like I'm just so thankful. I stayed in it for so long because he gave me the technique it showed me how to connect my body properly because everything is done from your Center in Ballroom. All the strength comes from your legs and your Center and hopefully it resonates through your face and through your upper body, you know, so it gave me definitely that strength and connections inside my body. So when I do something that's outside Ballroom, I still feel like I'm able to be connected and look kind of okay fish but it definitely gave me discipline. So on it's good to plan and my body and going through pain, you know and and discomfort and sometimes when you feel like wow, I feel so good today and you look at the video like what is that bad and then like some competitions I walk off the floor and I'm like how like that was. The worst dancing I've ever done in my life and we watched the video with her coach and she's like this is probably one of your best competitions ever, huh? So it always taught me like don't trust your like the interview boy.	1.0

It's been a couple of goals like that that have just shown everything that's good about our attacking play within two or three seconds. And then we score a goal everything from that goal was perfect and showed bettina's class and think a quick-thinking tray. All right is showing that he's on the same page everybody else now and making that run and human has his His and product from compared to last year particularly good like I'm real and and if you notice all writing about 85% of the time we attacked on the right now because I think of some Jolly Joe or on the other white did that much today really was always going down the right way to take some imagery.	1.0
So I gotta say this news about James really took me aback. It felt like there had to be more to the story. So I've been calling emailing texting whatever I can do to get ahold of James and so far nothing. He hasn't even liked one of my tweets, but in all seriousness, I'm not as much bothered that he isn't responding to me. What bothers me is that he's blowing off Sterling it's fine if he changed his mind about investing these things happen, but it feels like At least pick up the phone and tell Sterling that the good news is James wasn't the only one who invested in sandbox Commerce. Okay. Well so Jillian also invested on the show what happened with that? I mean she didn't ghost on you two. Did she know? All right, so she mentioned she would introduce you to her partner Jacob did that end up happening?	0.0

I started off as an engineer. So I studied mechanical engineering took some economics classes some some management classes. The idea was to train for Korea and industrial management, but then I fell in love with economics and kind of Economics that I've the first attracted me was mainstream economics.

These couples was they talked about having clear boundaries. And so for all of you out there listening. I'm going to give a little bit of homework here, but you should even if you're if you're in a relationship if you're not in a relationship, especially if you're not yet in a relationship, but you should write down clear boundaries and you should have them prepped out before we're on where if you start dating someone that you can have a sit down and say listen, this is the boundaries that I'm committed to when I spoke to this first couple they said men and the The wife said it was so good for me. I have such trust in him because he sat down he had his boundaries. She had her boundaries. They kind of came to a consensus and they said will never cross there someone if we feel like it's getting to be too much someone's going to yell and they and I asked him I said, what would you do differently? Is there anything you would change and they said honestly we didn't and that's really the fruit. You don't want to leave it until you're in a compromised situation to exercise self-control. That's when it's too far. The Bible says to make no. Vision for the flesh. If you find yourself in a position where things are being compromised. You've actually made an allowance in your boundaries. Your boundaries should be that you're not in a compromised position and not only that but like Krista said to avoid the appearance of evil you doing that. I mean there's there's coffee drinks that I can't take pictures of and post on my Instagram story because like Nitro coffee, it looks like beer right and so I drink Nitro coffee but almost drink it in secret because it's like I can't it's coffee. I don't have any taste for alcohol. Never touch alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. It's not even if it's in and if it's in my food if I read it on a on a restaurant menu, I don't order that thing because there's alcohol in it, right? That's how that's how strict I am with myself on that. But but I won't take pictures of it because people all of a sudden think what even if it's one out of 200 who doesn't know that I'm in the craft coffee and love good coffee and thinks I've got I'm drinking alcohol. I just won't let it happen. So avoiding. Yeah if it causes one.	0.0

I was like, I was like, okay like I could join the military, they'll pay for my college and also like it was kind of like not sure if I was ready for college to be completely honest, like I felt like I needed to kind of go out and like see the world and like screw around a little bit. And you know not it's not a very not very popular. I did like not go to college right after high school, but it is if you join the military, I think it's just weird and I definitely would recommend it for anybody and I definitely would recommend a right now, but but it was it was very good for me. You know, I did I joined the Air Force at 17 and I ended up spending about five years in the military honestly because I knew at the other end of that I'd be able to afford to go to film school. Yeah. Well, thank you for your service. No. Thank you for your service. All right, so did it pay? A off do you after you so you yeah, so in the military then now you're going back to films.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Yeah. Well and I think that I usually think comments are they make me laugh and I actually really enjoy talking to haters like yeah, you know the sweet-looking, you know young person just wrote something like well you're sending everyone to hell and you're going to hell yourself. And yeah, I just like called her out. and was like hey, why do you believe that like, do you know that I'm a person and you're saying that to me on the internet and that's like actually such a terrible thing to say to somebody and a lot of them apologize because it's not about me convincing them that my way of thinking is right, but it's more about the more defensive you are and lieu of actually being an empath and listening and like allowing people to On their own Journeys with patience and love instead of always trying to like get everyone onto your team. The more effective you are just as a human being in general, but especially as a Christian, I don't understand what church is telling people that's emboldening them to go online screaming about someone else going to hell like that's yeah. Jesus was not walking around Jerusalem screaming about hell. Yeah, so I'm like, where where did you guys even get that from and what?

Well, I actually consider myself an agnostic atheist. So basically agnosticism is, you know a claim about knowledge. Like I don't know if there's a God or not, but I'm an atheist because I don't currently believe in one. I don't I don't think that I don't know like I don't think there's a God I don't Necessarily see a lot of proof of a God, but I'm more open to that conversation of maybe because I know like when people start talking about science and I start talking about like the origins of the universe and all this stuff. Like that's very fascinating to me and it's not something that I have studied as much as I would like to um, but I never want to be like one of those people where I'm like, yeah, there's absolutely definitely not a God and I'll fight you like to Able to prove that it's like no like I don't have this like hidden agenda. Like I don't want there to not be a God on top of that my friend circle like since their identity was in Christ my identity to them became non-Christian like that is all I was to them or that's how it felt and I would be like introduced as like, oh, this is Nicole. She's a non-Christian. Like this is my reward. Yeah, like to their new like church friends and you know more extended people it was like this is my non-Christian friend like that will know that was my label and it was so like demeaning and I'm like literally that's all I am. That's all they see is the lack of belief in their God and then I've had some people stay like you're never going to know true Joy or true happiness or true fulfillment. You're never Have purpose and your life is like destined to be meaningless because you don't believe in our God and that's just like so mean to say and it like really breaks people down and I think that goes back to this idea of like if you break people down enough, they might come back to the belief system and it's like such a manipulative way of going about things for them.	1.0

I was just trying to look I try to remember when Max Scherzer signed his deal because in my mind, I was thinking it with with the Tigers. He didn't truly become really special until late into into his Tigers career who's kind of League average me a little bit better picture up until but very durable very durable true and that was part of Of his Allure, especially when he really took off in 2013. That was his first 200 Innings season. He puts it together another one with the Tigers in 2014. So he had put together back-to-back season was where he looked like a front of the rotation guy at 200 Innings, but he had done that at the age of 29. So he and his free agency entering his age 30 season. That's a lot different than another 2 years beyond that I'm saying for Clevenger. Maybe maybe he builds himself up to to that. sort of level consistent But as you said you would be risking it more as a team at the age of 32 and there are already people that were a little bit nervous I guess is the best way I can put it about the deal that Scherzer sign with the Nationals. And again, he did that entering his age 30 season. So that's a little bit of a different situation but that was a little bit surprising that to me sounded like the Indians rolling through all these names in the Dodger said, oh well, if you're going to roll through all these guys that you like we also would like to make a Of it at Clevenger and then the Indians being the Indians a team that is just there not going to hang up or in this case walk out the door. Just based on you bringing up a name. They'll say okay. Let's talk Clevenger. This is what are realistic thought is on him and they would discuss him and even by the Indians entertaining it just to say we would expect you to give up this completely unobtainable amount of talent in return for Clevenger. You've now quote unquote discussed it. No, I'm not we're not we're not sitting in there. I don't know how as you said I don't know how aggressive these talks actually work. But to me discussing it means that the Indians entertain almost anything and if the fact is that they spent four or five minutes talking about it. They have already discussed it and then at that point leaking that sort of report is factual you did discuss adding my Clevenger to it, but it was completely and totally off the table in terms of reality.

Could you just back? I mean obviously when we couldn't go to a situation where we're holding gold coins and paying for things with gold and silver the physical mental again.

We filmed each other skating we film snowboarding, but it was cool because I manage the terrain park at this local Hill. I don't call it of ski resort. It was a hill, but we had a kick-ass Park man. It was really cool like we there was huge jumps for how small this place was. We built we would go in and Weld and paint the rails in the summer.

This is a very good order we like it. So let's start with number ten. Number ten is Bunker bunker is is very much.

Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank. I'll be honest. I don't even know so first time because he always used to be	1.0

So the trail is very narrow and I'm in terms of like you've got those are grass trees. They used to call them black boys or not. Yes. Yeah, they're everywhere. And so you've got to hold your arms. Out in front of you very Rocky Trail and yet James changing direction constantly and then it's and then lots of ups and downs like so your one minute you'll be okay. So you can never get a consistent gate not even close and if you look on my almost rather, I went from running five and a half minute Kay's to nine-minute gaze to 11 minutes rise. And and so I was really it was hard to and I That was the point where I was like, okay, I need to put it is a slow down here for it. Yeah, you're pushing a little bit too hard too early. There's a couple of real steep lung busting climbs there. They're only so you're going up like 40% gradient, but it's only for probably 20 or 30 meters but there's lots of little climbs like that. So and then it's all those hands and knees kind of stuff, you know, like and then and and it's very easy to get lost in that section and I know for a fact A fact that a lot of people did get lost taking because this is Trails going off in every conceivable Direction into the scrub and it's beautiful, but I don't know it can it's a little bit too moralizing and that section goes on for maybe 4 or 5 kilometers. I get so does seem to go on then you're going through paddocks and then you go on to more Road and then so about kilometer 30 you hit the road or 31 and then it's about On ches to the next aid station, so to a checkpoint two and that's where my first drop bag was. So I got there feeling not fantastic but not terrible. Like I was all right, and I remember coming through there in about three and a half hours, which was I was happy with the time that I was there even though I just so I slow it up a little bit but I was still passing other because it was a group of people that started at six o'clock. So the slower waves started at 6 a.m. M and the faster wave started at 7:00 a.m. So at that point I caught a few of the six o'clock wave people wouldn't always say hello on the way through I saw at all that shout out to Dion who is one of the ladies I used to coach who completed High School 105 last year and she is an absolute Legend and I coach to through that last year and she gave me a big hug at checkpoint 2, which is really just You know that kind of just really lifted my spirits. So yeah, so checkpoint to grab my bag. I drop bag and stuffed in lots of food because the next section from checkpoint 2 to 3 is what I call the death zone. So it's basically it's the hardest section for multiple reasons. It's 22 kilometers between Aid stations. It's got more really technical climbing. And it's the most exposed section of the course as well. So we went through that and I thought okay if I can get through this next 22 kilometers in about 3 hours. I'll be happy. So so now going through going into what is called a just after the Aid Station you go into you'll T Conservation Park, which I always say it's like deja vu it feels the trails feel exactly like the previous. I should Park really Rocky and twisty and up and down and just like impossible to get a rhythm going and that goes for about a kilometer 30 37 or 38. Maybe maybe 36 2 plus 1 3 or 4 kilometers. I pulled out some pretty slow kilometers through that but I'd used I was feeling a bit negative in that point and I thought this is where I need to just back. Back off a little take the pressure off myself and just to get acknowledged that it's going to be slow. No matter what I do. And so I slowed down eight and I thought when I get out on the runnable sections, I'm going to run and and that's what I did. And by the time you get out to about a kilometer 40 you are certain you can sort of run a bit more you're running through these paddocks though with a grass is so long. Like I'm talking up around my past my waist. You're going through these Farms. Yeah. And it's it really likes get really itchy. You can't say yeah, you can't see the ground and sea running and you don't know whether you stepping in a hole or anything because it's where the cows have been. It's really uneven. So that's technical in a different way, you know like and so I but I managed to get through there without twisting my ankle too badly and I got to about kilometer 45 and I'm coming up on this road and I saw lots of cars coming around this country road and then I remembered that the race has changed this year and they now have a 60 kilometer and 37 and I was coming up on the very start of the 60 kilometer race literally as they were about to start and so perfect. I came in at the back and I was about 50 meters from the start line and heard the three two one and then they all started running and so for the next few case, I had people to run with which is fantastic, you know. It will lift and I think made the rice so much better having a having it finished that way and you run across the hindmarsh tears, which is sort of you this exposed and the road it's kind of endless paddocks and I'd say this is yeah. Like I said, it's the Death Zone on the hot days. It's really hard to get through this section. And then I was starting to I was feeling all right, and then I thought I'll smash some gel. Elle's and I've been I've been drinking my infinite fairly like a being a good boy making sure you're staying on top of my nutrition and my hydration and I had and then about you get to about kilometer 53 and you're at the top of this road called. Would Cone Road and it's it's a four kilometer downhill on on bitumen and dirt road all the way down to the aid station. So it's a real relief you get there and it's not too steep that it hurts but steeper. After you can get a nice roll on and I think what did I do? I was managed to get onto a decent pace through their back so might sort of my goal was every time I was on a runnable section was to try and get into the low six minutes per kilometer. And and on this on that section. I got down under six minutes days and just felt sad to feel good again came into the a station feeling great thinking. I've only got a marathon to go now and it got there. In six out and six and a half hours.	1.0

Okay, so we need to talk about that. This is what I'm so funny because I had completely forgot that happen. But that is actually how I think I got to know you and so I really do think that that was the turning point because that's when people are like Lenin he doesn't even like the show he just loves staring. Why would they invite him on and I remember cuz the very first guest Was Not Another Teen Wolf podcast test and then they had the Argent crew then I forget who was on after that. It was an artist was it not dot but Kendra. Okay. I can't remember her artist named Klaus some Kendrick laws something like that. It's like oh, yeah, right and it was all leaning very much one way. And so when there was kind of, you know thoughts of like, oh, let's have someone who's going Hysteric on like who are they going to choose? Who are they going to choose? I don't know that people were talking about it. But I think at that point that's when you kind of start with like, you know, I was kind of told XYZ and that's kind of where that all sparked it, but that's hilarious. I completely forgot about that.	1.0
So even in the winter, I will go down to just like a cami which is if I don't know people in other countries listening I've realized that there are some new stats available to me. So I realized that only 79 percent of you are in the United States. So some of the terminology with our English could be a little bit different when I just throw out these random terms like I'm wearing a cami but it's a tank top a little spaghetti straps and it's something that I use. As an undershirt when I was out grocery shopping earlier. I had a t-shirt over it like if I'm wearing kind of a low-cut top. I like to wear a cami under it to kind of give me a little bit more coverage in the front but around the house once I start cleaning, I definitely go down to the Kami because I tend to get hot and I guess I'm just not like everybody else. I remember shopping with my mom recently. And she doesn't live near me but when I was in town visiting and she was saying something about well, it's not really the time of year to be buying short sleeve shirts or something. So for me, it's always the time for sure sleeve shirts. I do wear sweaters and jackets and coats when I go out, but I don't	1.0

Need to go to a diner on one of those guys and there's a reason for it. It's because I went to Africa to shoot a documentary and I was working with a really brilliant guy called dynein Manda and he found he's an Australian Navy clearance diver. Also who founded the International anti-poaching Foundation and he started the first all-female run from the anti-poaching Rangers to the managers to the staff to the H all female run from Broken backgrounds abandoned by their tribes and Villages domestic abuse women and he's down in them together to fight poaching in Africa and I was there filming with him and he didn't eat me and that just blew my mind. I'm like why the hell would you like one big and I'm like what the hell is happening? I don't think me and I said why you know, I grew up. I love meat. I eat ate all the kangaroos in the world and he said we'll look I was out here trying to protect the animals and then I go home and I'd eat the animals and I felt like a hypocrite and that kind of run of bell with me and I thought well shit, I'm doing that with the oceans and I'm eating animals and I hate hypocrites, you know in the military were trained to lead by example to do as I do not as I say and so I always drive to be that sort of person so I can't justifiably go out into the world and say hey you need to protect sharks and look after our oceans and look after our environment if I'm going home and I'm contributing to the destruction and so very very slowly and I'm talking very slowly. I started canceling out different things and expanding my repertoire of vegetables and Grains and all that sort of stuff and I've been plant-based for nearly four years now and I love it. I'll never go back why I thought feel healthy strong. I didn't lose any muscles, you know, I didn't grow boobs for meeting so food, and I haven't had a single injury training in four years. So I'm Happy I'm strong. But at least I've got vegan barbecue. I'm screwed.	1.0

Alright, so If you guys don't know already if you've watched any favorite TV shows like Simpsons family guy Futurama American Dad. I don't know if they really predicted anything. Yeah stuff like cartoons. Yeah older cartoons. Yeah, all these cartoons and all these shows have actually had an addiction to something that happened in the future a couple years after the show like that episode as are Simpsons they think the creator of it is a time traveler, which would make sense. He's predicted like 18 to 20 things. And hold like life work like doing it. One of the biggest ones was the Mitt Romney thing where he was trying to vote for Obama and it kept going it was the machine that kept voting for Mitt Romney. There's that one. They predicted 9/11 early so that it was that they are becoming president. Yeah, that one they predicted 16. No. Yes, 16 years. They had the exact same place. He was at like as it was happening all the other thing they predicted which was really interesting was the God particle. I don't know if you guys know that one, but they had like Homer Simpson was writing on a board and he had I guess it was really close to the exact equation that was used to Sorry for the actual God particle, and I don't know how I don't know about me. But you put that together that if it says that close to the God particle, you might have you might be thinking something. You know what I mean?

We usually exposed what we've been doing lately. We used to expose 25 to 30 of them depending on you know, a couple of things just how well I like the young men remember a little bit ago. I talked about exposing young fillies, you know for three four year old Phillies. Well, depending Come on, how many I want to put in those into the system for you get a cold out of so but to answer your question directly. Yeah, 25 to 30 of them. And then generally that means that you'll get you know, they'll they'll be a few measures that don't get bread. So you'll I usually shoot to have 20 calls a year at least 20, you know 22 you'll end up with so if you exposed 30 mares, ideally you'd get 30 calls, but generally speaking you're going to get 25 or 26 right in that area and then and then same same deal as finally read exposed 25 meters. It's more like, you know, you know right around 20 to 21 22 and then there's been years like I Beretta I studied calvary's a couple years ago. Tiger Warrior actually, he's are really really great blocker and really bread well and when we breath tiger Warrior, I put him with 20 mares because that was the deal we made. Made with those guys and heck. I think I only ended up with 13 goals. And that was it that wasn't tiger Warriors fault or anybody's fault. It was just one of those things where that was year was real wet and rainy and and not lost sunshine and the mayor's didn't circled. I'm sorry didn't cycle that well, and and so it wasn't all his fault. It was just one of those things that have Mother Nature. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, I when I talk to our vet around home here, and he said he was having trouble. Even getting like the cut and horses and reining horses in the people in the with the saddle horses around he was trying to having hell getting a the mayor's ovulate for him, you know, so it was just one of those Springs. It was just a tough.	0.0

Ring well, it's very exciting. And I guess it's something that I was a little bit naive probably being in Brisbane in the capital city. We had plenty of options when we started for hiring Furniture. So that that wasn't a limitation, you know, it was our real limitation was how much what you know, what happened we quickly could we build relationships with agents how quickly could we actually win some work and whatever work we were able to win it was either going to be constrained by you know, how many employees we had or how you know how we're going to actually fulfill. The orders whereas now I've met more people from Regional centers or rural sort of places something that didn't even cross. My mind was that there aren't even options to hire furniture and a lot of those places is that was that the case for you?	1.0
Well, so are the way our schedule works is, you know, obviously if Some of the NFR then we don't do anything until the end of March as far as rodeos are concerned. I don't go to Texas or anything like that. I just use a stay home and Buchholz and do that kind of thing for how my program works is I will I turn to start out March 1st. I leave I leave our studs out for 45 days to 60 days depending on you know, how the weather you know, like I If there's like a feel like they've got two good Cycles. in then then that's when I pull them if if I don't feel like that then in I just I anyway I just want to make sure that I get them covered and I try and do it within two months if I miss if the stud Miss isn't there, I just absorb it and I don't worry about it because I don't need Colts too late because again, it could screw your deal, but I messed up my schedule because I booked the mirrors that I breed and and how I do it is so A good example is like wild and blue and tnf are just a couple of months ago or three months ago, whatever it's been now and she had a cult couple days ago some so she you know, so the turnaround time is so she's bucking the pmf are you know, eight and a half nine months bread. But then she'll she you know has these this winter off. She has her Colton case. I live in California. It's pretty nice where we live it's cold right now, but for the most part it's not too bad in the winters. She'll have she'll have, you know have her cult usually and February or 1st of March and then I will only leave the Colts with the mayor's from Fort same deal as the as the breeding cycle 45 to 60 days and then I and I ween them called too young and I A month as much hay as they'd like as much like they have free choice Alfalfa and then I feed them grain and cast Mana to get them going and and it does two things. It gets my mayor back on the road so I can get a rodeo on again. But it also makes you cold it's good to be around and pretty gentle. So, you know, they come they come to feed and and and they get used to being around people. So they're not they're not real wild went for later on and and then they don't get a little go ahead you obviously they get free choice Alfalfa and good feed but you don't have a problem with them growing just like from not being with her mom. Actually we've done it we've done a test because you've had I've had that question happen a lot and I've actually had the cult that Our on on hey and calf man and grain outperform the Colts that are on the mayor still I'll be done. Yeah, and and I think that's because we don't know how much milka mares producing you think, you know, but you don't know how much the calls getting and and so, you know, it's no different than the cow-calf deal the cow-calf guys, you know, you'll have Pals that always bring in a calf at a great wing and wait and then you got not count bring in a calf with a very good weaning weight. So you just can the cow or whatever they do and get a different cow. Well, it's not that way in the Bucking Horse World where you don't just because America doesn't produce good milk. That doesn't mean we don't want to keep raising cold side where we just going to find a different way to take care of that baby and get big and strong because you know, the maternal ability might not be there on that matter, but the Bucks in them, right? So we got to kind of and going back to what we were talking about earlier this Rocking horse deal isn't like the Bulls deal. You know, it's it's a lot harder. I mean that they just they're so there to get a really shiny bucking horse. It takes a lot of lot of breeding and and a lot of luck and a lot of work. We're in the bull deal. I don't I don't want to discredit the bull deal because it's and say that it's easy. I don't mean it like that because it's hard as well because you only get like half your cash crop, but at the same time You can go and and you know breed Mudslinger to a Houdini daughter and you're gonna have a pretty good chance of a cast that box. I mean pretty good chance, you know, sorry.	0.0

So today I worked from home and when I work from home, I'll bring him to the bus stop like in a hoodie and my flip-flops sometimes and then come back and maybe get back in bed if I can or if I have work to do just start doing work, but it's just a little bit more comfortable. Like I don't have to race to the bus stop but most days I bring them to the bus stop and immediately leave like tomorrow and I just get on the train and I get to work but I am not at all awake in the morning and what wakes me up is my temper at them not being awake.	1.0

It was the race was only a couple of years old at that point and I remember I ran out of water in 2013 I ran out of water going About the halfway point which is a really tough section because you you're alone for 22 kilometers and then but yeah, so ever since then I'm a lot more on to it with with what I'm going to like. I'm onto it more with just everything. I've learned a lot more about running about the course and about pacing and so yeah, so this year was it was it was a good run for me wasn't perfect. But I don't think they'll ever be a perfect race, but I'm very pleased with my time and I thought I might take you through a little bit and if I know there's some fruit if 10 is perfect.	1.0

I'm just always every time but I've kind of always thought about it or talked about it. We kind of went back and said I don't know if that even is something that would work. So I mean it's interesting to what's good to hear that for yourself in the area or in that it has been received well, and it's just maybe somebody out there needs to try it and maybe we'll keep watch with interest.	1.0

So I start raising my vibration. It's been three months in and my whole reality my whole life starts to pick up like crazy like all these toxic people just get strands are leave my life and then like my parents who are extremely negative and toxic or completely transformed like everything starts to go good my Following blows up in everything and everything's just getting better and better and better and better and better and whatever right but one of the craziest things I noticed lately is my own inner self talk like what I what I can catch myself just hyping myself up nowadays. Nowadays, once I wrote raise my vibration consistently now, I'm like my own biggest fan now. I'm just like my gosh like damn. You're fucking fantastic.	1.0
We basically ran some we've talked about this. We weaponized TV.	1.0
But if you're setting an amazing example, yeah, you guys will never forget that tour and even if there was like some tension between choreographers or if something wasn't working and everyone was getting like kind of frustrated. How come I can't get this stuff red wherever he went into the room and right away. His presence just makes Feel like I got this like he's just such a positive person.

We think of all the things we need to do and you know it, you know, like my resting face is not a good one. I'm just going to say right so I mean being aware of that or my thinking face know I'd had students got missiles. Are you mad I'm like no. I'm just thinking, you know, but it looks like a mat that is all looks the same sometimes but you know, we just be kind of aware of that we But we have a big to-do list as teachers, but I think at the top of that list should be make really good human beings.	1.0
I know what you're saying. I mean you are you know, and as teachers, you know, we can also model this and obviously honor did and I'm sure you are as well. But as we are walking in the hall and we see up here, you know make eye contact and smile and say good morning or good afternoon or or something like that. I think that you know, I I know that you know, I've been in a lot of schools to where you know, you have teachers to get together and you know, when you get a group of girls together, sometimes sometimes we're not so nice and but sometimes you know, you see this kind of get-together chat chat chat or a teacher will be having the students come in and another teacher will join in and ask a question. And then meanwhile, there's interaction students are watching that so if we are if we were showing kindness to whoever is here, or if that conversation is anything less than kind about maybe a little gossip going on right students are noticing this so Be the person you want to see in your classroom. And of course, there's all types of great books out there on kindness and being paying it forward and you know being a good human. So those are things that we're going to want to incorporate in our classroom, but I think reading the books and checking that off. The list is not enough right? It's not enough to show, you know, the person that we want to	1.0
Okay, I wasn't doing anything wrong.	1.0

Whether it's Jack's. Oh my God, or the paste where my to you.	1.0
Yeah, it was crazy. Well like my whole experience with Christianity stemmed from my friend group. Like I wasn't raised a Christian I was raised and like just a very loving secular home and religion wasn't talked about and so, you know actually like First experience with Christianity happened when I was 12 years old. I was in my seventh grade science class and we were learning about Evolution exempt these two girls got so mad and they were like, what about Adam and Eve? What about the Garden of Eden? Like how can you be teaching this stuff in a public school? Like they were so mad and I was like, who are you talking about? Like who's Adam? Who is Eve? Like I didn't I was so ignorant. Ignorant and so I think at that point I kind of like became their salvation project and I was starting from like a blank slate like I didn't know anything about religion really and so I kind of just accepted that what they were saying was true and my parents never wanted to tell me like what to believe or what not to believe but that kind of lead to like an unhealthy. Like one-sided argument that was like filling my brain coming from my friends and I didn't like I don't know. I didn't necessarily critically think too much about it.	0.0
I have an approach sometimes it works is a good motivator. If I'm out is really struggling to define the energy to get out the door. I'll find a really good audio book or a really good point cast and I'll say I'm only allowed to listen to it when I run over as the only done and so that way I go are really one of us to that podcast. I better go for a run and then it gets me out the door and then once I've started yeah, yeah getting started is the hardest part half the time, you know, so. But yeah, but I mean it's yeah, it's really live in a good time. It enlightens time having all these like so many entertainment choices when they're out running and I think but the same time it is good just to tune in on itself. Like we're sort of going in and out of our own mind here this conversation like what but I think whatever works best, you know, like yeah, I agree.	1.0
But you you hit your stride. The investors were like really grilling you I mean like they were asking the right questions like imagining different use cases. Is for your product like did you think things were going?	0.0

An idea like some scripts you read you just like this is incredible other scripts you read like hmm, you know, I could see it working. If and then some scripture read. I mean most scripts. I read them like this terrible, you know, I mean you spend most of your time saying no, but you know, you just try to get to those the mid-range ones because the reality is some scripts you read and it's like the concept is there it's not quite executed on paper, but If you get these four actors together, you ain't got to worry about it because they're gonna go boom and do their thing.	1.0

Stella Jane. Okay, probably gonna Ronis. I love it the the silhouette of it the design just all of it together. It's just amazing. I liked it. I did plastic.

I'm not saying it looks I'm by no means giving it's a thumbs up just not like I'm not like floored by it. I love the hair. I want to know who does her wigs because every one of her wigs is so beautiful. I'm like, oh I want that way Sparkles. Hmm gotta follow them on Instagram. They're gorgeous.

Yeah, that's why I it's fine. Well, you're wrong. I mean you're kind of wrong about that.	1.0
Yes. Stop grunts. A moral of the story is I would think everybody has some form of anxiety and I think if you were saying no, you're kind of full of baloney because I think any denial Lingus you're doing here in denial is not everywhere in Egypt. Yeah Egypt. Yes. Anyway home and gen Wu I would say yeah, I mean On everybody is affected by it, you know obviously severity is going to change to you're not alone. I think that's the most important thing and three if you need help ask for help, like there are people there that to help you there are there are resources all over the place. I'm sure we could probably pull up a list of yeah, but put a list of resources together. That would be good for no notes who we show notes. We're also going to have some we have some in fact check. Yeah, there's no facts here. This is all just opinion. Actually we should probably	1.0

You will I promise that like just take it from my experience and man you get to this place where it's just like man. It's crazy. It's crazy. And I found this by accident like I've never been like man, I want to love myself. I never even knew what that meant. But like I've realized lately. Oh my gosh, this is what self-love is. So I can't wait for you guys to do this vibrational work like once you once you raise your vibration consistently all the good things start to come. Until you're just overwhelmed with this positive momentum. Because because of the Law of Attraction you're either going more and more towards negative or more and more in the positive direction. You're going one way or the other this train is going one way or the other. so Thank you for listening. In a few weeks. I should be have my online free online Academy up. It's it's just a video course with me talking about everything. I know about vibrations everything that I taught here in Moore from A to Z in a comprehensible way lesson. The lesson lesson I break down every concept video by video and You will be able to learn just everything just about everything that I know and they're in a very organized way. So you're able to put together the pieces and raise your vibration yourself. So, thank you.	1.0

So I think my biggest takeaway from that. Was that putting food in your body that's going to actually energize you. And make you feel good.

You might even be able to get away without you know with not sweeping if you either don't have kids or if you have a dog that's good at picking up after your kids. We typically need to sweep every day. We just do if you can't relate. I'm sorry, but that's an everyday thing.	0.0
Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone and forcing yourself into something that's just not meant to be. Hmm. So I do believe it's up to the person to push themselves in a way where it still feels like overall. There's a positive benefit here, right? Because sometimes exercise does push us and it you don't always feel great and you should push yourself, but if you I truly think if you are tuned into yourself in a in a profound way. You can tell what's an exercise that is like comfortably pushing you to be better and stronger and something that's actually just going to hurt you or is just not right for your body. So again, it's up for each person to decide what what that is. I love that. I really love that.	1.0
I actually Michelle's not I'm finding myself saying this more this season. I don't know why but I actually kind of agree with her because I felt like it was a very it was kind of like let's create a theme that can be anything. So we don't have to be as specific we can kind of do this and we can kind of do that we can kind of do this. So, I think that was kind of her point and I did kind of agree with that because it was it was like there was an alien, baby. Baby that you could touch but then there were moons and stuff. And then there I don't know. It did seem a little it didn't seem as cohesive as the hive which I know we will get into and I have notes about it, but I liked it and I agree.

Can I say you can take you got your good girl, you're fine saying kick ass, and there's no problem. So she's like a real contact one.

Yeah speak what if there was solo ranks, but also team-based rank in matchmaking so you can have a matchmaking, but I do miss Turner. Keep your pants on no, I'm wouldn't be sick though. I mean then it would be like because the big issue is now like we're we're sort of incentivizing Gamers to play Four frags, but the way to incentivize Gamers to play for actually in roles for teams to win is to reward teams, you know, so if you stick with the core group of five and you have a team ranked right versus an individual rank, it aligns incentives to play better Counter-Strike collectively for	1.0

If you want to break it up we can do like in the past and then present if you want to do it like that, but I want to definitely let you take the floor on this one go ahead and when they came off some of your favorite producers anybody who inspired you anything like that now I ain't gonna wiggle wiggle wiggle	1.0
So I was glad to see the Dancing with the Stars was something that you were able to yeah, it really is do it was so great because thing was Derek story was my first tour ever and it was hard because it was three months long with the preparation and everything and that meant I had to move to California for just a little bit for the rehearsal period and being that we live in New York not to see him for three months was Only extremely difficult so he did come out and see me like time to time. But of course, it's not the same when you're living together know right away the moment I got Dirk's called to be on this tour Tasha said I don't care what you do. You're not even going to think about you're doing this tour. He's like it's not just for you. It's for us because we want the world to see way more basically ballroom dancing has been seen as all Glitz and glamour, you know, that's and rhinestones and which is great but great hands. Right and at the same time like even in our competitive career whenever we danced Ballroom, it was really more pedestrian type of Ballroom where you get up and you wear jeans and t-shirts and you make it sexy without all the rhinestones which we saw in World of Dance right season 2. Yes, exactly. And that's exactly what we wanted to deliver. So the fact that I was able to kind of go into Derek store and like really fresh out of the competition floor and just do what I love to do and just kind of Be as partner on tour, which was great at the same time. It was just so great for Pasha and his family. So it was it was definitely something I shouldn't have thought twice about but the only reason I did thought think twice about it was just because Pasha was in New York.	1.0
Yeah. I remember I think one of the first it's sort of funny the whole running the race photography like rice photos and really interesting because with the Advent, I don't know if you ever do parkrun or anything like that and I don't do it as often not your thing, but I know there's no path one here.	1.0

You don't share a lot of experiences and you know. Just enjoy we both both my cousin's we literally can just be in bed. Chill together eat good food. Have a good workout and just do the simple things in life. And it really doesn't matter what we do when I'm with them. It's just as long as we're together and I think that's the beauty of it is. It's very low maintenance, you know, just as long as we have each other we find gratitude in that and it's always a good time, you know, but with you know, Richard Nico both of them, you know, they Have they're like my best friend's, you know, they've been my best friends ever since I was younger and you know, keep it real with you guys, you know, as you get older things change feelings change people change. There's a lot of movement in life. And sometimes you forget about the people that helped you get to where you are and I think for me by my you know, the blessing my mom. She had told me a couple weeks ago that because it's miss me and and I wanted Create consistency and effort and shows them that I miss them too. And I know it's been hard and I know it's hasn't been things. Haven't been the same. So it's kind of like having that body bit about bodybuilding mentality, like whatever your weak points are in a relationship like focus on those like all the people in Sacramento. Like I see them consistently. I see my baby girl Cindy all the time. I see Kev, you know weekly, you know, it's about maybe investing time in to the people that you don't see a whole lot like I don't see my sister's a whole lot. My nephew's a whole lot my cousins a whole lot. So I think this year I definitely want to have a better goal of strengthening the relationship those types of relationships.	1.0

And that is of course that creates a big problem not for the people who are working close to the printing press so people working on financial markets people working in the government and so on but it's a problem for the economy as a whole especially for the weaker parts of the economy, right Working Class People people jobs very much removed from financial markets from the banking industry and so on and we should expect their you should be to observe not in pain. Parchment then indeed.	0.0

Evenly when I start this with my teams. They all look at me as if I am treating them like children around the second or third week. They get more excited and their answers get weirder as they become more comfortable with everyone. This reinforcement bonds them all and gives them things to talk about A Works towards my value of the team getting along. It's weird. How much to girls can Bond over both loving turquoise discipline. You've already created rules and discuss them both with your players as well as their families. Everyone is on the same page. Let's say you have some pretty basic rules like no kicking the ball. No swearing no side conversations during Huddle's Etc. So what happens when one of your girls gasp breaks one of these rules, this is a major decision. You need to make before the season. Ins because the first time it happens it sets a precedent. Are you going to let it slide? Will you give out warning after warning yet do nothing about it in the end or will you stop everything and send your players to the service line and make them run until you think you get the point across drop in the middle of a match and do push-ups as former players. We probably all experienced differing disciplinary Styles coming from our coaches maybe even differences from the same coach depending on their mood the head coach may have been extremely strict while the assistant was. Mainly there to encourage the girls on your team while you don't come into your first season wondering what sort of punishment your team will serve for various offenses. It is something you need to decide on make sure your other coaches are on the same page. Not sure where to start think about this. The whole point of discipline is to make your girl stop some sort of behavior. Usually one. They know they shouldn't do but decide to engage in any way. The best punishment is one that they do not want and will therefore try to avoid some rules one, bro. Are more detrimental to the team than others kick a ball out of the way when peppering not good, but likely just a reflex give them a warning Buddha ball across the gym after missing a dig. She's sitting out no questions asked which leads me to my next point my personal approach to rule-breaking is this you break a rule you sit out everyone knows the rules and I don't have the time or patience to give warnings in very rare circumstances. I'll give a warning but because my team's know that I'm a no-nonsense coach when it comes to breaking the rules warnings are rarely necessary while different age groups will have different kinds of rule-breaking you need to decide on punishments which are consistent with your temperament and coaching style. I don't personally agree with punishments such as running lines push-ups laps. What have you this gives those activities a negative connotation and I want my girls to want to do those things to be in better shape. I do make one exception to running as discipline simply because a former coach of mine used it and I think it's genius Swearing was not allowed on the team. And if someone decided they were going to cuss the entire team will get mad at them. But why why would a player be mad at another player for breaking a rule depending on the number of letters in the word of choice? That is how many laps the team had to run but wait, it gets better the person who swore would stand in the middle of the court or jam and count the number of laps out loud for the rest of the team. My old coach used pure pressure against us to curb our attitudes I can Practically guarantee that if you implement this rule with your team swearing will be minimal whatever disciplinary policies you decide on make sure you stay consistent in your enforcement of the rules. Just because one of the girls who has never once gotten in trouble is having a side conversation during a huddle do not let it go fairness is something girls are very sensitive to particularly when they feel it is going against them giving up the perception of playing favorites can be just as damaging to their trust in you as if you are actually playing favorites. Practice design one of the topics I'm most passionate about when it comes to volleyball is practice design organizing skill practice and game like drills in a way that builds up and culminates in proper skill execution is vital to running a successful practice. It is crucial that you spend more than just a few minutes coming up with practice until you are a seasoned coach and even then you'll probably spend more time tweaking drills to make practice just right. So let's talk about practice design what I mean by practice design is the a flow of your practices from one major category of skill work or Play Games Etc on to the next to begin. You always need to warm up. This should take roughly 10 minutes for each practice to make sure your girls have warmed up their muscles properly the rest of how you spend your time will vary depending on how long your practices are with younger players practicing for shorter amounts of time usually and can be broken up as follows Dynamic stretching stretches that make your players move warm-up game a game. That gets the players moving and playing volleyball but uses them into play there should not include scrimmaging and should limit full serves or attacking right away games with a lot of movement are ideal skill demonstration and concept introduction explain a new skill or concept for this example. I'll use jousting Jousting is one two players on opposing chords go up to direct a ball that is tight to the net and could end up on either side. This may be too advanced for younger teams, but is a good skill to practice. Of 12 and under or middle school volleyball explanation should take no longer than five minutes unless it is very complex skill or concept specific drill. Now you run a drill which focuses on the new skill or Concept in our case jousting and sure you are running a drill which is slow down enough to focus on good technique, but quick enough to get a lot of touches on the ball and keep their attention game like activity which incorporates skill or concept similar to the warm-up game. We're not getting into full-on scrimmage. Out here. We just want to put the girls in a game situation in which has everyone practicing jousting as if it were happening in the game playing a short Court game where players can only tip will help the jousting situation arise more often old / familiar skill demonstration. Since Jousting is not typically one of the first skills you cover you are probably a few weeks or a month into your season by the time this comes up your team should be familiar with their defensive positions by now so you can review defense at this time. Sighs tip coverage as this is related to jousting scrimmage, which incorporates both skills and or concepts now is the time you get to test out how well your players have grasped the new information you have given them by running a full scrimmage. You are allowing your players to get in the habit of implementing their new skills in a way that would naturally occur in a game. Not one that is forced or predictable cool down. Your players have probably put a lot of effort into the last 15 to 20 minutes of practice and need to ease into their normal state. Cooldowns do not need to take very long but should not be skipped. Also, it's very important to incorporate water breaks for the team. If someone is thirsty during a drill that you should also allow them to get water right away schedule these in but make sure your players know that they can get water at any time. This is a safety issue. This does not by any means have to be followed religiously at every practice. However, if you are struggling to create a schedule for your practice in this might be a great place to start some nights, you may also have skills, which do not easily work. Whether using this framework, for example, you need to work on serving and setting it can be hard to make these two skills. Mesh.	1.0
I start tripping out a lot, but I've been really noticing like who I spend time with and who I talk to and there are a lot more people that I talk to who I may not see that regularly Beyond people in like my 12-step meeting and they're all great and I really really go to them and they're such a source of like infrastructure when I just need another brain to Noodle on an issue with me.	0.0
So that gives you a little bit of an idea of who we are where perspectives are coming from souter and I we've been married for a year and a half.	1.0
But yeah, so so here's my idea is right. Okay, I love them through and entertainment like movies TV shows talk about what's going on in that range of things. Straight talking about like what movies are doing good movies aren't doing good that kind of thing. And then my second idea is music. Like the music realm I guess we could get into music to an extant has that is definitely the other things going on in the wrap in the rap culture right now, like not even just rap.	1.0
Anyway. All right, Matt. Do you remember the game all yeah, it was it was it was really frustrating in I think it was one of those those games that we've seen previously where we did. I think we would have played or not and not scored or just never look like leave. Again, it came in the 92nd 93rd minute. Yeah, 12 minutes and I'm very very very light is the Fantastic header. What a late that was the other similar chance today against Sheffield United worries a lot of standing jump or not jump Center off. It's a great leap. And yeah, it was good obviously very important to get the three points now that now that we've qualified so that's all that really matters isn't it rather than the performance the trailer I put the ball in for?	1.0
Well, it was just I'm going to counter that with he supposed to become. Tree and so that's supposed to be kind of like that's true vernacular. Like he wouldn't call my league daughter but like saying son is a little more I guess normal. It's good point. I'm okay with that. The line cut-offs were funny. I don't know if you noticed that too. There were a couple times like Oliver would start to like say that like he started to say a poem at one point and then they like cut him off and like he was like, oh, let's think of what's a rhyme for something and maybe white.	1.0

This 250 I want to raise a much larger round relatively speaking and really go and really own this market Sterling is wanting to raise the 250 now to help them get to profitability with the plan of raising a much larger round in 2018. Sterling has made his pitch now it's decision time. Here's Daniel is how I feel which is I I'm a huge believer in Sterling Smith the founder. I think you're super Scrappy. I think you've pulled together a team on not that much money and you've frankly built a product that I think at least looks great relative to the other, you know, many quasi competitors or similar products that I've seen in the market my my I'm going to hold off on committing here because my biggest question is Good size. So I don't yet know how big if you get 50% market share or 20 percent market share of your target retailers. And I think all businesses need to start somewhere. I get the we're going after Nan retailers and I get that, you know story but I think you're going to have to nail your target sort of mid-market retail segment. First So my answer is I think it's really interesting. Would love to connect with you after the fact on Market size. Excellent. That's Amelia actually there. Really good segue to my control, which is I want to invest in a company where I can pour fuel on the fire where you have a scalable way of acquiring customers and I can add money to it that will let you explode that that's not here yet. Plus I'm afraid you're not raising enough money. You're going to go back and raise again, very soon. Your focus is going to have to be on fundraising and not on sales and marketing. I appreciate that and and that that's a distraction to me. That's a distraction. I'm concerned about for you.	0.0

Yeah, that might be cut short in. Everybody's hands as well. But yeah, I think we've killed mean obviously with him being that Futsal player. They're going to be quite good on the ball and so on. I think you look really comfortable especially today is Sheffield United even with the aerial Jules. I didn't do too badly will give you books up a little bit which will happen. Naturally. It could be a really good player because positioning and that he's got the they've got the football brain. You can say that it's just physically he's it isn't found a little bit wanting still but he's a big boy, and he thought I said I put a bit of size and I'm like the dummy of the pies are never as you look at pictures from when they saw into.

She goes art. I'm finally going to make a stand the paparazzi are right outside her door when how they even got into Riverdale High terrible, especially for a new team new principal that's all about order and discipline and they came from all different angles. It's already mr. Honey, you've failed but they show up at veronika's home and she slams The Door in the compose herself for a moment and then opens it up and says, you know, I'm only going to give one statement and it's going to be the beginning and end of anything I have to say, but I'll only do it at Le Bon Nuit Speakeasy and there will be a special performance after they will have a press conference after my performance. So we have these poor journalist, but I can't I mean I can't say poor journalist because there's the other just invading a high school, you know senior year high school students life to get whatever salacious Coop they are. They're dirty. They're Sleazy and there's coming.

Well, I remember I forgot what year it was, but it was in December of one year that I was talking to the people from the after-show and back then I think Steph was kind of like you're not supposed to talk about it. Like it was already starting to get to that point but it wasn't as bad as it got with the rest of the show because they wanted me to get on that show. Show and I was talking to like the people behind that and I was supposed to be on that show and then it kind of stretched a few months. Like I was supposed to be on in December and then that got rescheduled there was some sort of like internal problem with the filming or whatever. So then it was rescheduled to like March or something. And then when we got to March it was like, oh, you know this guy handed off to different people like different Executives that took control over it and then I was kicked off.

No appointments. You've nothing going on for the first half of the day and then the next thing you know these guys but they're they're all awake at 6 o'clock in the morning. But but on of course on the on the school day, it's a nightmare to get these guys up and I think that's a human thing though.	0.0
And I agree and that's kind of the thing. I've been kind of working on for weeks. And you look at the to Iowa tight ends. I said, no laughs and is Jordan Reed 2.0 T. Jay Hawkins kind of Chris Cooley or me is ceiling would be like a Jason winner Greg Olsen, but I think Fant your said is much more Dynamic his Arias of nine point eight nine. His combine was absolutely incredible and he was a pretty good player for a long time and I will Hawkins to really broke out last year, but fantas been doing it for two three years now and Kirk Ferentz players tend to do pretty well in the end. Whether it's George Kettle, we've seen Now setting records or Scott Shannon had a nice long career in the NFL as well. So Iowa tight ends tend to do pretty well in the NFL and I think there's a solid chance as well that one of them will be in Green Bay for me personally. I am actually in Amber with Brian Burns and all those concerns about his frame and everything, but the Packers need that edge Turner we look at the Smiths. They're very very good players, but having a guy with the speed and build of a Brian Burns gives it that extra dynamic. Thing where you could have all three of them on the field and really cause problems with that as well. But like you said there are so many guys in play at 12 and maybe even trading down into the late teens to get fans or treating up from 30 to get fan because I would be surprised if they take 10 players with with the capitulate is and with with the chance to really get some special players. I think they might trade up a couple of times on maybe they won or at the very least day to as well. Well, I think said to do you think you want to maybe hop into a little bit of a mock draft here before for us?	1.0
Yeah, there's this Christian who I actually really like I mean, I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I really like him and his name is Sean McDowell and he gave like this really cool talk where he pretended to be an atheist at a Christian college and he put on his atheist glasses me like talk to them as if he was an atheist giving all of like, you know, the atheist answer. is I guess and for the most part I thought he did a pretty good job, but then he kind of like took his glasses off and was like, like how do you guys think you did and it was just it was like how did you feel when you were being like questioned by me and like you weren't really winning the argument so to say like and they were like like I was mean to you like I was aggressive and I was defensive and you know, I felt attacked and I just wanted to prove you wrong so bad. Like I wasn't being loving through that and he his point was basically like Christians shouldn't be scared of Doubt because they should be a Christian because they believe that it is true. And if it after all of the research that you do if you come to the conclusion that you don't think it's true. Then you shouldn't be a Christian and he said that's okay you like you have to not be afraid of just pouring all the facts.

Yeah, so I do have that Cameron my office but it's cool because so my grandpa always had these really cool RCA like cat, you know Tech and quote or air quotes at the time this was you know, early 90s and he would always fill my brother and I doing like riding bikes and doing these karate shows and magic show that karate shit is a sick. I want to see one of those now you don't and so bad so It was really cool because you know, he would set the camera down and then guess who gets to play with it me true. So yeah, so I was like, I always saw him with a camera and I looked up to him so much man. Like you have no idea how much I looked up to him and he kind of kind of did was that father figure for me for a while and he passed away and no one but anyways besides that he was just he was a very much an influence on my life. So I knew that he was he was successful and and his career in his field. So I kind of saw that and kind of took the leap forward as well.	1.0
I think. Every time I feel like just crazy crazy anxious, especially at night. It seems like it gets really bad at night. I'll watch an episode of like schitt's Creek or the office or something. That's like just I kind of know what's gonna happen. The characters are comforting to me and afterward it kind of like get your mind off of it and then afterwards it's like, all right, maybe this wasn't so crazy after all I also have the Calm app the daily corium. When I pay you for like the yearly thing or whatever and they have like a daily calm every day that's like 10 minutes and you do this calming thing and they have a bunch of different other like series on there too, like tackling anxiety and means meaningful eating mindful eating and just different things like that that it's so funny because you said like listening to Christian music and it feels very like woo or like just kind of corny or Shay. Yeah, well, you're just like okay, I do a meditation but that stuff really does help and it really makes a difference and I don't think there's anything wrong with doing it. I mean it but yeah, I've totally at first I was like this is so stupid. This is not going to help me but just like anything else if the more you do it the more it's gonna help you.	1.0
So one of the things that that I brought it at the point that I brought up before about how there was rioting in this new episode. The didn't really age well and like wasn't appropriate for children is that they continually use the word trans?	0.0

And I guess you're like you said, they're very complementary businesses. But at the end of the day, they're still two separate businesses and different. In the in the sense that although the obviously there's some crossover in the fact that you've got home Wares and things that you can use in staging as well one is still a retail store and one is a service. How do you find running two businesses that are very different at the same time?	1.0
I think they only did like two seasons. They weren't very for some reason. They were really good show but I'm surprised it only didn't like to season and then they took it off.	1.0
No, but they could hold on we do no, no, no, but even just because they can doesn't mean they should like I just feel like they're what do they say most most complain? I have my see those computers that play Counter-Strike may not be able to take advantage of 128 take, you know, like stuff like that that we don't think about Out, you know, I think I think there must their time could be used more effectively.

But I mean, that's there it is a funniest fucking Three I've ever heard when I think of like sex stories. None of that's ever happened to me. No, like that is some like what the fuck happened that night like you're gushing at the knee. I had some what the fuck happened and I wake up and I'm like, oh that was kind of psychotic but like yeah, nothing to the point where I also don't I don't have you ever used Tinder or like any of those apps know I like started dating Cody when that became cool. I've never like an iguana literally never had one. I think when I Freshman College. I made a tender and then like some man he messaged me and of course I'll got it was just so weird and I literally don't think I ever answered. I started dating someone and like never responded and just deleted it. So now I just don't have a tender. Can I also just say I like I'm not against like Tinder and people who online date but personally if I was ever single, I just don't think that's how I would want to meet someone. Yeah hit the bars hit the bars or the dog park. Yeah, you know Not that I've seen any Daddy's at the dog park, but but that's a natural way to need someone. Yeah, and I also think no Enjoy. Maybe the bar isn't always the best option. Yeah do something like a hobby that you enjoy. Yeah. Maybe it's someone's work out. I put see any time about the oh God meeting people know Jenna's where no, I think if you have a dog and you're single go to the dog park go to all the darts on Daddy's there. Yeah for sure. And usually a little off but whatevs. No, I definitely and I can I can say this like I have a boyfriend but there's definitely some handsome young men at the dog park. Oh, yeah sure and I'm sure a lot of them are single looking for a lady and they have don't hit it up who doesn't love a man with the dog half. The reason all my got happier. Okay. I'll say like point three percent of the reason. I love my boyfriend so much is because he's Golden Retriever and I are essentially a relationship. Yeah Cody has little I don't use my man. Dog, but but but it's a different. It's a place like if he had no animals like I don't know only love you a little bit less but not too too much. Oh, yeah, we had this we had this other girl who she wanted to her who this person is. Yeah. We don't know her name. She did like message. Oh, yeah, so she's just trying to she wants to shout out her her ex boyfriend who cheated on her. We don't know who she is, but gee. She's but we appreciate your content. Yeah, we do like a bear up in Lovin her ex-boyfriend had to dress up as a Playboy bunny and go to Hooters and we're all these different things like and she basically said so my cheating in all caps ex-boyfriend lost a super embarrassing bad for Halloween and someone was kind enough to bless me with all these pics. She sent some pretty amazing photos. I mean obviously seeing a man in a tight pink ones. He's always Amazing and then she just said gotta put that baby carrot on blast. So there it is. She's on blast. She won't let us follow her but I truly hope that we pay for her. Yeah, and we wish her the best she jumped the reason I like the reason we were saying this right now is because she just messaged me and it just said cheating loser of the week. Okay what I'm not really sure about these like dicks drawings. Yeah, I don't think that hitting us. Yeah, I mean like they're they're like they're funny. I don't know how old she is. Maybe we can chat later with her. Yeah, if she yeah, she said she wanted to stay private. I don't know. So maybe she's just not even a real person but it's fine fans supporters supporters. Always we love that not appreciate you. Can we do? All right guys? Well, this is getting a little lengthy. It's so lengthy. I hope you guys listen to this whole thing. Yes, I think this is our best one yet. I just get I just burped love that little baby burp. Thank you guys that you guys love you not or nine to fivers. Yes. Thank you for listening, and I will see you next week. Bye. So we wanted to mention a podcast of the week recently Andrea and I have been listening to the young and ambitious podcast by Sienna Marabella and Emily Duong. I don't know if I pronounced that right? Sorry if I didn't but they basically do kind of just like modern-day girlboss adulting type of podcast very motivational. They're just two young girls who share their Journey with you as well as keeping you motivated and informed on how to be be a modern-day girlboss. So we love them. Shout out to Young and ambitious podcast.	1.0
I'm like a battered girl and I'm just like, why do I love you? Because I mean like in general like Battlefield. That's the only reasonable not only reason I mean, there's plenty of reasons, but that's like one of the only reasons I didn't buy Battlefield 5 is the fact that EA has Been doing some really questionable things in the past. And I mean, I tried the beta out for Battlefield 5 and it was very much like okay, this is more Battlefield and it wasn't a bad thing necessarily. It's just that like when I looked at that plus all the other things coming out around it. I was like that $60 just ended up going somewhere else now technically now, I think I could probably end up picking up on like a really good deal or something, but then that's still like money that I'd have to put towards that instead of something.	0.0
Ideas that that's what we should like to yeah, and and you know, I do believe that there are people out there who are experts in nutrition and you know these different Medical paradigms, but somebody having a lot of Instagram followers does not necessarily mean that they know what's best for your body.	0.0
Don't have a coach. I've have never had a coach. I do things where I feel I guess. I don't have a plan as such I I know generally what I need to do like a long line of need to take it easy still if you interval sessions a week, but I don't if I have a set plan with this is what I'm doing each week and just kind of I can't really need to because life is hectic. I just have to fit around my daughter and my work as best as I can that are generally I'll do I do a lot of longer. ER well what I call mid-length runs so often I'll do a 20K run in the morning and then in the afternoon, I'll do strength training and all be fishing on the treadmill at the gym because I can take my daughter with me to cut. It has a bit of a muck around with the other cubes. And yeah, so that's right on the weekends. I usually do a longer run as well as I can but even so my long runs on the weekends. The time factor and not usually that long probably 40 K is most often even that long. Yeah, I know and so like let's go back in time.	1.0
So yeah, that's where everybody plays CrossFit comes from.	1.0
Like night-night doing on doing this. Yeah, I love it. So what's the advice that you would take from this episode?	1.0
I've never Read Moby Dick, you know, I was supposed to don't tell my ninth-grade literary T-shirt.	0.0
Yeah for personal loans, right?	1.0
I mean a certain way to felt like, okay and then but the first one that they played was just like we were just like, oh my gosh, we just both lists each other and burst out laughing.	1.0
Wow. The gold yeah, Argentina has been on top for soccer for a while because I mean it's such a big part of their lives.	1.0

I'm sorry. I got a contract with Discovery Channel to host Shark Week a couple of years ago. So I've been hosting shows on Shark Week. How good does that feel?	1.0
Yeah, don't don't take advice from somebody who just you don't let anybody who doesn't care about you somebody who cares about you and somebody who knows what they're talking about. The other thing I would say is don't sell yourself short. Try new things. Don't be afraid to go for something. Ready for it. Yeah, you'd be amazed at what you can do when you have two most people most people rise to the occasion. And the other thing is don't don't feel bad. If you don't know what you want to do. I had no idea what I wanted to do. So I went to a Julia business school, which that's what most women did in my day. I got my associates degree and I became a legal secretary. Yeah, you know it all worked out fine, but when I look back on it now. Yeah, I wish my parents had pushed me to go to a four-year College. I wished I had become a vet or something along those lines something to do with the animals. But to be honest, it's hard to know what you want to do when you enter college at the age of 18. Yeah, you have any regrets? I do and I regret is that I wished I had gone to a four-year College. I wished I had moved away from my parents home and get that. I think my life would have been totally different. Maybe I would have become a bit. Maybe who knows? Yeah. Sure.	1.0
And do I have to speak with a sales person or anyone before I start know so you come through so we want an IBM ux/ui award for the usability of our looks great.	1.0
Nothing, but fire. That's what I'm expecting. I'll speak nothing less than that. I love compilation album show. So I'm a sucker for a good one. So when that comes out, I'm I'm listening to as soon as Thomas pack some heat and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.	1.0
I don't think it's the vocals that bothered me.	0.0
Instagram and all this is so huge with this generation and people get this little peek into your life. That's all the more reason to be so much more careful what you're doing where you're at and where you guys are together because you know, maybe we see you're at the house together sit on the couch and there's other people around but we don't know and so now we all think you guys just hang out at the house together because that's what's on your Instagram, you know, and so then it leads us to believe we don't know where you draw lines. We don't know where you draw boundaries. And so now you've given off the appearance of evil because you know, we don't know the full backstory and so I would just say to somebody who's dating be so conscious of the fact that first of all you're an example to people that are younger than you your example to people that are around you especially if you're in the church, especially if you're a leader and you're somebody that people look to you know, everything that you display of your life in social media, you know, people are looking at and they're analyzing whether you whether you think they are not they're doing it and they're looking to there. Really looking for you to set a standard. You know, when we when we go when we used to go on trips with our with our work and we were working a secular job people would always come up in make jokes about us, you know, not drinking alcohol and be like, hey you want a drink you want a drink and of course, you know, we don't drink never have and that's not something that we want at all. It's not even a temptation. But you know, there was there's one person in particular that would always be like, hey, you know have a drink have a drink and I think I think back to all those times and I'm like, you know What if we actually would be like, you know what since you've offered it like 25 times sure why not that person would be so disappointed because the thing is people actually like clear set boundaries. They actually want to see you as a Christian live differently than them as the world. And so that's why you find people people that are unsaved they'll see somebody that was like a minister at a bar and then they're like, hey, why is that guy here? You know the unsaved person thinks it's strange that you as a Christian are trying to Gov and be like the world so so it's even more so you should be looking at your life and evaluating. Okay, what are the things that I need to be doing? Especially as a young single person especially as a dating Christian person. I can't look like the dating person that goes on vacation with their with their they're very, you know, their boyfriend or girlfriend. That's not what you do as a dating Christian that's just doesn't work and it's the biggest thing that came across from you when I spoke to	0.0
I just want to see if we have to say similar things about them because I kind of feel like we might yeah.	1.0
I think it comes down to being on a team and I think learning from each other which is what this podcast is all about learning from each other and helping teach others. I want to I want to leave it on a piece of advice from you Aaron. Do you have one piece of advice that kind of follows what we've been talking?	1.0
You know what I'm saying most times when you when you read a script. Do you know if the movie is going to be good at you?	1.0
Yeah, so as I mentioned before it's it's truly truly the heart. Work has been done by Justice Mesquita. I kind of just piggybacked off of him and but basically a couple years ago, he did a thorough study and evaluated the prospects that Green Bay tends to draft and the guys that they tend to drift towards when they're making their selections and I can honestly tell you they draft athletes for the most part. It's every single one of the positions has a couple thresholds, but they're pretty much all inclusive of basically speed agility and size depending on the position, but pretty much this is Speed and Agility. That's really all they're looking for. They don't care about strength. They don't care about a lot of other characteristics. I think quarterback offensive line and defensive back are and wide receiver. Those are the ones where they care about size for defensive line and Edge. There's this couple special calculations called. Oh my goodness. They're the basically their agility and speed calculations. The exact name of the calculations escaping me. It's not like a super well-known one. But if you ever want to know just reach out to me and I'll do a little bit of digging and I have it in my notes the gentleman who originated the formula, but basically there's a formula that calculates agility and speed using their three-cone time 40-yard dash their height and their weight and their certain threats certain thresholds that have been met in the past and certain thresholds that were looking for moving forward, especially with the Packers needing Edge help. Till I would say that they still need Edge help, you know, it's a good tool to look at and it's been a pretty good indicator and I know Justice Mesquita, he knows its edges, you know, he puts out those Force players every year. So they're pretty root pretty good indicators of relative success in the so I'm very excited to just keep updating it and updating it weekly currently with pro day numbers as new players who didn't test that the combine or players just who are improving on there. Numbers in general I'm pretty excited for what it's become and what it's growing into and definitely going to keep continuing this every year as long as the thresholds are going to hold true. Which last year. I think it was like seven seven of the players seven of the draft picks last year fell Within These thresholds, so I'm pretty excited for how predictive it was last year and what it might indicate this year.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
And then I remember it exactly how messy that was what it was because I remember the interview because I had a scheduled like webcam interview with two of the people. All that were in charge of that and they just like ask me a bunch of questions. So they've asked me like who's your favorite character? When did you start watching the show? What is your favorite thing about the show and literally my favorite character was Styles. I started watching the show when it first started airing like the very first episode I tuned in and I told them like my favorite part of the show is steric and they were like, why is that, you know, your favorite part of the show and I explain to them why I liked the two characters together and like Part of what shipping was like I gave them kind of like a like Outsider kind of information. So I didn't go into like depth as to what it was and they seem fine with it. Like they didn't seem like shocked they're like hesitant and then of you went fine, and then I guess I got handed down to the other people who were like no, but they did have a steric on they had it right when they changed president's yeah. They had a guy. Who was supposed to be doing like a game like a video game? Yes, and I never happen. I wonder why they probably got shut down or something and they were like you can't make this even though it was going to be like out of his own time and again nothing to do but the show but that game never came out. But I remember he had like video footage of like the first like be getting up. Game, yeah and looked fine. Like I was excited for it, but it never came out.	1.0
Probably in better shape for the program because you know, we had training and stuff like that because hi I'm learning. I mean we did have we trained for that but the track stuff on screen was you know, it was really limited. Yeah. Yeah, but the	1.0
Yeah, the teacher was literally about to light a match to and he's like, yeah.	0.0
So and but then we started looking back and he started showing me old footage and he helped me believe that I was that which I really think helped me mentally and kind of give me confidence and put me in the right direction of the position that I wanted to be in. Yeah, so so now I am a DP and I go by being a cinematographer.	1.0
I feel yourself a little bit, right?	1.0
Right? So again, like I told you earlier when I first came around went to work for Dawn Kish and and sure if anybody anybody knows anything about bucking bulls and those who've gone to issues and knows what he did for a lot of years and and So I worked around that outfit for a long time and you know, I learned a lot about bulls. I think I learned a lot about bubbles in it and with around a lot of bowls and a lot of cows and lot of All That Jazz. And there was a time when like in the late 90s when I first went around there and early 2000s when if you wanted really good Bulls you need to raise them. I mean, I think everybody would I think you'd be naive to say that in that period of time you needed to raise the goal is to get the kind you wanted that were that were beyond what everybody else had but as we all know through the last 15 years, it's changed, you know, the You know heck there's there's people showing up to those a BBI events that nobody's ever heard of that just flush the cow and put it with this did that and have a mother and had a really good bull, you know, I mean II am not and when I say really good, but I'm not talking about bushwhacker. I'm just saying they have both it turned back in the gate bucket or you know, 22-point Bull and it's somebody that's not really a bull person. They've just bred that way and and and not to try and get and I don't Mean it like this discredit people like they don't know what they're doing. I'm not saying that what I'm saying is it would be no different than me and going and Bryant buying a cutting horse out of highbrow cat and some fancy mayor, you know, I the Bloods there it's in them. So if you know, if you don't as long as you don't mess him up, you know, the Bulls are available and so forth for through just the supply and demand of the rodeo the kind of bulls we Rodeo with week, you know, you guys all know that we don't need both like, you know Long John rodeo with or frozen or whatever, you know, you don't need those but we just need you know, you just need good Bulls to turn back and guy can be 85 or better on and and and so for us what works when my wife Haley and I started Bridwell pro rodeo, you know and and here a couple of years ago. We just found for us. It was more cost effective just to buy the boats, you know with with raising them and that I just don't have the feed for him don't have enough country out here in California Every Little Bit of Country. I get I have to put the horses on because I can't afford to buy the high-end horses, but I can I can I can buy, you know, I have to raise those but I could I can match around and they're really good Bulls, you know, just for free.	1.0
I'm going to wait and take my shower in the evening.	1.0
Um, I don't know the exact moment. I feel like it was some sort of like obscure moment. Like I would post something and we get a lot of like notes fairly quickly. I felt like I knew I don't know. Maybe it was Posey gate with the whole like telling Posey's mom on me and like right now I don't like go through so much. Effort for a fan obviously.	1.0
So many things wrong so the game itself, obviously Braga took an early lead through a deflected goal through Andre jota jiminez, then equalized Doherty and adharma quickly made it 3-1 walls and the second half. We sort of collapse and it's paleo and Francis. Yo, I gotta go.	0.0
So hopefully you get the concept of everything that's good. Let's talk a little bit about Derek Hough because I'm sure let's talk about Derek because obviously he's had a huge history on Dancing With the Stars but Working with him really started with World of Dance where he was a judge for you. Do you think that he saw you and you know Pasha dance and it probably was thinking I want to work with these two at some point in the future.	1.0
So I I'm all for it. But I swear if he starts talking about right something else. I'm out. Yeah. No, I'm a very had the courage to come all I don't want to say anything that would offend anybody. But yeah, I mean good for him as long as he's happy that their else that's really old is I don't really care that he's gay like I like I don't really care. I don't really care like I'm still gonna listen to his music but like I'm saying if he starts rapping about like some fruity stuff like Yeah, that's gonna change his fan base is gonna look like very lot of like little 12 year old like little little like kids that listen to his music because their parents are not going to let them listen to that kind of stuff.	0.0
That's so interesting. Remind him I'll go segue into my one. I saw the limited Netflix documentary series about Bill Gates and I have to say it's absolutely I thought decoding in fact the inside the brain and Bill Gates decoding the brain of Britain.

I think it so I have a 20 year old 15 year old and 11 year old now the you know, I think any parent, you know the for the first thing you want your kids to be safe, right, you know, then you want them to feel loved and then you want them to learn right and to learn to teach themselves. And what I found is that like Parenthood is just like life. It happens in phase. It's like I've never been the father of a 20 year olds. This is a whole new part of the ride so I can you know what? I mean? It's like my daughters like ya next year for my birthday. We gonna have a drink and I'm like, wow, okay, she's gonna be turning 21 wide, right? And so I kind of and I'm and I'm I tell my kids that like, sometimes they come to me with certain things. I'm like, I don't know. I'm trying to figure this out like you are you know, but I think that's the challenge is to one of the other challenges is to sort. of unlearn generational You know patterns that you know that we just do is families or as black families or you know, so like for my kids never beat my kids, you know, I don't want them to get whip now for me. I needed to get whoops. Oh, I'm not mad at my mom's right I get it. But you know as a parent I was just I specially because my first to wil girls I never wanted him to have a memory of a man putting a hand on them and that starts with me now to challenge it at is but it becomes psychological warfare because when they messing up, you know there You need to have some lines of authority. So they learn you know, the rules in life, but then it's like okay, how do you because you certain instinctual feelings you have you know, so it's challenging its challenges constantly challenging that it you know, with the oldest. Like I said, it's like it's a whole new ballgame of Connection and all right, how do you because I can't just snatch you up and throw you in the back. You know, you got your own apartment your own car. So this is all right. How do we wait this out that yeah, but I'm still your father.	0.0

Yeah. Yeah, right then we will now move on we were of quell quickly talk about the fixtures upcoming as well. So obviously another draw continuing the unbeaten run in the Premier League and now it's a pretty busy this Member schedule so walls are play West Ham midweek, right and next week. She kicked ass in our final Europa League group game and then going into a busy Christmas Pippi period Spurs Norwich City Liverpool and then Watford in New Year as well. So pretty hefty one Lads. I mean in terms of the next as I two games West Ham and brighten four to six points reveal.	1.0
Yeah. No, I think it is worse. I think like the shooting feels worse like coming from like on client to 64. I think you can it's a noticeable different if you play a lot on client, but yeah in terms of movement stuff, I think it's like so my new and I don't think and maybe this is like a contrarian view. I don't think the right move is to move everything to 128 take like, I don't think that's smart. I think it's like right there.	0.0
Cough.	1.0
It's all very similar. But the difference is you guys have Specialists. Sorry, there's a department specifically working or H sort of thing that we do so you have salvaged and repair unit that works with the tools and uses the helmets. Then you have an underwater bomb disposal unit. Then you have the Tactical operations team. Then you have the land-based EOD whereas we don't have as much as many people as you and so the current starters we have to do all of that. So it's an interesting but it's hard to remember a lot of stuff. So it was really cool to just come out and meet with everyone and I made lifelong friends from that trip. Any one of those guys is my best friend to this day and the water spins the opposite way, correct? Yeah, exactly. You know, I kind of fell in love with it and America has this really romantic sort of feel for Australians because we all grow up watching. It on TV and in the movies, and and so when I got the opportunity to come out here all a jumped on it and I love living out this see that's how we feel about our show you is that we have very romanticized absolutely.	1.0

I'm pretty sure this is going to go to the Silver Screen. But again, a lot of these ball picks up going to like lifetime it BTW and stuff. So I'll hope that they you know end up giving it more Justice and put it on the movie theater. So, you know, we'll see how this one goes second bit. Is Wu-Tang they're going back on tour. This is going to be a majority worldwide tour. Obviously, they're going to be in the States but the majority of the legs of the tour or going to be overseas. They are going on tour with Public Enemy and they lost soul and this is going to be called the gods of wrapped or and it starts actually on the first weld it with this is when it did let's give me this one when to take it when I say, oh, I'm sorry, but the actual leg the first leg starts in London on May the 10th, but when they come back to the States, they're going to be in flocks area and going to be in Chicago on June 1st, and then they're going to be in Cleveland Simpsonville, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Asheville Boston on Cassville. I think that's in Connecticut and Landing City Seattle Mountain View, California, Wichita, Kansas Council Bluffs, Iowa, I think and me and hapless, Minnesota on August 2nd. What to end the tour now I know that we did talk about will take last album, which we didn't think was very good. But I'm more than certain expenses just going on tour Public Enemy. They'll also they're going to be doing a lot of old stuff like that's that's just what it is, especially for the we talked about this before as well how a lot of a lot of people overseas like that's where they get their money and if you can still go overseas and still perform all your old hits, then you're still popping and people overseas love love artist over here and they love all of Their old stuff that they that they came out with over a year. So how you feel about this tour with this be something that you will be slightly interested in since they're coming to school.	1.0
Jillian is in though. She's not putting a dollar figure on it quite yet. Here's James. I think you're excellent. And you're in a right progression in your career. One weakness. I see with you is that you haven't sold a business nor has anyone on your team. So it's very important almost as important as the other skills combined and so you don't have that and that's that's a significant weakness, but you do I do and so I I would be willing to fill up this bridge by the way. I'm not a venture firm. This is with me with skin in the game. I'd be willing to fill up your round which I think you said this about this about a hundred or hundred fifty left.

Yeah, and I mean I see I've just just personally that's what my father-in-law's who is this is a working class person. So it's just been work out all of his life and he has been able to in France in the 1970s. He is called a how's it going with his family to application? I mean they've been always very disciplined and so on but he could afford all these things could send their children to school could send them to diverse universe. He was paying for all of this. I mean how many Working Class People can do this today? It's just I mean you to be top notch in your activity extremely well paid is a working class object group occupation order to do this. So most people cannot and he was kind of average at the time. So I think if you look at these things even on an anecdotal basis and see what's what are the living conditions real terms. I would how did people live what did they consume? What kind of food they bring on the table? Where did they travel and so on in light of this? I mean clearly they are many signs of impoverishment and on top of this comes of course, I mean we have both right. I think we have Capital destruction. So there is an aggregate impoverishment at the same time. We have this redistribution. So they're out of the fewer resources in comparison to whatever 20 30 years ago. It's a greater chant goes to their people are very well connected and So the other classes and that is of course, that's that's explosive for society.	0.0

So the last thing we'll do is we're going to go into some reader mail. Okay, first up we have Travis. Hey guys and girl with the release of Apex Legends with with the release of Apex. Legends came the inspiration to replay Titanfall 2 campaign upon completion of the campaign. I noticed something pretty interesting in the final mission. There is a huge reference towards Apex Legends. I was dumbfounded the Bounty Hunter that catches you in Titanfall 2 campaign mentions Apex Legends and gives you a and Apex card as a sort of invite to the game pretty cool. This could also eat or this could also even have some relevance on future characters in Apex. Maybe. Could you possibly be Pilot Jack Cooper in Apex or even the Bounty Hunter mercenary General martyr. What are ya'lls thoughts? I mean, we talked a little bit about Titanfall. So I felt like that was a perfect email to bring up. I mean, I honestly did not know that I full disclosure. I'm sorry. I'd actually didn't get all the way through the Titanfall campaign or whatever so I didn't see this but Travis I didn't finish it. It's oh, yeah, I know. II I've always wanted to and it was just one of those things like I think when I happened to pick it up I have to pick it up on a little bit of a sale or something. I didn't pick it up on day one, but I absolutely love the multiplayer and when I play a game and I really really like the multiplayer. It's kind of hard to bring myself to to play the campaign the campaign like really really good example is like a battlefield one. I really like Battlefield ones multiplayer, but the second I went into Campaign and I started to die. I try throwing down a med pack and I'm like, oh, that's right. I can't do that. Yeah, so there was just so many moments like that. I just couldn't get over it.	0.0

Challenger maybe, but Naomi had to do it and you wouldn't think Naomi is like this like top Valentina is the girl who does nothing at the school project will put her name on them. So I was like perfectly. I just I felt like she when she was talking to both of them. I felt like in her head. She I mean we all know she lives in her own world, but I feel like she thought they're not going to send me home because of her relationship with them and because In her head she deserves to be in the finale that being said anybody, you know, it's like you can say that but then you can't say that Latrice can't think the same thing because that was the issue before was that Latrice is like why I've been around a long time. I deserve to be here. I shouldn't have gone home. Then you can't be mad. You didn't mean does that make sense? Well, thank you can't be mad at me choose for saying it and then B and then be okay with Valentina going we are well I shouldn't be because I'm fabulous well. Latrice is fabulous. I'm sorry Sheila made herself. I think yeah, absolutely. She said absolutely I didn't do anything. Yeah, we'll go. Well and even when she says give me a reason to keep you. She just said do what you think is best and I think that in when I heard that I went she thinks you're not going to send her home. So she's just telling you to do what you need is a great social player because she said yourself a few times. Yeah, but you know, the third time really wasn't her child in her favor.

It's actually like deals just as good as neikei even better. So so that's a little bit of a problem because it's like $1,000 less. Yeah. I don't know what you do. It's good. Isn't it?

So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right.

We actually played our church so it works out but like I just feel like when It's like almost like I'm praying to feel like just I'm trying to release it when I know that it's like I can feel it in my chest. Like I just sing really loud. Which yeah, it's I don't know. It's a whole article it is like the other day. I was listening to Skillet, which if you don't know who Skillet is there like a heavy metal Christian rock band, which you would never know there were heavy metal Christian rock, but you should listen if you'd have time go listen to Stars which is so good. It's like I was for the day I was driving to the mall before a thing that had to go to I'm just like I'm like, okay. Well, that's a fail because I'm like losing my makeup. You're not gonna do all this again. Yeah, but like, I don't know for me singing just like it's almost like it's like releasing from me to like just at least calm down and it's my way of prey like like an open loudmouth prayer of like, okay. I'm here. I just need some help. Yeah. Well, I realized that that that is helpful. I also understand that having a counselor or a doctor or those also like you have to have all of those components I think you yeah. To really make you feel like you can help help it kind of get under control. That's yeah, at least that's what works for me. I've probably become more spiritual and that respect and like in the last probably two years. It's like I would have never thought to like jump right into that be like, yeah. Okay, that's not that's not like I grew up in a church-going family. But like I haven't really like connected to that until like recently which is kind of cool. But yeah makes me feel better.	1.0

Well, yeah then thank you for that. I you know, I'm I don't know how to respond to that. I appreciate that more than you know, don't get me wrong. I have my share of demons. My closet as well and there are people who know that I can I'm a big believer in in sharing your feelings regardless of what because that's how people get to know you. So yes, I try to be the kindest person possible and I hope that I am especially with students. I always am but let's be honest. We all have our moments right? I definitely want to wear my heart on my sleeve. That's why I have a tattoo of a heart stone on my wrist because I do but no, I really appreciate that more than you know, and and I can't take total credit for For my I guess philosophy or attitude or just believe on this subject it stemmed from well. First of all, my upbringing I was raised by the best parents in the world and completely always surrounded by Family transition that to school. I had some of the best teachers in the world. I was lucky enough to go to a very very small school. So everybody knew everybody, you know your teachers Knew by first middle and last name then your family. I was raised in a kind World, which I think a lot of people our age were and unfortunately, Times have changed like you said times are changing and times are changing in and I'm a big believer that no one was was inherently born as an unkind human being it's something you're taught. It's something that you've experienced. It's what you were surrounded by on a daily basis and my goal. Our goal is to Decatur's should be to reverse that statistics and get it back to you know, I don't know just get the world to be one happy place. I know that sounds so cliche and and cool, but Then moving forward I guess to go back into my philosophy. And reason for this stemmed from a woman who was my mentor teacher and I know I've told this story before on multiple platforms and media devices and want to hear it again.	1.0
I was I was shopping like a normal person, but you know, well, yeah me and Ryan well at the time of looking at a hat. like we all like Honestly our realize like I didn't really look at him closely my time.

Teachers as well, but I felt like Allstate had the best set of features. So I was like, yeah was he is he kind of cheating on this? Like I still thought that he had the best the best album out of the three, but the features like if you're looking at it from that perspective that the county is cheating like because it's like damn can you do any dope song by yourself, but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because I still enjoy like the majority of the songs on here.	0.0

Welcome to the construction Brothers podcast. I'm your host Tyler Campbell and with me like he is every week giving me a smirk my brother Eddie Campbell. That was just a smile. That was a smirk its mark means I'm up to something. Well, we got an awesome show for you. Today. We're going to be talking to mr. Tyler / a of f of my Consultants about Mega projects. We were really excited to get to that here. In a moment, but first things first, I'm like to bring something to your attention. No, no, no don't don't don't so it's been cold here in Middle, Georgia. Eddie of you. Have you noticed that it's been a little bit cold? Yeah, give the fact it was like 80 directly before the 29. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed Yeah, so in case you guys don't know we live in Middle, Georgia Middle, Georgia can't make up its mind on whether so we'll go from 80 degrees one day and 30 the next it will just drop overnight. It's absolutely insane. Yeah, actually did that last week it literally did so but here's the thing Florida also got smacked with this little cold front to and there was a little news article that HuffPost put up that I was Giggling at earlier. So some things are falling out of trees and they're not the Coconuts. Are they snakes? They're not snakes. I was hoping there was no not snakes. Again. We passed on that no coconuts and no snakes. They're not monkeys. What are they? So the National Weather Service Office in Miami tweeted don't be surprised. If you see iguanas falling from the trees tonight as lows drop. Up into the 30s and 40s, brr. Yeah, especially if you're an iguana, so it's something that they don't usually talk about and I've heard of this before whenever it gets really cold down in Florida iguanas start falling from the trees because they just they can't handle it. They're not dead. They're just Frozen. Well, they're cold-blooded. Yeah. Yeah, so cold weather is kind of tough on something like that counting that subsists because of the Sun and its heat when that goes away has a hard time. It's true. It's true, especially when in trees I'm going to read on a little bit so iguanas aren't dangerous or aggressive to humans, but the damage seawalls sidewalks and Landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. Actually. I didn't know that did you know that a Guam has dug tunnels? No. That's kind of terrifying that's news to me. It's like a dinosaur digging a tunnel a mini dinosaurs a micro dinosaur building a tunnel it is I wonder if elon's going to like get 200,000 iguanas and like try to get them to dig tunnels under Ela or so. That's how he's gonna get us how he's gonna do it. He's not actually going to use a machine. He's just going to get all of the iguana's he's got a tiny Army of iguanas. To dig his tunnel under Los Angeles. I mean the man's genius secret. That's the secret. What you do is you have to harness them together. So you get to Belt any straps groups of ten together and then he makes this massive circle of iguanas that he just sets underground and they start chopping away does the circle spin I think so like a carousel. Yeah. It's like a vertical Carousel with iguanas. Yeah. He leads them. Buying by using electric heaters. So he basically entices them with a heat source. And so they move towards the heat source. It's science everybody history. It's mr. Tyler Perez going to be proud of this intro I can hear now. Hey, man, you should have done your research before getting interviewed by us. You didn't know you didn't know. I don't know nothing about nothing. But that intro man. We are smart around here at school this week. I would like to introduce a new segment and we're going to call that segment. Shower thoughts buckle up. For those of you that don't know there is a subreddit called our shower thoughts on it. You can scroll through and a lot of people just post their post their shower thoughts on there. And a lot of these are are quite interesting. So I kind of wanted to take some time today and read them to you and I figured we'd all have a nice little chuckle about this and or Break our brains a little bit just because of how awesome these are they deep. Some of them is this like deep thoughts. Let me give you the let me give you the first one on my list. Okay, if your thumb is chopped off you lose your middle finger. Yeah. Okay, I can see how this would be a mind-blowing thing. More people have stood on the moon then on your desk. That's not true. Is it not know how is it not true because more people have stood on my desk. No, it's not. How do you know who stood on your desk? Why are you standing on your desk for what have you stood on your desk? I've never stood on my desk. So how can you make this argument? Because somebody else has who small people though? We're not going there. Why can't I talk about my kids on the show man? I'm gonna he's not. Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, I thought you were going another way with that. But yeah, okay fine. No Tyler. I was not and I would like you to go read the employment posters now because spiders mold every time you think you see a dead spider you might be looking at the skin of a live spider that is now larger than it was before. I did not need to hear that today. No, I know you love spiders. Yeah - there are gallons of saliva traveling through the postal system at any given moment. I have a question. What do you like licking stamps and envelopes? Sometimes they had I don't know how you feel man, really mixed emotions. Yeah, really mixed emotions. Some of them actually taste. Okay, if you think about it, it's kind of got a muted taste. It's not anything earth-shattering. It's not like Gordon Ramsay himself cooked something and slathered like some broth on the outside of the envelope for you to lick. Okay, let me bring this full circle. Okay. Is there a market for envelopes that taste good? I think there is actually there are envelopes out there that tastes good are there. Yeah, I think there's there's why with me yeah, this is too obvious. Yeah. Like popcorn slathered in butter. That's terrible. Here's one for you. All numbers are closer to 0 than they are to Infinity. I just watch Teddy's head explode. Okay. All right here. Oh, okay. Now here's one dentist study the dangers of plaque in order to receive a plaque that says they can remove your plaque. That's a lot of levels of plaque it is it's like plaque exception. How do you feel about flying? I think that it's a good idea. And most of the time I leave it at that I always bleed every time I floss then the lady over at the dentist's office is always like this because you don't floss and I'm like, but I bleed when I flies I'm like so you're telling me that I would build calluses between my teeth and my teeth holes that would it would prevent the bleeding. And your and your teeth Caverns dude. I I I call Shenanigans. I think big floss is out to get us probably is yeah. Yeah. No, this is all just a racket and all the Mr. In it. They're out there trying to sell their Wares trying to sell us string string with mint flavoring on it in some cases. You know what all this time. They could be tied in with the envelopes to the the people that make the tasty envelopes. Because you think about it. It's the same technology. You're applying Taste of paper, you know, like or like string or like textiles you haven't lived though until you got that piece of popcorn stuck in your teeth in the floss comes in for the rescue and saves the day I got used to do that. No, that's your penalty for eating popcorn. I refuse to use no, I will not use floss to dislodge a popcorn brightest popcorn have to have any kind of punitive value attached to it because Because when it comes out you can eat. So you're saving it for later? Yeah gives you it gives you something to do. What do you think of beards for? Well, why do you think I have a beard to save it for later? Obviously. It's crumb catcher. That's what it is. It's your peanut butter and jelly for lunch. By the way, I didn't have peanut butter and jelly belly. Well that's even scarier than what's in my beard. All right. Well, let's let's move this thing along. Let's talk about Tyler / a so he came in and he wanted to discuss mega-projects FMI is really huge in finding reports and collecting information and spreading that out to people Eddie. I feel like this was more Show then mine listening back to it because you had you just nerded out on a lot of these factoids. This is just right in your veins. So I think I think we should just call this one the Eddie show. Haha. Yeah now I still construction Brothers man. No, no, it's the Eddie show. Okay. Yeah, but I think I said like two words and you hear a chuckle from me. All right, that's it. Everybody comment if you like that format and everybody comment if you miss me. Mom that's that's shit. I'm looking at you that's dangerous man. He had me nerding out because I'm I'm curious about what's going on in construction. Mmm, and he's got he's got research to back up the things that he's saying. Yeah, and so when he's coming at us talking about mega-projects talking about market trends talking about what's going on with Our labor shortages, he has resources and knowledge to back that up. And I think that there is going to be a lot of value to this show. Mmm. Maybe not just may not be for absolutely everyone. I think it's going to be intriguing for most. Yeah, and there's a lot of content here that I feel like just great content, but I do see people that are on the front end of construction trying to decide what they're doing. With projects and how they're how they're going about business right here in a lot of value here. One of the things that really stuck out to me back to the labor shortage. He was saying that we lost a lot of that labor back in O8 during the crash. Yeah, they left and they just never came together came back. And so that is something that we're facing now and something that gets a code often is we need labor. I don't know how many times I've read articles in the recent past that say, I mean, Can too are you a human being do you have a pulse? And those are your requirements? Do you know how to get out of bed? Like we're that starved for Laborers. I'm only being a little silly. Yeah, like I have read articles that are really not far off at in construction Publications. And so yeah, I mean talking about that the Scout of be something of interest to people listening if you're in the construction industry and you have to Source labor, I know that's something We experienced here. Yeah, how do we find talented people get them here retain them train them the way we do things and then leave and effective team. Even if you're a labor in you know in the workforce right now, this could be encouraging to you, you know, and maybe you could start looking at things that you do in a different way that hey maybe I can leverage this. Maybe I can leverage these skills that I have to build up a business, too. Fit in to that that missing piece in our industry. Maybe you can digital. Yeah, maybe you can just realize that you are a valuable part of the industry. You are. Yeah and that your commodity it's hard work, but we appreciate everybody out there doing that every single day. Yeah stay at it. Yeah. All right guys, well, we're going to go ahead and move along and we're going to get into our episode with Tyler Gray. All right, Tyler. Thanks for joining us today.	1.0

And if someone's meant to encounter God in a specific way that will be taken care of with or without you harping on the person and actually it's probably less likely to happen if you are harping on the person so just like it's like they could go and they could be showing so much of like, what is it like what day want to like show the person of like if they say that they have God inside of them. It's like are they really showing that because right, you know, a lot of the Christians, you know, people want nothing to do with them because they're so mean and so it's like why would we want your God if like this is what he looks like in my core. I think I fundamentally think we as Humanity are intrinsically good and and I know that like a lot of Christian teaching is that like we're intrinsically evil, but I guess I was just kind of encourage people to step away from I'm like necessarily putting that on all of humanity. Like I don't know. I'm just so positive and I'm so optimistic and like I know there are so many bad things in this world, but I feel like they're always met with like an overwhelming amount of love and support that shows like the goodness of humanity. Like for example, the Orlando nightclub shooting that happened, you know, that was like horrible, but after that Like there were so many people lined up to donate blood and I think just like recognizing that that we are like capable of doing so much good and and focusing on that and then also recognizing that people are so much more than a label like there's so much more than a single word or a single defining term and if we can accept people and like truly accept them. For who they are and not try to change them. I think will realize that it's okay to disagree because those labels don't Define who a person is like I don't Define you by your Christian faith, like you're someone who is fighting for Change and promoting love and acceptance and kindness and equality and those are things that I agree with so if we can focus on what we have in common instead of what divides us, I think, you know, we can you know, Live in a much better world just recognize that the people like your enough like your enough just being you. I don't know like I just feel like like it's in us like we're just good. Well, thank you so much for this conversation. It was awesome.	1.0

I'm like you got first of all last night I did that we were moved 47 times and we ended up in a table in the corner and there was no other tables there and I was just showing you and JJ I wasn't going to solve draw because he does not want to see a naked woman. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, but like that's different like you guys have you guys you have to see this? This like not gonna send it to like most people don't deserve my mood. Mmm, but like you do thank you so much. You're welcome. You deserve my nude shade on you most of the time if I do take one it gets right to you same it's like I'm going to save this. Also. I'm going to send it to you and no one else exactly because I literally like Women bringing up women is like the best thing so when you're like girl, yes, you look amazing. Best feeling, you know, I like read a meme that said something like it's not a like, I'm bad at this Dad. I know you guys said something along the lines of like you don't have to like beat somebody you're in different races like the concept of kind of like you don't have to bring someone else down just to like succeed and I think that like, We need to continue that like culture around like bring other women up. Don't tear them down. Like we have enough people trying to like pull us back and we need to like help push each other forward absolutely to help each other find our good angles in life and in nudes facts. I love it. I got to be able to get it to you. Thank you so much. I strive to like bring that out in people. I think so if there's ever photos of me on the internet, I'm gonna blame you.	1.0
