3	So this week on the podcast we are going to be diving into everyone's favorite friend anxiety and Jen and I are going to be sharing our story and what things that we have found help us to decrease our anxiety and what things kind of trigger our anxiety and let's do this together. And we are going to talk about everyone's favorite topic shopping.	1.0
1	No manicures massages yelling at your husband know that that actually that actually leads to this or right I'm tributes that too.	-1.0
3	So we're going to talk about anxiety. So part of this podcast is really we really want to kind of get down into the nitty-gritty of all the things and Is just kind of a constant part of my life. So me too. We were like, you know what? I'm sure other people struggle with this too. And so let's talk about it.	1.0
1	Let's bring it out there and well, I'm I'm really guilty of like sharing memes all in like inspirational quotes and things like that on Instagram all the time talking about you anxiety and self-care and you know how you can manage it and sure that sounds nice and fluffy, but not all the time. Can we manage it with memes and coffee? And taking a bubble bath. So right which I mean it all helps but yeah, sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah, we'll see so so I know Audrey and I have spoken obviously beforehand about our previous experiences with anxiety and we have both in in overtime bin both diagnosed with a clinically diagnosed with anxiety. So I thought what we do first is kind of tell our like a briefly tell our story about how the It impacted us and then kind of what we're doing with it now and then maybe talk about some ideas of how we can other than a bubble bath how we can kind of help to relieve some of that anxiety when we're having those stressful days. Yeah, you wanna go first.	1.0
3	Yeah, I'll go first. So I think anyone who probably knows me since I was a kid knows that Audrey was that anxiety girl the worrier and I grew up in the church and so a big Big part of my upbringing was you know, pray about it and you know, don't worry don't be anxious and have faith and all of that stuff is fantastic and amazing and it is helpful. But sometimes if you have a sinus infection or you have the flu you go get medicine to help you with that or you go see a doctor and so my anxiety kind of got to a point where it was really hard to even function where it was just like okay something is not right here. And so I would say probably probably in college is kind of when I finally was like, all right, this is not this is not normal like normal people don't get this worried to the point of you know, you can't even do new things or you can't function in life. And so I started first seeing a counselor and she was really really helpful. I think one thing about a counselor is they're awesome. But sometimes we kind of view them as like a Next it's like okay, I'm gonna fix it. But just like a car you don't get your oil changed once and then drive the car for 10 more years sure. So I think with anxiety different things in your life can kind of happen and it rears its ugly head. And so I think it's important to kind of know yourself and know what your triggers are and and acknowledge them and then not wait until things get really really bad before you try to get. Because it's just going to be that much harder to dig kind of dig out of it. Yeah, for sure. Yep.	-1.0
1	Awesome. Awesome, but good story.	1.0
3	Yeah, so glad you have anxiety.	1.0
1	I know it's a lot but but you know what? It's so common now, it's one of those like, oh, I have anxiety who have anxiety. I have depression. You have depression who like right is it is it you have a mental illness and I really love just that there is such a spotlight on it right now. I mean, I I have always gosh my parents got Divorced when I was we moved here to st. Louis when I was in third grade my parents got divorced when I was in fourth grade and that was a pretty ugly divorce. And so because of that my parents had put me in counseling with my brother. So I was used to that concept and then I went through high school and my dad was diagnosed with ALS and that just whole concept of watching my dad died for 18 years that was a lot but in the middle of that I kind of I was always the kid who had To do all the things I mean the old the oldest so I always felt the need to always be have be perfect and get good grades and Achieve and do all the great things - Sports because I suck at Sports and basically I went to college had a awful breakup with a boyfriend and I just kind of went off the deep end. I was I would say I can't quite remember two years of my life and rightfully so and that's that. My twin just the combination of my dad and that that break up like we were going to get married. It was like a whole thing. Like we were we were there and going I switched schools and like it just all kind of like whoo One Time Hit me and at that point my parents were like, okay, it's time like we need to talk to somebody you need to go see somebody and I started seeing a therapist and a weekly basis and I was diagnosed with anxiety PTSD from my parents divorced. From fourth grade which always seems kind of strange but I guess yeah, they're the experts there and it was recording of my Apple watch was recording that and so I started seeing by somebody and we talked and I we did we I went every week and like they would give me things to work on or things so and I was medicated at that point. I think I was on two different medications and I felt good and I felt like I was starting to like get the tools that Did to like handle my situation and and then kind of calm myself down when I was, you know, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They actually were able to help me give me extra time for taking tests and things like that at school because I would just get so overwhelmed that I could like put I wouldn't even take the test. I would just sit there and like fries. Yeah, which then made my last two years of college extremely difficult, right? And but then it was one of those really crazy things that I met my husband. Well, it was my seen my super senior year of Cool, super super semester my life physical senior plus like the extra semester and I met Jeff and it was one of those things that like, I don't know if it was just our yin and yang - of our personalities. He was able to just come in and be a really great kind of source of balance and understanding for me and slowly over that first year of us dating. I wean myself off of all of the medication that I had been on now people would be like, oh that's probably not the best idea but for He understood like where I was coming from and he knew my whole background and he was like he was in favor. Whatever I needed to do. Yeah, but he definitely wanted to make sure that one he could be as part of a because he could be in our relationship and so I have not been on medication since then but up until now I have recently started well in the last year or so. I started going back to a therapist just with Hattie going back to school and trying to figure out life and what's next for me in terms. Of the crazy world and just my role as a blogger and an influencer how that's changed. I get a lot of anxiety from just being a blogger. Yeah. So being on Instagram all the time feeling like you always have to be on and feeling exhausting for an extroverted interview. Yes. So exhausted. I'm feeling like you always have to have something fresh and new and that are going to get people excited to see what you're doing that day. That's A lot and then the flip side of that is if you would if you think you post something that's so you think you work so hard you did so great and then it tanks and it's like right. Well, you know, maybe I'm a failure or what's going on and then then there's days where like or I get a comments or I get like a series of things happen. I'm also really bad about like collecting all of my feelings and then exploding. Yeah. So that's also a whole nother conversation for another day, but it's I could basically like have a comment that will trigger me and then I Disappear for like a couple of days and and I just don't want to deal with like the world. But here I am. I've selected a profession that makes me forward facing to the world, but I'm human so it's kind of hard like it's it's a lot. So yeah, so I mean I find it helpful to you go to a therapist now I do so, but I feel like sometimes I find it helpful like we just sometimes we have nothing to talk about and like and those are the days I don't you. I have the same situation you go in and having nothing to talk about and then like some ugly yucky stuff. Just yeah boils up from the bottom and you're like where did that come from? So like did not play in that but here we are.	-1.0
3	Yeah, so and I think you and I are like, I'm the oldest child too and my brothers eight years younger than me. So I was kind of an only child for quite a while to and I also combat it anxiety by doing things and over functioning and that's kind of when I need to get better about realizing this but when I get to the point where I'm like doing all the things and you know, working and working out and planning parties and like doing doing doing doing doing it's like it's only a matter of time before I'm gonna like Crash and Burn and are your are you me?	-1.0
1	This is I know yeah.	1.0
3	Well, yeah and it's I was trying to explain this to my husband a little bit because he he's German he comes from a very like we don't talk about her feelings kind of family. And so For him anxiety is its he doesn't really understand kind of how it is. And it's like it's almost like you have like a trillion things just coming at you all the time all the time all the time and you have to figure out which ones are like real and which ones are trying to trick you and especially when you throw in like a little bit of like depression your brain is like go go go go go go go, but then the depression is like Buddha can't	-1.0
1	That sounds great because I'm worthless anyways, and I don't have any purpose anyways, and yes, and I think one of the things I learned from going to therapy was that I'm really good at playing at a situation that's occurred. And then I try to like then I replay that story over and over and over in my head of well, why did they say it that way or how did what did I do wrong? And it's always what did I do wrong? And then I'm basically become Steven Spielberg and I've like made all these movies in my head of how they should have gone or could have gone. And I've been like look down. Like I've just spent two hours consumed by a probably that something that's not even real that nobody cares about. Yeah. It's all in your head and it just spins and Spins and Spins and it's like well get out of your head and like go for a walk or something right and I think for me to like I'm	-1.0
3	I'm naturally very like caring and thoughtful and I want to be there for other people and this year has been really hard for my family and a lot of people around my family. We've had unexpected deaths and just sickness and just so many cancer and things where it's like, I wouldn't my dad called and said, you know, Mom has to start treatment. I kind of freaked out for about 30 seconds and then I was like, it's okay. I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna drive heard all the appointments. I'm going to make dinner every time and I'm gonna learn how to crochet and I'm going to make her head Cinema and it was like I was going to fix it by doing doing doing doing and then I kind of went through a phase where I was like crap. I can't fix any of this no matter what you do and I think that's where anxiety gets tricky for people like us it's because it's like you can't fix it. Like when your dad was going through that there's there's nothing you can do and feeling powerless hmm to somebody like us who is very Very successful at fixing things. Yeah, it's it's hard because then you have to just be yeah and being is hard hard so hard.	1.0
1	It's like I don't I have like two two speeds. I'm like fully on or fully like out of gas. There's just like no like hey Jen's gonna like do a couple of things today and like feel like she's accomplished something. No, it's like Full Throttle or yeah, so well, and I don't know if you feel the same. But like I have so much anxiety for my children or child. So like I come I like pick heading up a school and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna interrogate her. Okay. Well Jeff for lunch, which is the Hoosier. Who'd you bring with like all the things. Did you make a friend today? Are you kind it's like I'm like sitting there all day stressing out as is my child making good choices and it's like real and I know she is because we raised her to like do those types of things are or it's like and it's probably because I've never had lots of great like strong female friends in my life, like I'll They kind of bounce around which is fine. So I always ask Daddy. Like do you have a friend like do you like are you you know, like tell me tell me who you're playing with like do we want to play date? Do we want to get? Yeah, I'm psycho. Like that's just one of the comes down to but I want her to have a little friend so bad which then is interesting because I was that y'all know. I love me in a granny a gram. Yeah, but my Enneagram for said like my Enneagram Force has that I love dogs. So I was like that fun. Yeah the funny when you showed me the other day it said that I love having like One person that I can always go to and I feel like I'm now projecting my Enneagram needs onto my jacket. Yeah, which I've learned in Enneagram our small group that you can't do that. Yeah, your child is not having any a gram yet. But you can't you can't do that diagnose them or us. Yes. Yes. Assuming she's a fork. She's not a for she's definitely more like a one like her. I don't like her dad. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Yeah anywhere totally off topic there. But but yeah, it's hard because it's like I stress about all day. I'm like, okay. All right like it. Am I gonna get a phone call? Am I gonna get like a note home from school? Like what are we doing here? And we were when we were having sensory issues are we like? Is there something truly wrong with her than the did I do something wrong that I raised her wrong. Did I like did I feed her something weird at a wrong time in life where like I've done this to her. Yeah. Whoo. Yeah. This is why I only have one child because you know, I have so much gray hair. It's not even funny. Well right before we started recording.	-1.0
3	I got a call about my son's speech. Meaning and how they're like, well we can see and go through this process and it didn't like you want them to be good kids and you want them to be healthy and but yeah, then what if something is not quite right? How do you fix it? And I think the other thing with anxiety that I've kind of noticed just from other people in my life is I don't know exactly how to say it but like a lot of times people are anxious because they don't have a job. Job, or they don't have money, but you can't like you need resources and you need help but it takes money to have those resources. I know and so like just yesterday. So my sons having a really hard time at drop off still and it's it's a lot and so I contacted this place and they're like, oh we're out of network. It's going to be like three hundred fifty dollars for the screening and you know, so it's like, okay. I'm trying to deal with this thing. I'm trying to You know, I'm trying to do the right things, but I can't spend $500 on a problem that lasts 5 minutes in the morning, you know, so I think that's the other thing that's tricky about mental health is that first of all, you have to want to get help because I don't know how many people I've tried to help and if they don't want to get better sure they can't they're never going to get better. But even people that do want help sometimes it's it's hard financially to to get the help that you need.	-1.0
1	I totally get that and I think for me it's like when I've tried to help people. I've I've helped them while I'm like saying. Yes, you probably need to go talk to somebody. That's great. The other things that I've done is the first thing I've now kind of trained myself to do is when I'm starting to feel funky, which is this is weird. I'm going to say it. Oh I sit in my car and I listen to loud Christian music which yeah in the past.	1.0
3	And this would not be like anything close to me to like I yeah, like I'd like to try her face. She's like, oh my God, I'm like, oh, yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah. I've never like I always used to make fun of my mom when we were younger because she used to listen to like, what's the joy of em. Oh, yeah. I don't listen to the radio radio, but I listened to XM radio and so they have a channel called the message. And so which happens that a lot of the music that they play on the message. We actually played our church so it works out but like I just feel like when It's like almost like I'm praying to feel like just I'm trying to release it when I know that it's like I can feel it in my chest. Like I just sing really loud. Which yeah, it's I don't know. It's a whole article it is like the other day. I was listening to Skillet, which if you don't know who Skillet is there like a heavy metal Christian rock band, which you would never know there were heavy metal Christian rock, but you should listen if you'd have time go listen to Stars which is so good. It's like I was for the day I was driving to the mall before a thing that had to go to I'm just like I'm like, okay. Well, that's a fail because I'm like losing my makeup. You're not gonna do all this again. Yeah, but like, I don't know for me singing just like it's almost like it's like releasing from me to like just at least calm down and it's my way of prey like like an open loudmouth prayer of like, okay. I'm here. I just need some help. Yeah. Well, I realized that that that is helpful. I also understand that having a counselor or a doctor or those also like you have to have all of those components I think you yeah. To really make you feel like you can help help it kind of get under control. That's yeah, at least that's what works for me. I've probably become more spiritual and that respect and like in the last probably two years. It's like I would have never thought to like jump right into that be like, yeah. Okay, that's not that's not like I grew up in a church-going family. But like I haven't really like connected to that until like recently which is kind of cool. But yeah makes me feel better.	1.0
3	So anything kind of what you're saying to you like if you're Having you know a lot of anxiety and you're just not feeling great. I kind of like to say you have to give yourself a fighting chance. So I mean I noticed when I'm eating really poorly and I'm not working out and I'm just like I guess what's one more pint of ice cream and that's me and hurt me and Fountain Coke. Yeah, like you just you just feel like gross and I think I kind of made the decision last week and then of course, I got my wisdom teeth out this week. So I've kind of been knocked down but um, I'm Like you know what? Okay, I I'm probably never going to be the same size. I was before I had kids and that's fine. And but I need to give myself the best chance that I can so I'm going to drink water. I'm going to exercise even if like 30 minutes. And so last year I did an Ironman Triathlon, which released 1.2 miles Swim 56-mile Bike and then a half marathon. So for me to sit here and go. Oh, I'm going to walk for 30 minutes. It's like kind of like a In the face to myself because it's like are you kidding me right now? Like you just did this a tower of n but that's what I can do right now. And so that's what I'm going to do. And those little habits are going to build on top of each other and then you're going to get stronger and grow and yeah, and so I think part of it too is you have to give yourself the best possible shot that you can but that kind of brings up like self-sabotage. I know I do that. I'm so good at that where it's like, you know, I'll do a way. Weight loss challenge or something and I'll get so close, but I'm like, I'm not going to make it so I'm just gonna gain ten pounds anyways, and like why do I do that?	1.0
1	That was me. So yesterday I had to go I went to go get a chemical peel and the gal that that was there. She's like, oh I saw that you were going to do hard 75 did you do it and I'm like, I don't even try I like. I know I announced it and I was like, I'm gonna do this. I'm like gonna jump it and then what is it? Oh heart 75. Oh, it's awful don't do it, but it was basically two workouts a day. You had the E stick to eat like an eating diet of your choice. You had to read a 10-page to 10 pages of a self-help book a day and no alcohol for 75 days if you missed you had to start over so it's like a hardcore. Yeah, it's hardcore. It's like a yeah, it's super hardcore. So I was like am I like I was I was to the point I was like, okay. I'm in a good place. I think I can do this. I'd like to get kind of myself situated and it was like a gave me enough time that I would be done by Thanksgiving. Well, we're obviously Asleep, we're not there in five minutes.	1.0
3	You could do ya any five hours.	1.0
1	Yeah. So Jeff was like he came to me. He's like I saw that you posted this thing. I'm going to just take a step back and be like, I think you've been off more than you can chew and I think you're going to fail. Well, I appreciate my husband telling me like, I don't think this is a good idea then it was like he put the anxiety in my head of like, whoa, I think you're going to fail so like it was yeah, I'm setting myself up to fail, but I'm already being I'm already failing. So yeah, it was like, I think I'm not going to that. So anyway yesterday girls like Did you start at South both 75? I'm like no. No, didn't you enjoy it? She's like, okay. Just checking. I was just like and then she felt bad because like she thought I was like, right I was like no it's not a big deal. I was just it was it was like a like a gut decision that decision in the moment and I'm like, but that like for me and my lifestyle that I don't think that's a good fit, right? Yeah. I mean for me it's my goal is to get up and to go to the gym every day and feel good about you know, if I wake up and I don't feel right or like my Foot doesn't feel right. Like I don't go like I want to I do it feels good for me that day or if I need a rest day. It's great. And then yeah, um, that's what I do on that kind of a thing. Yes words are hard today. Apparently. What else do you do to help with your anxiety though?	1.0
3	I think. Every time I feel like just crazy crazy anxious, especially at night. It seems like it gets really bad at night. I'll watch an episode of like schitt's Creek or the office or something. That's like just I kind of know what's gonna happen. The characters are comforting to me and afterward it kind of like get your mind off of it and then afterwards it's like, all right, maybe this wasn't so crazy after all I also have the Calm app the daily corium. When I pay you for like the yearly thing or whatever and they have like a daily calm every day that's like 10 minutes and you do this calming thing and they have a bunch of different other like series on there too, like tackling anxiety and means meaningful eating mindful eating and just different things like that that it's so funny because you said like listening to Christian music and it feels very like woo or like just kind of corny or Shay. Yeah, well, you're just like okay, I do a meditation but that stuff really does help and it really makes a difference and I don't think there's anything wrong with doing it. I mean it but yeah, I've totally at first I was like this is so stupid. This is not going to help me but just like anything else if the more you do it the more it's gonna help you.	1.0
1	Well, I will tell them the story of me joining a second gym because because of that so I go to boot camp gym now. Love it, but for me, I am a burn time a bar lover and I kind of a behind my husband's back this week. And I joined about a local bar studio that Alpha also offers yoga and So currently I can't go see my therapist because she's got some stuff going on and we probably will be back for a month or two. So I'm in my mind. I was like, well, I'm going to try a new form of kind of self helping myself and I'm gonna do Yoga three times a week to see if I can kind of like Get Out of My Head learn how to like take deep breaths and really focus on the important things and just kind of have that me time. That's not not like going to the like another gem. This is like truly like a mind-body connection type of a thing. So report back on it. I'm going to go to my first yoga class next week I'm signed up to do it. So but it's like I think it's those things. It's like what can you do like, you also have to think outside yourself like, okay. Well, I've tried this. This doesn't work. Can I do something else do I think that will help and I so I'm going to try this for a few months and see if we'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I mean it's not going to hurt anything. So if anything it makes me feel stretchy, so right.	1.0
3	Yeah, and I think one thing you were saying to that or when you were talking that made me think of it is like eye for me like when I'm feeling anxious, I feel like everyone around me knows it. Oh for sure, but I'm really good at hiding it sometimes not necessarily around my kids or my husband. Because you day just kind of always get the worst of you unfortunately because they know you the best but you know, like tally your spouse or tell your kids like I've gotten into the Habit where I'll just tell the least like Haley some really struggling right now. Just give me a minute. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be short with you because I think like just saying it out loud is like this is a real thing. Like if I had a headache I would say hey, I have a headache or I sprained my ankle or whatever. It's like this is a real thing like this is Real condition that I have and you know, it's really flaring up today are probably having a rough day with it and just having somebody to that you can reach out to and sometimes like just laughing about how ridiculous anxiety is because it can get you like the other day Dex came home from school and he just I go are he just doesn't seem like himself. He just seems kind of sad and so are goes. Hey, buddy, so Dax is for okay, he goes hey, buddy. Do you have any pain in your back or your legs or your neck and that's was like I don't think so and here it looks at me and he goes well sometimes kids have cancer, you know, and that's how they find out about it and I was like what the hell if you can't say that to me and then I my brain like when you know, of course like, you know, I have a kid with cancer and how am I gonna deal with this and my mom has cancer but it's like I just had to kind of laugh and just shut it down and be like, nope. We're not gonna yeah. We're not gonna go there. Because it's not doing anything now, sometimes I've heard people what they'll say. Well what if this what if this and then they'll take it all the way? Yeah. Okay. Well, what if that does happen? Hmm. Well, okay. Well what you know and then just kind of played out and I mean even if the worst possible thing for to happen, there are people who they're resilient that you know, we will carry on and so I think it's hard at like it's easy right now to talk about all this because We're not in the middle of like an anxiety storm because with wait till this afternoon is this weekend, right?	-1.0
1	Something will pop up.	-1.0
3	Well just yesterday. I was telling my mom like, oh my gosh. I feel so much better my anxiety and then this morning I texted her and I was like, please erase everything. I just said yesterday because I'm feeling very anxious again. And I think for me to just like getting outside of your head talking to somebody else like just because anxiety story self-focused and just if you can like get outside of Yourself a little bit.	-1.0
1	What was it the lives that last weekend when I text you as like I'm going to quit the internet again today. Yeah, I don't do this anymore. Like I just want to know if you're like what happened? I'm like nothing happened. Yeah good the internet today. Like I just sometimes you're just like you kind of hit like this internal Tipping Point where nothing's really like doing anything but you're like, okay. Well the it's all creeping up again. And like I said the same thing I have I text you when I have a feeling weird and you're like, okay. Well, let me Knock you off the cliff and I'm like, yeah, and I have another good friend that lives in Ohio and I'll text her and I'm just like I don't know what's going on today. And so of course, it's nice to have other people who have the same anxiety situations that you do and so it's nice because like I might have a weird trigger point of like different things, but you also have different different areas that sets you off or I have another fun the same situation, but it's now we've kind of figured out how we can work together to kind of get you back into To a better space for that day, which is nice because then it's like okay. Well one you just saved me 50 bucks. We're going to therapist. Yeah, so it's somebody that truly cares about you and wants the best for you. So so it's like, okay. Are you having a better day now? Can I bring you some coffee?	1.0
3	Like what's yeah, I think to like just know that it's it's a legitimate real struggle and it's okay like you're not inconveniencing anyone you're not you know, like I think two people are like I'm so sorry. I'm a And it's like that's but that's part of you. That's all of you. You know that the good the bad the not so good and I think like if you can't take me with my the best of me you're at can't take the well, well they say with if you can't have the worst of you can have the best of me kind of right have you got it's all the all makes you part of it, you know, like for us to like some of that achieving that anxiety kind of helps us to achieve more and the you know me like worrying about people and caring that makes me really caring person. So there are aspects of anxiety that are good. I think it's just when it gets out of control and it becomes like a train that just won't stop and you can't make it.	1.0
1	Yes. Stop grunts. A moral of the story is I would think everybody has some form of anxiety and I think if you were saying no, you're kind of full of baloney because I think any denial Lingus you're doing here in denial is not everywhere in Egypt. Yeah Egypt. Yes. Anyway home and gen Wu I would say yeah, I mean On everybody is affected by it, you know obviously severity is going to change to you're not alone. I think that's the most important thing and three if you need help ask for help, like there are people there that to help you there are there are resources all over the place. I'm sure we could probably pull up a list of yeah, but put a list of resources together. That would be good for no notes who we show notes. We're also going to have some we have some in fact check.

1	Yes, but yes, it's I mean, I think it's a good thing to talk about it. And if you ever want to talk more we're always here to go to coffee have conversations, you know, text us. Yes, we we're not like we're not were like we're therapist or anything, but I think we've all been there and we understand it so which is a good thing.	1.0
3	Yep. Yeah, and I think asking for help is good. Start with your primary care and if they refer you to someone else, that's great, but don't don't feel ashamed and I think be your own Advocate. You know, like if you're taking walks in you're going to yoga and you're eating healthy and you're like really really really trying and it's like nothing is still working. It's okay to get help ya by someone who is professional not us. All right. Do you have a murky motherhood moment this week?	1.0
1	This week daylight savings has been kicking our butts. So we have had a lot of just morning meltdowns this week of really like we had I don't know if Elise was ever like this but we have had he doesn't like to wear socks because I don't like to wear socks. Yeah, it's a sensory thing, but I also don't like to wear socks and I don't I don't I don't promote socks in the summer and she always wears like natives usually don't wear socks because they're perforated and my mom gets so mad at me because she thinks that their room Her heels anyway off topic there. Um, but it's the other day. She came out with a summer dress on and it was strawberries all over it. She's like I'm wearing this to school and I'm like, well, how do you want? It's like 20 degrees outside. Yeah, we got to wear tights we get tights on her and then it was just like the World War 3 with the seam in the thing in the boot and the we couldn't make it work. So finally like she's like in the living room no clothes on. She's like, I'm not going to school today. This is Aeolus and I'm like, well, you have to go to school one. So then we're trying to be logical. I'm like, well you like to go down the flagpole at school. So if you don't wear tights you have to your legs gonna get really cold on the flagpole. Yeah, and you can get hurt like you could get frostbite or something. So what finally be like agreed to pants and a shirt but it's like whoo buddy, like the sock thing is a challenge for us right now. So today I Center in glit like some glittery looking Ugg boots. What does it we don't have to wear socks because they're furry on the inside. So compromised. Yes, that's good. Gravy, how about you?	-1.0

We've all just kind of had that like low-grade just like thickness of like coughing and not snot and just junk and so at least this morning was I did here coughing a lot last night but this morning she comes out and she's like, I don't feel good all she goes I got to lay down before I pass out heard your men like, okay, so it's hard because the other day she goes mom. I do admit sometimes I do lie, and I just don't want to go to school but this time I really don't feel good. Oh, so we're really working on like the telling the truth. Yeah and up to give you a millionaire have book The Lying is it's a challenge because like that's the worst to me like being a liar is like it's awful because no one can trust you. And so we're trying to teach her that well when you tell us you don't feel good and you're lying about it. We can't trust you. So go to school. I have laid in bed all day. See you at 4:00.	-1.0
