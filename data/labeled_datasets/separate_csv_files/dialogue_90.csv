1	Welcome to the trail Runners experience with your host Daniel phrygia and Ashley dhruv now go and put your shoes on put your headphones in and let's go for a run. Good a trail Runners. Welcome to the trail Runners experience. I'm Daniel and I'm sitting here with Ashley. Dhruv. How you going? Mate?	1.0
2	I'm going well as a Daniel and I have already been talking this morning. So this is kind of yeah, but of a rehash, but yeah for this this morning, but very run out there for eight weeks. I've been really ill and it cancers just been kicking me a little bit and this morning I actually felt like a runner again, so It's a special day.	-1.0
1	Yeah, that's good man night and you got your running legs back and you've recovered from black hole I dare say I wouldn't say that.	1.0
2	I'm recovering from black all yet.	1.0
1	I meant yeah together. Yeah, you definitely would be on the mend. Oh, yeah, definitely definitely fantastic. Yeah, so I'm as you know, I ran over the weekend and I competed in my Fifth attempt at the highest and 105 which is here in South Australia and it is with my fifth attempt and my third finish so I've dnf'd it twice the first time I dnf'd it back in 2013 and then I dnf'd again a couple of years later mostly through just sheer in experience and not really knowing enough, you know, but they're not dying.	0.0
2	About the course do not know enough about or not knowing enough enough about ultrarunning not know about that yourself, like all of the above. Can you tease that out for us?	0.0
1	Yeah, all the above are the first year was man of massively green behind the ears and it was a it happened to be a very hot year as well. It was the race was only a couple of years old at that point and I remember I ran out of water in 2013 I ran out of water going About the halfway point which is a really tough section because you you're alone for 22 kilometers and then but yeah, so ever since then I'm a lot more on to it with with what I'm going to like. I'm onto it more with just everything. I've learned a lot more about running about the course and about pacing and so yeah, so this year was it was it was a good run for me wasn't perfect. But I don't think they'll ever be a perfect race, but I'm very pleased with my time and I thought I might take you through a little bit and if I know there's some fruit if 10 is perfect.	1.0
2	What would you give it?	0.0
1	I'd give it a 0 to 10. So and it's perfect zero. Our bdnf.	-1.0
2	Yeah, I got with a did probably call zero DNS Dion start. Let's go with it.	0.0
1	All right. Well, what's a dnf then like a 1 or a 2 then F all depends how far you get in the race?	0.0
2	I reckon hmm. That's a big advantage that one for yourself. But definitely think it did not start would be 0 because you didn't even stop.	1.0
1	Yeah. So let's go with tens tens awesome made it to the start line. So I guess I and I had a good time. I've got a PB I would All the it an eight and an eight.	1.0
2	Well, that's pretty good. Yeah, I say 80% 80% correct in a hundred K race. There's a bloody good race Yeah.	1.0
1	So basically I jumped in like conditions were pretty much perfect. So two days before on the Thursday the weather it was really hot was like 37 38 degrees here and you know, you sort of thought. It was going to be like that. They would have cooled the race off. And then thankfully it cooled down on Friday. I went from 38 down to about 15 degrees like was crazy and it was raining and windy and so didn't really want that either too cold to win. But then so the of the morning of the race it was cool, but clear and there what was a bit Breezy at the start line and But you really I'd rather be a little bit on the cold side at the start line and and which is you know, so it was perfect at no point did I think I'm too hot and so yeah really lucky in that regard. And so yeah, it took off with the crew. And so this is a lot of people who are listening who are local live in the south Australia area and know the race, so this will Echo a lot. So we've had a bit of rain here. So things were very green. So the whole course looks beautiful this show is awesome. And so lots of you run through lots and lots of farmland and through quite a few conservation parks and everything was just Lush and green and so we and it is just and I really did spend a lot of time really paying attention to the course around me even though I've seen it a lot and I know I'm very familiar with the course. I always try to make a point of being aware of the beauty and of what I'm doing rather than just focusing in on myself too much and being because I find when I focus in too much on my my what's going on in my head I end up falling into a hole and negativity hole. So yeah first I wanted to start out slowly and first 500 meters. I started out nice and slow and then we one of the things we do. In this race, you have to climb a lot of fences like Farm barbed wire fences and stuff. And so on the highest and Trail they have these Styles setup, which is like just a little steps that go over the fence and throughout the hundred case. There's probably dozens. There's so many of them you get so sick of them by the end and it just gets so hard to climb over the fences and it slows your right down and the very end so	1.0
2	Permanently or is this yes added by the race?	0.0
1	No, they're permanently. So the - okay the highest and Trail is a long distance trail that goes from the very bottom of the flu.	-1.0
2	Yo Peninsula, which is down Echoes 1200 case, doesn't it?	0.0
1	Yeah, it does goes from Cape Jervis across the bottom of the floor area up sort of near Victor Harbor, which is nearer we start at y pinga and and then it goes up through the Adelaide Hills generally. Then across right past Mount lofty and right up into like sort of not far from the Clare Valley and and then you end up it finishes in the Flint North and the Flinders ranges like up in the desert. And so obviously we just covered the bit down on the this south of Adelaide and so basically going from wiping out to kaipo Forest for those who are not from here that doesn't really make any sense, but locals know all about About it. And first thing I will say if you're not from here, this is like becoming a really good 100K race. Like I've seen it grow over the time that I've been doing it and Ben Hawkins is the race director and who sort of the founder of ultrarunners essay and he's also a very good friend of mine. He has just he put his heart and soul into these races and he he goes he was so he was a crook as a dog on the day he could barely speak. Because he had and his wife is 38 weeks pregnant and he was there at you know, and he just from from Son Well Before Sunrise and too well to the very last Runner came in, you know, like he just you know, they'd lose race directors work hard and then also that the rest of the team like been pieman, pardon me and and Michelle Hanlon and probably a bunch of names. I'm going to forget plus all the a station volunteers. They all everyone just works really hard. At this race and this year was the best year. So anyway, I took off really fast. I'm running along I get to the first style to step over the thing so and hang on. Hang on.	1.0
2	Yep. So you've completely broken your own rule already I get taken off fast.	1.0
1	So I know I didn't take off fast. I'm jumping here because my brain doesn't work here - come on me. I'm still covering. I think I may have got got some brain damage. No, so I didn't take off fast. The first k I felt very comfortable first sort of 500 meters or so. I felt very comfortable. But there was a big pack of guys blocking the track in front and then we came came we came to the first style and climbing arnall and then you're waiting you just standing there and then I thought there's going to be so much of this waiting. And so what I did I thought I'm just going to get myself some space and I like so I jumped when I climbed over a style. I just accelerated and I broke away and I I just I wanted to put a bit of space between me and the group because I just got sick of this is where local knowledge comes into its own. Yeah, and so I known as I pushed her and I felt great which was a good feeling, you know, like I didn't feel like I was running threshold or anything else till conversational. But yes, I was running about five minute case in that first couple of kilometers and and running you're running through paddocks already and through long grass and and the lead At that point I was in second place. So Andrew Hoff who's a phenomenal Runner who I interviewed on the podcast a while back. He was already after a kilometer. He was already a couple hundred meters in front. And so and then he disappeared and went on to break the course record broke broke Brandon Davies course record, and I think he got 9 hours and 43 minutes so which is phenomenal and he's and I would dare say that and Who's not even in the best shape of his life yet? And so he's just a good runner. But anyway, so I'm running and I probably about the first ten kilometers. There's no major. There's a fair Climate about kilometer 6 to 7, where you go up this long road, we your dirt road and you just it's a it's a just a grinding uphill climb and there was me and this other this young bloke will running together second third for all of that and just we'll just check. But we will just sort of holding a reasonable pace and then we came down through the forest into Inman Valley which is checkpoint 1 and about that would be it about kilometer 16 and I was very quick turnaround. I got I filled up my my my bladder filled up grab some food said Thank you to the volunteers and then we were off again and So from from checkpoint one to the next checkpoint to is your where it starts to get a little bit tough, you know, so you there's only five checkpoints in the whole race. And so you really got to be self-sufficient and I was feeling really good at this point. I was just like yeah loving it conditions are good legs feel good. Everything felt good. So I kept running a bit well, and then there's a fair grind as you going up another Hill and you work your way on these Road Hills until You come to the first technical section, which is not until about kilometer 24 23 24, maybe. Yeah 24 and your head into my ponga Conservation Park, which is go so you're going from running on these dirt roads. It's very runnable, even though there's some climbing to the some of the most technical terrain you can get and it's a this is the part that breaks people really early. This is actually where I had my first low point. So you're going to my ponga their traffic is it just yet was there for a second?	1.0
2	Yep, what what makes that section technical. Is it Rocky? Is it steep is it doesn't twist and turn everybody what what sort of technical is it?	1.0
1	So the trail is very narrow and I'm in terms of like you've got those are grass trees. They used to call them black boys or not. Yes. Yeah, they're everywhere. And so you've got to hold your arms. Out in front of you very Rocky Trail and yet James changing direction constantly and then it's and then lots of ups and downs like so your one minute you'll be okay. So you can never get a consistent gate not even close and if you look on my almost rather, I went from running five and a half minute Kay's to nine-minute gaze to 11 minutes rise. And and so I was really it was hard to and I That was the point where I was like, okay, I need to put it is a slow down here for it. Yeah, you're pushing a little bit too hard too early. There's a couple of real steep lung busting climbs there. They're only so you're going up like 40% gradient, but it's only for probably 20 or 30 meters but there's lots of little climbs like that. So and then it's all those hands and knees kind of stuff, you know, like and then and and it's very easy to get lost in that section and I know for a fact A fact that a lot of people did get lost taking because this is Trails going off in every conceivable Direction into the scrub and it's beautiful, but I don't know it can it's a little bit too moralizing and that section goes on for maybe 4 or 5 kilometers. I get so does seem to go on then you're going through paddocks and then you go on to more Road and then so about kilometer 30 you hit the road or 31 and then it's about On ches to the next aid station, so to a checkpoint two and that's where my first drop bag was. So I got there feeling not fantastic but not terrible. Like I was all right, and I remember coming through there in about three and a half hours, which was I was happy with the time that I was there even though I just so I slow it up a little bit but I was still passing other because it was a group of people that started at six o'clock. So the slower waves started at 6 a.m. M and the faster wave started at 7:00 a.m. So at that point I caught a few of the six o'clock wave people wouldn't always say hello on the way through I saw at all that shout out to Dion who is one of the ladies I used to coach who completed High School 105 last year and she is an absolute Legend and I coach to through that last year and she gave me a big hug at checkpoint 2, which is really just You know that kind of just really lifted my spirits. So yeah, so checkpoint to grab my bag. I drop bag and stuffed in lots of food because the next section from checkpoint 2 to 3 is what I call the death zone. So it's basically it's the hardest section for multiple reasons. It's 22 kilometers between Aid stations. It's got more really technical climbing. And it's the most exposed section of the course as well. So we went through that and I thought okay if I can get through this next 22 kilometers in about 3 hours. I'll be happy. So so now going through going into what is called a just after the Aid Station you go into you'll T Conservation Park, which I always say it's like deja vu it feels the trails feel exactly like the previous. I should Park really Rocky and twisty and up and down and just like impossible to get a rhythm going and that goes for about a kilometer 30 37 or 38. Maybe maybe 36 2 plus 1 3 or 4 kilometers. I pulled out some pretty slow kilometers through that but I'd used I was feeling a bit negative in that point and I thought this is where I need to just back. Back off a little take the pressure off myself and just to get acknowledged that it's going to be slow. No matter what I do. And so I slowed down eight and I thought when I get out on the runnable sections, I'm going to run and and that's what I did. And by the time you get out to about a kilometer 40 you are certain you can sort of run a bit more you're running through these paddocks though with a grass is so long. Like I'm talking up around my past my waist. You're going through these Farms. Yeah. And it's it really likes get really itchy. You can't say yeah, you can't see the ground and sea running and you don't know whether you stepping in a hole or anything because it's where the cows have been. It's really uneven. So that's technical in a different way, you know like and so I but I managed to get through there without twisting my ankle too badly and I got to about kilometer 45 and I'm coming up on this road and I saw lots of cars coming around this country road and then I remembered that the race has changed this year and they now have a 60 kilometer and 37 and I was coming up on the very start of the 60 kilometer race literally as they were about to start and so perfect. I came in at the back and I was about 50 meters from the start line and heard the three two one and then they all started running and so for the next few case, I had people to run with which is fantastic, you know. It will lift and I think made the rice so much better having a having it finished that way and you run across the hindmarsh tears, which is sort of you this exposed and the road it's kind of endless paddocks and I'd say this is yeah. Like I said, it's the Death Zone on the hot days. It's really hard to get through this section. And then I was starting to I was feeling all right, and then I thought I'll smash some gel. Elle's and I've been I've been drinking my infinite fairly like a being a good boy making sure you're staying on top of my nutrition and my hydration and I had and then about you get to about kilometer 53 and you're at the top of this road called. Would Cone Road and it's it's a four kilometer downhill on on bitumen and dirt road all the way down to the aid station. So it's a real relief you get there and it's not too steep that it hurts but steeper. After you can get a nice roll on and I think what did I do? I was managed to get onto a decent pace through their back so might sort of my goal was every time I was on a runnable section was to try and get into the low six minutes per kilometer. And and on this on that section. I got down under six minutes days and just felt sad to feel good again came into the a station feeling great thinking. I've only got a marathon to go now and it got there. In six out and six and a half hours.	1.0
2	So basically that that's 22k section took me three hours like challenging said, you know, you're you know, you're an ultra Runner when you say I've only got a marathon to go now.	1.0
1	Yeah, exactly. I know other don't worry part of you is like, I've got a marathon to go that sucks. But then I was like no don't let that throw. It's a marathon yet only a marathon and but yeah and at that point, you know, you're starting to cross paths with more people. It was and then so I grabbed another at drop bag with some more food in it. And the next there's about 18 kilometres to checkpoint for and it checkpoint for I had my buddy run. I was coming on to join me for the last sort of 27 on ches. That was Aaron Cole batch and Aaron, it was great. So I sort of push through checkpoint to checkpoint for and you go through this section. It's my favorite part of the whole race even though about kilometer. He or the high 60s you're going up through what's it called Mount magnificent and into the fitness Conservation Park and it's just the so pretty through there like its Farmland at this is beautiful farm houses nestled in amongst these like really spectacular Rolling Green Hills. It is and the kind of Rocky, but they're also really green. It's just lovely and I really focused on Deserving that but also I focused on again anytime I could run I would run out hit the hills if it was a hill I would be if I was walking I was power hiking like I was really just wanted to keep my time to get my legs moving. And so I was at managing to power like it under 10 minutes per kilometer, which I was happy with so not nice work. Yeah pretty quick. There were people quicker than me at that. But you know, and at this point, I'd Fallen back a few places, but I sort of was focusing more on. And what I was doing and not worrying too much about the race itself and just worried about my own race. And then so again to check point for which was glorious and I for the first time I thought I'm gonna have a little sit-down at checkpoint for for a few minutes and that's that was my little reward for being very efficient through the previous age stations. It's at this point you at 77 km/h know you've really sort of broken its back and I Saw My Buddy Aaron and it was just you know reinvigorated me and it was funny though. My brain was getting a bit muddled as it is kind of now and I went to take something out of my back. My back was the first time I'd taken my pack off as well. I took my pack off briefly or took something out and I just somehow everything fell out of my pack and like I just had my shit everywhere and it's like I don't know how to put this back in and it's like I've been people laughing at me and And she's a really good atmosphere there and everyone just friendly and I got it all back in probably spent longer there at the age station that I really wanted to but you know it is what it is and it just some you know, it was not that was not part of the plan. But then with Aaron she just can't be honest and kept me running when I could run and made sure I kept sipping fluids and eating a beer and like it was a turn into a beautiful afternoon. Coming into the last sort of you come into kaipo forest from the last sort of twenty five k's and it's a pine Plantation. And so all right. Yeah. So pine trees everywhere. We've got a nice sort of feel and one going between farmland and pine plantations and like really I didn't have any like spectacularly low moments. I just I feel like I mean I was at low power low ish points, but I just was able to manage those low points better than I have in the past. So I'm really happy about that. And so my goal was always initially my main goal. I wanted to get under 12 hours, but I knew that was off the off the Record like 12 hours is pretty lofty goal one day one day one day but my next goal was to beat the Sun and so I thought I can still do that. So I had to do about under 13 hours to do that and I came into there's only nine kilometers between checkpoint four and five and I remember coming and so it's really nice short break. I grabbed a sat down had a ginger beer at checkpoint 5 didn't try to see there too long stuffed in some noodles. What took them on the go and I ate some of them and then had to ditch the rest because it was just getting a bit too hard to eat and I remember I had a what happened next? Yeah, then the last sort of 10 kilometers. Yeah, sad to feel a bit nauseous and then you know, but kept positive Aaron made me laugh and I was trying to high five as many volunteers and Spectators that I saw a long anyway, and then coming into the forest. I know the course really well the final and I actually from previous year. I had a landmark point where I knew. There was one kilometer to go but somehow this year I went past that last kilometer to go Mark and didn't notice and then I came around the other shit. The Finish Line was right in front of me was like just straight up by 200 meters and so some like always and I always was like somewhere I was able to leg it for the last couple of hundred meters and I managed to finish without using my head torch and not needing it probably if I was out for another 10 or 15 minutes. I would have had My head towards yeah, but I didn't need my head towards cross the line in 12 hours and 48 minutes and I'll start. Yeah, well, that's brilliant. Yeah, it's good.	1.0
2	When you have those, you know the goals that you kind of making up on the Fly. Hmm and you know, they're very like there's a very definite end time it's dark. I'm going to put a headlamp on yeah, you like you're aiming or I'm going to get out of this aid station in x amount of time, but still completing everything. I need to do like that. Just I love that sort of on the go. You'll make him. Yeah, you know you Got your big girls that you've written before hand. But those ones kind of come up to just kick you in the butt. You know, you kicking yourself in the button going. That's let's keep going. Let's keep going. So your big goals working and then you making up little goals to make it all come together.	1.0
1	Yeah. Exactly. No, it was good. It was such a good day. Like as always, you know, it's like an emotional roller coaster like with these there's things always are but I think when you the more experience you get get better. At riding that roller coaster and managing the roller coaster that makes sense. You know, you don't yeah, I just felt like it was I mean, I remember the first it was this familiar feelings. Like I yes, I know this feeling I've been this low before I can get out of it and then you know, I'll might eat a potato and now make me feel a bit better and it does it. I don't know. Yeah, it's weird but not as good and you know, like I say and some phenomenal This is one of the ladies I coach Jennifer at. Oh sir. She is 50 years old and she finished. I think I trained her little bit too. Well, I coached in a bit too. Well because she was only like 14 minutes behind me or something. And so thankfully, I mean not that it wouldn't be terrible if she'd beat me but you know, I'm competitive I don't you know, she she did really well and she was wrapped and up the first series. The name of the first woman and then was a lie someone I've never met her before. She probably had me on my half an hour but there's a lady named Sonia Jansen who I'd love to try and get on the podcast if she's listening and she she only had a baby six weeks ago. She's phenomenal, you know, like and she still did it in just on 13 hours, you know, like it's just an incredible performance. So lots of people that just blows my	1.0
2	Mind it really does.	1.0
1	Hmm.	0.0
2	I'd love having a chat with her be awesome. I'd love to know like how far into her pregnancy she continued to run even if Scott or she even stopped running for that matter to be able to pull it all back together with six weeks. And then yeah then win.	1.0
1	Yeah II but still said, yeah, I'll second.	0.0
2	Yeah even so II holy Dooley.	1.0
1	That's just yeah now Daisy really good. But yeah. So that's what that was. My that's my recap of why someone I-5 and lots of fantastic stories out there and so many inspiring people, you know, like like always at these events and I mean I tell you what the Finish Line party pretty awesome there. It's like you're in the forest Pine Forest / eucalyptus Forest nearby as well. You've got it come up this sort of Avenue of trees to the Finish. One and there's these big raging bonfires going you've got music pumping just a really good vibe at the finish line. And I just yeah, it's got the and the finish line and it's like lounges set up everywhere. It's like if I wasn't so exhausted I would have been able to participate a lot more when I Collapse on the lands for a bit and then I went and slept in my car, but it was yeah, it's worth it just for the video Finish Line. And party. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so there that's it. Awesome. Yeah. Well done cheese it. Yeah, that's another one down. And now I'm just going to recover and so yeah today what's next for you.	1.0
2	What is next for you?	0.0
1	I don't know yet. I'll I'll have to maybe next week. I'll hint at it. I've got a few little things possibly on the burner, but I don't want to say anything on the record just yet. But yeah. Possibly something in January. So right. Okay. Yeah, but so this week's episode is a conversation we recorded with Lauren Che that correct? Yeah. All right. Yeah, so she's a good runner and she where does she live again? She lives like a good runner. She's putting a little yes the phenomena and she's crazy. Yeah, not very and again humble and and friendly and she likes my band. So the leather pleasure toys. So for those of you that are familiar with episode that was about me you'll know all about that. She listened and she's a fan and so what can I say? I'm popular No, it's yeah now right come on great chat. And so I suppose we'll just jump into this before we get into that chat before we travel on any longer. But yeah, so awesome. Yeah. Well we'll touch base again in the next episode.	1.0

I met Lauren this year on the fishing belly rail trail first time that we met and from my point of view lines bit of machine when it comes to running. I don't know that she knows how to do anything else because it would appear that that's what she does all day long, but we'll get that confirmed or denied as we go through the next hour. I guess. It's welcome Laura. Thank you very much because it'll be him fantastic.	1.0
1	And so you're joining us from Brisbane. Is that correct?	0.0
2	Yeah, I actually didn't do know she's in the scenic rims over a little bit outside of Brisbane In The Sticks. Excellent. So yeah, get over. Yeah that little bit more people take it anymore the traffic getting have any counter and it will keep them off the road and life will be good. It's know what the rooms my oh, yeah your life. So I used to drive down the Boon of quite often because there is some beautiful rock climbing just outside of winner and I used to spend a lot of time. Yeah, my baby, but the closer than that, which is frog buttress. So yeah, pretty much. Yeah, absolutely beautiful and now French out of actually has two lichens that are only found on that rock face in the whole world so little bit of trivia there. You go. It's like you came second on the weekend in a 101 K rice named after the area women. I did I did. Yes. It was dumb the inaugural cynically Mantra and there were two courses that was the sort of course, which was not really short at all the 69 case and then there was the a hundred and nine point seven which K one and that's the one I do. Yep.	1.0
1	Out that was the cost like you're a tricky.	-1.0
2	Yes. It was it was brutal and I was fortunate that I live nearby. So a lot of it. I have run on the floor but a lot of it was also on private land and so I hadn't seen quite a bit of the course, but I'm I mean it was beautiful and I loved it around here. The scenery is stunning and it's quite dry at the moment. So it is it's dark and brown, but it's mountainous. And there's the dam. But yeah, it was it was tough. It was very hot to everyone suffered in the heat myself included and I run in the middle of the day most days and yeah, it wasn't easy was it was really hard but that's what we doing. What are we doing to stop we go to Suffer Well, yep. You're the worst worst of conditions the better the suffering. Yes, a bit of the same flaws of the end. It was very unceasingly hot having said that for the number of races that I've been to or watched online this year in South East Queensland. It would appear that it's either been unceasingly hot or unceasingly cold during the actual races. It's just the way the year stand out. Yeah interesting. It makes you respect Mother Nature that	-1.0
1	Sure, it's funny with the winner rise in the weather plays such a huge role and it's one thing with Avenue control. Yeah, so how do you cope with unfavorable conditions? Like what's your mind a certain mindset that you take into it, or do you just try and train your conditions?	-1.0
2	Well II I train a lot In the Heat of the is it gets very cold here in the scenic real during winter and it's actually quite cold still here at night and in the morning, but during the day it's can get very warm especially in summer. I can only run after I drop my daughter off at school. I've have my own business and work from home. So normally I get up super early do some work dropped off at school. They both of my run after 9:00. And so it's really hot but even so the weekend Is so but but I guess I just know to really take it easy. I just dialed it back. I kind of knew what I was in for hate liars. That's not to say I didn't feel it. I've I did think I drank 17 made this place of water throughout the day went. Well, this is yeah, but that's not an exaggeration. Yeah, I just took it as slow and I just knew I just I guess I didn't know what I was doing for in terms of the weather. Yeah. I saw a lot of people. People really suffer. I felt terrible for them. It was a it was a hard day, but it was a great day still the bodies were fantastic at the checkpoints. The organizers did such a great job. Yeah.	-1.0
1	I think we spoke to a few race directors on this podcast and I just I always I would I don't envy their position when the weather gets really hot and about There's been some races here in Adelaide with it. The race had to be cancelled when the temperature got I think it was forecast to be over 35 degrees. And that was this particular race. That was the cutoff point. When is that? We can't do it and people give it and I'm really good friends with this particular race director in the the cops. A lot of grief when he has to cancel the race, you know every yeah. Yeah, so I don't know why God have you ever been in a race where the weather has been so I mean obviously on the weekend, maybe go into more detail about that you drink 17 liters of water people suffered. Did you did it? Was it indicative of reflect your time you finish second. So like do you still remember on suffering equally it was a work day.	-1.0
2	Yeah, and the field wasn't huge. I have to say a lot of people also dnf'd and there was the option to At a certain point you could decide if you wanted to continue doing a hundred and nine or instead do the 69k option and a few people chose that option. I was determined to finish. I want to buy cowboy hat, which is what you've got if you finish the hundred and nine case, but yeah, I don't know. I just um, I just pulled it along with you just want to always do just just put a lot to take a checkpoint to checkpoint Jenga homework. I do feel nauseous for myself. The day I felt quite it all I didn't eat a whole lot that. I really kept my fluids and electrolytes. And so yeah, that was more electrolytes taking it slow heat up. Yeah, excellent. And if you give to give the to give the listener and not some idea it was 10 degrees above 10 degrees Celsius above normal. So about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and probably a little bit less maybe 70 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit above the normal temperature. Tommy year so it was really a guy that gets fixed. It's a very exposed area there.	1.0
1	So what so time and you do not mind me asking I can't remember exactly was a bit under 18 hours.	0.0
2	I think so we started at 6:00 and I feel it's just before midnight. So look, I was pretty happy with that. I really this was the first event really wasn't sure what my time is going to be. Also, I did serve Christ two weeks ago. So I was a bit tired and you don't back on other ways mainly, so how are you managing your recovery between these all these big races? Well, I don't like tapering. I pretty much do everything. Everyone says you shouldn't do Don't really take the much. I hate it. This one I stop moving my body just seems to Fall to Pieces. So I just keep moving. Yeah, you know, I don't I didn't let the day after the skinny remote right was going to go for a walk. I would normally would in the end I didn't so, it's Monday. I went for a run today. I went to run I'm not huge like tip yesterday was 10ks today living pays and quite slow so down. I just watched. I just enjoy it. I have to keep moving and Yeah. Yeah, just what what's your version of the quite slow? What today was about six minute codes? Yeah, okay, because I was going to say because you can move so just run with you. You know, I couldn't I couldn't endure. I guess I'm not I wouldn't consider myself someone whom is faster Speedy, but I seem to be able to put along and keep going. So yeah just before	1.0
1	She was telling me that you do like in quite a lot of mileage and you yeah you so you'd knock out quite a bit of mileage when your daughters in school. And so what cop was an apology doing every week like on average.	-1.0
2	On average, I guess about a hundred and thirty so usually between the hundred in it or a hundred and a hundred and seventeen days a week. Yeah.	0.0
1	Yeah, so that is being mileage and and obviously Joe do you use like are you training for of paint your pace going training on heart rate or just your perceived effort? Do you just do things like feel a lot or like, you know, maybe mainly feel yeah.	1.0
2	Don't have a coach. I've have never had a coach. I do things where I feel I guess. I don't have a plan as such I I know generally what I need to do like a long line of need to take it easy still if you interval sessions a week, but I don't if I have a set plan with this is what I'm doing each week and just kind of I can't really need to because life is hectic. I just have to fit around my daughter and my work as best as I can that are generally I'll do I do a lot of longer. ER well what I call mid-length runs so often I'll do a 20K run in the morning and then in the afternoon, I'll do strength training and all be fishing on the treadmill at the gym because I can take my daughter with me to cut. It has a bit of a muck around with the other cubes. And yeah, so that's right on the weekends. I usually do a longer run as well as I can but even so my long runs on the weekends. The time factor and not usually that long probably 40 K is most often even that long. Yeah, I know and so like let's go back in time.	1.0
1	Take us back to where you're running career sort of took off where did or when you first got into running and running long distances?	0.0
2	Like like you are now so when that couple start I'm 37 now and but I started biting I guess around 24 24 23 something like that. And it was just too I went to the gym instructor said he's doing a program for me it is like how far can you run on the treadmill my other brother and I didn't I didn't run and so well, so I just Start a street lights and street lights doll and it all went downhill from there. Basically first it was to lose weight and then, you know just loved it more than I did my first 5k first 12K, then my first half marathon which in I was living in Darwin at the time and I just I'll never forget that feeling a finish my first half marathon. It was just like I never in my dreams thought I'd be able to do that, but someone like me to do a half marathon. Um, yeah, it was a wonderful feeling and then you just keep pushing the envelope that bit further you people thinking maybe I could try doing this and that's just that's just how it happened to I've had some time off here and there in the past. I've got had been injured and when I was pregnant and after I had my daughter I had some time off but you're just the past maybe four years. I've really really got back into it.	1.0
1	Yeah, and I hear you ran quite well. The recent trip kind of century that correct.	1.0
2	Yeah, I think I got just under 12 hours. I think it was 11 hours 38 minutes. So I got my got a big mug, which was not a subject to be honest wasn't sure if I'd be able to achieve that but I did which was great because I did serve Coast last year and I'm I've got my little mug then I had a horrendous time. It says closed last year. I didn't realize it at the time but I actually had infected corneas and I ended up spending more in hospital. I had to go to him. DCI. Yes. It was the most the most painful thing. I've experienced besides childbirth. Yeah, so to go back and get under 12 hours was pretty cool. Yeah, it's amazing. How did he get infected corny is no idea. I don't know how I got infected couriers. I knew something was wrong. I thought it was. It was conjunctivitis, but then it became apparent that it was worse than that and I really didn't start but then I thought well if I could just make it to checkpoint to its DNS is better than a DNS and then at the checkpoint to my there's a few drawings. It was a long day. That is a huge blur in my mind. I don't remember it very well because I could barely see but one thing and I was it a lot of paid and apparently the weather was terrible, but that just didn't register with me at all because I had other things on my mind, you know, wow finished. Yeah, right seen hours.	-1.0
1	You feel like a race like that with you know, something is pretty catastrophically wrong and where you battle through you feel like those races are worth forgetting or really holding costs and remembering because the embattled battled through everyone can relate to to go through something similar to that. What do you think?	-1.0
2	I think they really important with this. It's not something I want to go through again, but I still appreciate the experience because I learned a lot about myself I squirted in and when the going gets tough and other races you think back to that if you keep going yeah. Yeah. Yeah it teaches you how deep you can go. That's right. When you think you've got nothing left. You usually got something left. Yeah, I might.	1.0
1	Yeah, so that's really good. And so now we interviewed someone who you know fairly well fairly recently interviewed his broke by the name of Carl for see how you know, come a little bit its colors my partner.	1.0
2	Discuss anything other than running we do you mean running is a big topic of conversation and I'm sorry, we do believe it or not do other things and have all that interested, you know for sure running is a passion for both of us and we do talk about a garage sale. Yeah, we've a savings of little bit differently. Sometimes other people I think laid back about this square is called can be very focused which is fantastic. It's kind of its. Yeah great. However, he could have a Golf and just put it out there. Whereas if I have a goal a bit more guarded about it. I'm not ready to put it out there that is just to put it out there and he'll achieve it. Yeah, he's a great brother. Yeah, he's definitely a good runner. I'm sure private you are so I want you to run through all of your races this year because just What kind of rice no with you but of wrong with you, it was run different events at the same main event and it would appear that I've taken weekends off and you've raced every weekend that's it seems to me so it seems like a year of writing. Well not quite every weekend. But yeah, I'm not a fan of taking time off. I just do as I said things. The fall off when I do that, but I did tell her we're in my life in February this year. I did the I do that with Carl and I did the Brisbane Valley real Colonel Marlowe this year, which I did last year and last year and I actually collapsed a few hundred meters from the finish it my body went into shock, but I've made it I made it to the end with 20 minutes to spare. So I made it I think. 29 hours 40 minutes and this year I finished third third be mailing or just over 21 hours. So I learned a lot from that from last year. I was going to climb so high this year, but it got cancelled. So I did my own bun a high of 50 around being on the same day. So if quote century and soon at your Mantra and a couple of other smaller ones as well, I've done the see that we were traveling series most of that this year and yeah. So you've done about a thousand cases of racing? Is here I'm not good at maths if you say so actually and it's about I think it's a lot. It's a lot of racing. Yeah in strawberryland stronger, but really to make it easier to get my runs on to run down under and love on the weekend just popped over 5,000 cases for the year. Oh, wow.	1.0
1	That's a lot more than me.	1.0
2	This is about double. Yeah. Yeah, it's more than ready to uh, 4400. Well, that's that's not far behind the actually that's great. Sorry. Like that's really what we haven't done anything at all last in the last six days. I have done 10K like just be the case. We'll fix that ready for black or will hopefully on Thursday said yeah, how you feeling about that? Well if the moment I had a chat with we had family discussion about yesterday or the day before and so we just went through cutoff times and my wife said to me five k's an hour you can warp that prong outlet and so that put the at this armor wasn't feeling very motivated. And sometimes I think the more wife doesn't like my running and then every so often she says something like that like just pull your finger out and do the work so Yes, I was actually very good with motivational and although I didn't have a very good not last thought I did run you stay and I'll probably run tonight with how I feel right now. So I look it will be 23 hours instead of what I would have originally liked but I think I'll get it right now. That's my thought. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with 23 hours is still covering that distance and it's an amazing amazing face. Yes, you should Fun. What do you mean to be? I'm happy. It won't be this horse. Yeah. Well, I'm hoping it doesn't pull with rain because a couple of years ago it rained all day and that was just that was not fun. I don't know. I wish I liked riding in the rain.	1.0
1	I don't then I will destroy you it doesn't it a whole day. I've my feet covered. What is your hope?	-1.0
2	Honestly just to finish with you the past few weeks on just yeah, I don't have a time. It's called in fines just finish it and hopefully enjoy it. Let's go I could of course. I am not they don't get caught up in English applied to the stuff that I guess I did a bit easier and I did push it but I have to say I didn't do that. I didn't enjoy it because I was so focused on my time and my pay is looking at my watch. I would rather be somewhere in enjoy it. So yeah, hope you just to have a bit of fun. Yeah cat other people it seems in one piece. It's funny how I mean I'm guilty of this massively.	1.0
1	I mean, I'm a running coach and also a mouth as if I listened to the podcast nose and we get so fixated on top running for a certain time. I finished time and I and I had a client say Only once during the speed session and she'll quite often doesn't want to train with a watch on at all and not even know you're like your $10 digital watches you guys. She said she wishes it there was a watch it didn't measure your time, but measured your your enjoyment like so, you know, especially, you know, if only we had a way of measuring like other metrics for our run and so it'll be good. You know, you get to a point and your little watch says that you're enjoying yourself, you know, like do Native watch for that but because I didn't I get so I do I keep saying on on getting time goals the truck certain training sessions and and making sure I was getting heart rate goals and you know, all that stuff. And yes. Yeah, so I think you would probably you seem like the kind of person who would like to buy a watch. It measures your enjoyment and not your time.	1.0
2	Well, I wonder who'd Gadget person but I don't think I could run without of what should I do like to see See how far I've gone. But yeah, I definitely I just enjoyed the process. I just I like running and then the figures don't excite me so much the statistics of learning often forget my times have to ask how all the time someone to ask me what my finishing time is is what was it a hotel be? I searched for my favorite event. It's no longer in this sadly was the living to be encouraged challenged and that was well over two days and that list from O'Reilly's and learning to National Park and it was there a couple of different course options. But the one I did for two years was the double Marathon. So now it's on Monday get up the next day do it again. And that was that was a tough run but it was such a frenzy and Last week's events and I just had so much fun. Yeah, probably about was still on my night. There's a lamington classic which sounds similar but different that's actually been postponed this year because of the threat for the eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Let me to the Eco challenge was done by chania Adventures. They still do other events. Just let that one anymore. It's been running for the past couple of years. Yeah.	1.0
1	Well, do you have to have like a like a dream rice that you would like? to like to go and do	1.0
2	I'm really hoping to do my letter P until next year. I think I haven't done US World the closest thing. I've done to a stage races that money to be quite a challenge, but the idea of a stage race really appeals to lead us to get up each day and you know try and do something epic again, and I've never run anywhere like that before it's just looks fun. But yeah, I think that would be great.	1.0
1	Yeah. I've heard amazing things about running. Pins out and I know a few people who've done it and yeah, it's I hear it's quite pricey but I don't sort of events are have to be pricing to enter Because it loving logistic is a lot going on forever the races at Daddy but we have a race but I like the South Australia's version of run their Pinta. It's not a stage race, but we have the Hubert 100 down in the Flinders ranges you get and yeah. I'm there every year and it's a fantastic location. There's a 100K in a 100-mile option and there's a couple shorter off TV. Well, it seems like something that you'd be in. Juvie. And I know I'm always really innovating and some Americans the other day and I got I think I've convinced them to ensure it have an eye - you know there.	1.0
2	Yeah, I think that I think they will be out to do that rice. It's very pretty here with some great bargains. Yeah Larkins is awesome. Like Iran parts of that course last year and not running the actual race. I was just out there for part of my trip around Australia, which I was thinking Tom and the make those ranges out there. They just absolutely spectacular. Yeah, it looks amazing. I mean, there's no water so you've got to make sure you carry him off of That yeah, you know luck is no way you can like even if you ducked it like a yellow one of the righteous up here if you kind of run out of water you can duck off to a creek but there's nothing out there is no but it is the views as just something else especially first thing in the morning or late at night. It's yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Awesome. Now, I have a question. I need I need to know the best cow story there is no I'll say this to our viewers. It's Every time that I see Instagram post, yeah, you've got a picture of a cow and we begin it would appear that you just run from cow Paddock to capitec taking photographs of cats. So a lot of cars out here are the nights have been chased by pi was bloody scary. I love cows out here pretty freaky some acute, but most of them are so creepy. Yeah. It's scary fast. Thank you guy fast actually my day. Yeah, we do agree with that tonight when they get up and go their dog. Yeah. Well, I do a lot of running on my own most of it's on my mind and I'm going to entertain my little brain somehow. So I do take a lot of photos and put them on my Facebook page and make fun of myself. Do you do a very you do a very good job of taking photos of cows? And getting the perfect putting the putting this perfect captions to it. It's the largest is you look at the pattern. Yeah, but then you read the caption and you always end up doing yes. If you didn't jump did you actually burn that's the question exactly.	1.0
1	Yeah. I remember I think one of the first it's sort of funny the whole running the race photography like rice photos and really interesting because with the Advent, I don't know if you ever do parkrun or anything like that and I don't do it as often not your thing, but I know there's no path one here.	1.0
2	That knows the five k's, you know, I know Got a hundred cases one case is too hard, but it's a good Community environment.	1.0
1	You know, it's fun. Yeah, but there's always photos and park on and I feel like since parkrun photos. It's just like it's just every Saturday you get like an abundance of all my running friends are posting pictures of their parkrun photos. And I mean, I don't know I'm all for like sharing your running in that but I do Think you know, how many photos do we need to see if the same track it doing the same thing and I don't want to criticize Parker. It's just funny how many we get you get the same parkrun photos every week and it's just like my feed gets flooded you park on yeah.	1.0
2	I think it just got to try and have a bit of fun. But it's that means to be silly Chumps up photos or you know, whatever kind of photos. Well why not?	-1.0
1	Yeah, so I have another question about your training. So you spend a fair bit of what I know about you spent your run by feel you don't really tape up but and you somewhere along the line you recover. I don't know how so you've obviously got a bit of a Natural disposition or maybe just from years of running until dropping pretty decent base, but do you ever have any major troubles with the engines?	1.0
2	I think because over the years. I've managed to beat my body into submission, but it does what it's told but I've been I might not have been running Ultras went. 13 years or whatever, but I've been still running for a long time and I think that counts for something and I do strength training as well. Which for me everyone's different. So a lot of others don't do it and they seem to get by fine, but strength training really works for me and it helps me with my endurance. Maybe I am a bit Lucky in a way that I can recover quickly, but I tend to think not I don't think it's love. I think it's just persistence and just at the cumulative effect of Many years ago breathing. Yeah, I'm lucky. I don't really get major injuries. I had had hip adductor tendonitis in the past. That was a number of years ago now and I couldn't mind for the good part of a year. And that was awfully I do have since playlist. I pretty much always have them but that's a pain I've When it's to make peace with I can handle it, that's about it. All right, I mean after a long run on the weekends, I do get sore the next day obviously, I don't walk though the best but I do bounce back pretty quickly. But again II tribute that to to making myself a move again quickly if I sit down I don't do anything for a few days. I feel terribly just yeah, although keep moving.	1.0
1	That sounds um, Interesting advice. Are you like this sort of active recovery approach? I think is good.	1.0
2	It's yeah, so yeah.	1.0
1	Well, that's I'm really glad that you don't have a major problem injury at think it's a it's sort of Testament. I think to just you running by feel and not sometimes you could probably better at listening to the body than a lot of other athletes myself included some time. I mean, I've had a few in I don't get into what I'm bit like you that I have had a couple of injuries this year, which is big It's train but you know, so yeah fantastic. So another thing that's going to bring up with you is sorry I jumped you again.	1.0
2	That's right.	1.0
1	So just recently here in Adelaide. We had the six day race. So the MI6 day. Yeah, the only one in the country and I spent a fair bit of time down there since very close to Mike to where I live and phenomenal like these guys so they run at one point four kilometer Loop. Around this path, which goes past the nice little like and they do it for six days. And it was just and it got quite warm we had the first couple days was windy and cold and then I got quite hot and we had I think the winning distance in the end was a local guy named Darren Darren Lenny who did 835 kilometers in six days and handling. Yeah was my blind. Yeah. But I just and I know there was some amazing performances right across the board like Annabelle Hepworth you I think he's from Queensland. She came she was second out right? And she said Chris Ryan Chris was there she was the second lady. She bought she did oversee.	1.0
2	Yeah. Okay, they both did overseas. She's amazing. Yeah, I know Christie's she's phenomenal. I've met her a few times at different running things have been kept in touch over Facebook. I've had the pleasure of seeing go finish the 200-mile event at bbrt this year and I ran with her last year for a little bit during the video team Viola. She was there when I had my moments at the end and help me in her parents also were there they were fantastic and Chris is just Yeah, she's the champion of champions. Yeah, I've gotta tell you that. She just gets it done. Yeah.	1.0
1	No, she was fantastic and I love these because this is something that you can do yourself or something like that at this point.	1.0
2	No, but I know I've said no to things in the past and they've done them. But at this point the thought of running around a little track for that long. Yeah, how about you? What I do. Yeah, the answer is I probably would ya he said what actually gets interesting. That's for sure. But yes, the truth is I would I would have a bash of that. Yeah, I think that would be oh, I think that would be a lot of men. To anguish in there for fun.	1.0
1	Yeah, so - yes, and you can go the ramp is a rule becomes a real sense of community because you see each other so often they were in I was down there for a couple of days helping out and just the camaraderie. It's magnified because you're passing each other all the time like you don't give chance. Yeah. So anyway, I wouldn't do the six day, but it's intriguing.	1.0
2	Okay, so there is not that big a town. In fact, I could I think I could I could run around it probably in half an hour to an hour. So imagine you yeah, really go. I imagine that you've read every single Street in Bruner itself. So do you have it? Okay. No, I don't run in town. I've been out of town. Yeah, I don't like running around the town streets. So I like it when it's nice and quiet. So I do a lot of writing on the outskirts of town and along the dirt roads and things like that and you have a favorite course out there or do you just pick something different every day? What I am a creature of habit. I do have my few different routes that I do that my favorite. Is this the Buddha chill illegal trial, which is hardly anyone seems to know about but it's a beautiful little The trail part of the seemingly multiples went along there, but it's nice that you I never see anyone there. It's beautiful. It's undulating. You can see Mount French lie because of the distance of most of its shaded which is unusual for around here. So that would probably be my favorite I can if I start from home you can do that 30 case I suppose those trails. And then next next year I'm going to do the 200 bomb idiotic. Well, maybe the plan. Various lists the various. Wa very nice. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, beautiful try. I'm terrified about Well, I can't say I saw Iran maybe 60 or 70 case on that trail last year. And in that time I think I saw three or four snakes are quite a while snakes on that trial. But yeah, I see a lot of things here. So yeah, that doesn't yeah, but look the run like along the beaches and so on. I just yeah, 'best of Vine country. That's Show this the whole of the logistics of what bothers me the most is getting there and all sort of all that out, but there will get there and you know be an experience. That's for sure. It's nice baby. Sorry, sorry good Daniel night and you go.	1.0
1	Oh just being able to with the logistic sides of these kinds of races even like a nigga like a hundred K race, you know, you've got getting you know getting to a location and getting making sure you've got all your drop bags and your mandatory gear and all that. So yeah, I can't even imagine of them 200-mile race, especially at this point to point in. Well, isn't it? So you are yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so that would be a massive challenge.	1.0
2	And that has worked out and that that cause covers like this go through the massive tree forest. And then you go like along the beach and then you go Inland and you go through waterways and you have to catch boats and we're one of the Sleep stations is I stayed there for four days and yeah, like you're going to get when you get there are things a hundred and twenty cases in so you'll be But that the wildlife in that spot is just outstanding. So what you'll get to see while you're out in the trial will just be mind-blowing really well. I mean, I'm excited and terrified. I'm looking forward to seeing a part of the country. I haven't been which is one of the reasons why Charlie so much because you just get to see beautiful places you otherwise I probably wouldn't it just looking forward to well looking forward to enter. Reading finding out what what happens after that because the longest Iran is a hundred and sixty-seven case just to see what happens after that point. Yeah. I don't know. It's all unknown so we can proceed to find out. Yeah, that's just it is the journey inside as well. That's not enough. That's right. Yep, dude.	1.0
1	Interesting. Do you find that doing Bryce? I mean, obviously you have to embrace that sort of dark applies inside that we all kind of go to some point. They like do you have like a strategy for dealing with the really- places in a race, you know, we need to go deeply into the dark Parts.	1.0
2	Yeah, that's ahead. Because every race is different sometimes the things that too bad like you enter your dark places that it's not that bad some reasons of I'm thinking of the baby are too though. Probably the worst to me when I last year. So I just think back to that if I'm feeling really bad I think back to that. I think this really is not that bad but things could get much worse and that helps me. Yeah, but I also Tell myself a lot if I'm starting to feel crap, and I just want it to end. I just tell myself for this this time is going to pass. Anyway, there's will spend it doing something Kick-Ass something I can talk about later and that helps me keep going, you know.	-1.0
1	The truth to delay going inwards as long as possible really like to try and take in with my surroundings and that's the beauty of travel by me, you know, like focus on again the nice scenery or like a big beautiful Trend that we've seen or all the other Runners, you know? Yeah, I guess inevitably you end up, you know thinking going inside your own brain and then maybe mm. Yeah, I guess that all comes with experience that the more you do it the easier.	1.0
2	Yeah, that's right. And I also love music. So on the most of my training runs on could you every single training that I'm listening to something music or a podcast and during events? I tried not to like put it off until I do start feeling like I need something else to get me out of my life my brain and music really helps me and I'll sing along and I'll do my shredding a guitar and that really helps me. Yeah to me now. Hard parts of a run but I also think you just have to I think it's worse if you try and push the negativity away like just kind of embrace and then it will pass. Yeah, allow yourself to feel allow yourself to cry like I cried on the weekend. I was yeah, I had my low point but then once you get that out of your system pick up again, yeah, yeah.	1.0
1	What do you do?	0.0
2	What when I cry now when you let down when you're in the dark, it's interesting because what I was going to say, there is like when I go for a training run, I generally go for a training run to go in unless in letting you know like out for at the speed session or something and then you know, nothing happens my brains just blank but like if I if I'm where I generally go for a run. That's the reason I like to go running is to going woods, but when I'm right See, I spend meetings far too much time going inwards. And so that's when I like to chat to you know, someone else that I'm racing with and like a hilly course is brilliant for that because on a hill that apart from the elites there aren't too many people who run them. So even though you're puffing up a hill you can actually get you know, a broken conversation going and generally you'll pass like once you 10 10 caves in Two arrays generally then sitting with all the people you probably going to spend most of the rest of the race with and so you get to know people pretty well. And so you can you know, like they can pull you out and you can pull them out and I remember my strongest memory ever was a guy that I was passing and he was out of gels and he didn't realize it he asked if I could take a gel out he got to the stage where he was so wrecked. That the concept of taking his pack off and being out of jail was too much and I gave him one of my gels because he actually run out and there was no way that he was 15 case the next checkpoint and that giving him in my gel made me run faster than if I'd use the gel myself. Yeah because you have someone yeah, and it's and it helped him and after the race he came and thanked me and said I wouldn't you know, you would have never finished the rice if it wasn't for that. Yell at that moment. And yeah, that's probably my favorite memory of racing, you know in all my running. So that's that's my thoughts are going in and out and that's what's so beautiful about an altar and Ultra is it's an entire life in one quick run. Really? Everything is Chandni you end up crying end up hurting you end up falling you end up cheering you sing. You don't seem like there's just Everything in there and that's that's why I love it. So well, I guess I about Lauren's music choice to is she likes rock and roll. I keep trying to convince her to listen to an alternative to rock and roll, but I haven't convinced yet. Well, I do like lots of different kinds of music, but I think you like the Techno stuff which I'm not such a big bet on to say if you scolding you talk idiom. Okay, I don't even know what this is when I'm running.	1.0
1	Running a lighted on the old not running related.	1.0
2	I think a couple of running related ones on this is to actually listen to yours today the podcast on YouTube You'll and I have to say I was very impressed by your garage Funk bands that some played at the end of your episodes. Yeah. Oh honey.	1.0
1	That's that's really nice. Yeah.	1.0
2	Yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah.	1.0
2	I think humans are vulture. I think which Candace pert does she organizes like Todd Tahoe 211 at by the soft and I was on this weekend. Yeah and Ultra gonna put cars so they both US based ones though, but then pretty much the only running one. So I like to listen to fit a true crime and yeah docu-series. Arrange really I just decided many enjoy it because I'm why there's so much to choose from and I know what you say. I should that you'd like to run to go in with Aidan and I do too. Actually that's why I listen to my music helps me do that. But I also like to listen to podcast because I don't get to watch much TV at home with a six-year-old. She Reigns the TV here. Let's also get to watch entertainment c-23 all the time. the time	1.0
1	I have an approach sometimes it works is a good motivator. If I'm out is really struggling to define the energy to get out the door. I'll find a really good audio book or a really good point cast and I'll say I'm only allowed to listen to it when I run over as the only done and so that way I go are really one of us to that podcast. I better go for a run and then it gets me out the door and then once I've started yeah, yeah getting started is the hardest part half the time, you know, so. But yeah, but I mean it's yeah, it's really live in a good time. It enlightens time having all these like so many entertainment choices when they're out running and I think but the same time it is good just to tune in on itself. Like we're sort of going in and out of our own mind here this conversation like what but I think whatever works best, you know, like yeah, I agree.	1.0
2	Yeah. Yeah, it is nice to turn it off and listen to Nature sometimes. But I just love listening to music I listen to all the time. I listen to it. I walk to school to pick up my daughter. I listen to when I'm working. Listen to what I'm running its. Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
1	So by next big question is what's on the horizon for the rest of this year not with as much as any few months left. So running wise you've got the race this the black all coming up.	0.0
2	Okay, so that's all so far this year. I don't have any other events. No, but then I just put just keep doing it and I there yesterday that bag thing again. That's just so I could see me. Oh well as to be done, I'm seriously wondering about taking no drop bags as time. It'll be a first But I'm seriously considering just whatever I carried from this top 400 case. That's it. You could easily do that. The checkpoints are so-called there. I just like to quite often. I don't use anything in my job. There's I just like to have them there. I figure if I don't need it, it's great. But at least it's there in case I do I feel the cold as well. So always have extra warm clothes in my drop bags. I hate being cold. I really suffered in the cold before during events. And yeah.	-1.0
1	Make sure I had extra will close automatically when your when your time so hard to thermoregulate and so you are yes, and I'm on the same. I feel like I'm the first person that's going to get hypothermia in a race, you know, like I even I'm aware of it. So yeah, it's good to be aware of it. Do you have a pin your favorite food that you like to have during the race or	-1.0
2	Oh I have music that is I have a lot of music bars. I don't do gels rarely. Will I have a job if I didn't have a home on the weekend might endure during the be a team on this year only will I have one if I need a little bit of caffeine on have a caffeinated gel on me but I have just food Just Like Music bars. I have scraps like rats with veggie my avocado or peanut butter and jam. I'm started having those fruit patches that you can get Supermarket. They're pretty good is easy to digest this. Whatever's going at the checkpoint chips a good machine and Ginger Beer Mile of our ginger beer is great. If you're feeling a bit funny in the stomach as chocolate-coated Ginger is really good. Just one of those is a really good pick me up. So yeah, probably all the food you shouldn't be eating I will have during an ultra. Yes if it tastes good. This food is fantastic. No, I think that's pretty well covered. Yeah, run run. I think I think the gyms out of today are run by Fuel run often. Don't go too fast and have fun. Yeah, and yes had fun. There's no rules in Rain. No dude there really is. I'm Hazel and enjoy it and you know if that means A hundred and seventy times a week like Lauren dust or let's go for yeah. Yeah, I think just don't be afraid of the bit of trial and error and don't let other people's definitions of successful. Whatever ideas of what you should or shouldn't do Define your ideas and goals. I think, you know, you know yourself better than anyone, you know to what you feel works for you and sometimes it might work. Sometimes it won't but you can only really know for sure if you dry. It someone can tell you. Oh, this won't work. But you won't really understand it in unless you try it so dude. Just don't worry. If you don't fit the mold, I think it's fantastic advice to forgetful advice.	1.0
