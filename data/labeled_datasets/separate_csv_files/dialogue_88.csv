And of course anchor which houses everything that you hear here and we appreciate all of the support and we hope that you all continue supporting us in the Future Let's go ahead and get into the notable new releases. Now we were talking about last episode that we were kind of disappointed because it hasn't really been any music coming out but last week we did get a healthy dose of music. So let's go ahead and go over the new releases 2 Chainz brought out his new project called rapper go to the league, which you had LeBron being a are for which I found that very strange, you know, it's a lot of controversy behind that because they were saying that he did not go to some games or he I'll just just to work on the album, but that's neither here nor there. It was very interesting to change took him onto to be in a are so and he said like this wasn't only project he had them like work on another project to so we'll see what comes through with that but it was a decent album. I listened to it on Friday when it dropped T-Pain Shawty pain because I don't know you probably don't watch it. But I know my girl religiously watch The Masked Singer where they had a whole bunch of whole bunch of Artists and athletes and everything you can name of entertainers dress up in Crazy suits and singing and then, you know, they get voted off of what night and T-Pain want it all and she got me into watching it and I was like, yeah, I was like I can tell his accent. I know that that's t-paint right there and the judge just weren't getting it but he ended up winning everything and if the funny thing ironically though, I would say coincidentally, I won't say ironically coincidentally his New project called wind up drop like the same week that he would so now everybody everybody is thinking that it was just a roll out. This is just to get people to listen to his music. But what did he case his new project called one up that came out like in the middle of the week didn't come out Friday, but go and listen to that Solange. She has been bringing like a lot of visuals and everything and people were like what's going on like she was even like posting a Pedro BlackPlanet people like this Black Planet back. So like right? Yeah, so it was kind of weird it everybody would kind of like speculating what was going on but turns out she has a new project. So she was just doing a lot of promotion for that. So her new project is called when I get home you can go and listen to that little Skies dropped Shelby. I think that this is his second official Studio project from not mistaken. I don't know if we have any little Skies fans that the listen to us, but I believe this is the second official Studio project. So going to listen that if you're a little Skies fan and finally the baby I just get so confused because there's there there's now a saturation of babies out there. We got a little baby then we got double baby. So it's very confusing at times. I like who the hell is is but he's a North Carolina native their child in North Carolina and he dropped his new project called Baby on baby. So very interesting title for a project but those are the notable new releases for the week of March 1st currently its March forth as we're recording. Adding this but these are all the release that came out the week of March 1st. So let's get into the music news. First knew that we have here is Tyrese. Mr. Tyrese is slated to play Teddy Pendergrass and the biopic Now by all pigs have become like very very popular. I think that more and more people were seeing like that. People are very very interested to see some of these stories from the people. You may not know much about you like the inside scoop go through everything that Of that they have been to in their lives and I don't care how many people clown Tyrese I think that he's a good singer. I think that he's a good actor as well. I know he did get called The Fast and Furious stuff, but I mean that's where he made all the bread as I ain't mad and forgetting all their bread and stink it up stick it with the series as long as he did, but Tyrese obviously has been in other movies as well. Like baby voice is probably where everybody remembers him from but he said that Teddy Pendergrass actually asked him to tell his story before you passed away. Not a one thing that I've always. Always had a problem with that. I had an issue with it when it comes to biopics it when you don't actually ask anybody who was around the person or you don't ask the person himself. If you're just going to like make us up as she go that's not a good biopic in my case. But in this particular case with Teddy Pendergrass, he actually is going to have Joan Pendergrass which is Teddy Pendergrass his widow Teddy Pendergrass. By the way. He passed away in 2010. And he's going to have little Marvin is going to come on and write the screenplay and this is all supposed to be Do this by Lee Daniels which pretty much as his hands and everything, so I'm not surprised that Lee Daniels it's going to do this but this biopic but I thought this was interesting though. We have no date as to when it's going to come out. But this is this is all the news that we have so far. So, how do you feel about Tyrese playing Teddy Pendergrass antibiotic?	-1.0
1	Hmm should be interesting is to say the least I would have never thought, you know playing Teddy Pendergrass would be like Tyrese. Yeah, right. It's kind of weird. He's gotta do like, you know, they got to put them in full transformation. I suppose. We'll see how it worked. Oh, absolutely. I think that's an interesting story and then like you touching on like people are really interested in any biopics. I think you know for every for every like good when we do have some bad ones, but I mean, I think when I think of like the good ones, I think like the Bobbi Brown one that was pretty good. The new edition was probably the best one. It was a few more and they are you you have then you have the ones like Alia and the other stuff like that. So it's like it was a couple of the bad ones. I don't want to harp on them. But it's I like I like watching those because you get to see you even when you think you know everything about the artist or something like that that that's public knowledge those little those little tidbits to come in and he's like damn I ain't realized that like, will you watch the Bobby Brown stuff? You didn't know he was hitting Janet Jackson like no. I mean how many people really knew that? I didn't so it was like, okay.	1.0
2	Yeah, well love while stuff. So again, we'll see I will keep you all updated when we get some some proper dates and will also let you know since Lee Daniels is on it. I'm pretty sure this is going to go to the Silver Screen. But again, a lot of these ball picks up going to like lifetime it BTW and stuff. So I'll hope that they you know end up giving it more Justice and put it on the movie theater. So, you know, we'll see how this one goes second bit. Is Wu-Tang they're going back on tour. This is going to be a majority worldwide tour. Obviously, they're going to be in the States but the majority of the legs of the tour or going to be overseas. They are going on tour with Public Enemy and they lost soul and this is going to be called the gods of wrapped or and it starts actually on the first weld it with this is when it did let's give me this one when to take it when I say, oh, I'm sorry, but the actual leg the first leg starts in London on May the 10th, but when they come back to the States, they're going to be in flocks area and going to be in Chicago on June 1st, and then they're going to be in Cleveland Simpsonville, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Asheville Boston on Cassville. I think that's in Connecticut and Landing City Seattle Mountain View, California, Wichita, Kansas Council Bluffs, Iowa, I think and me and hapless, Minnesota on August 2nd. What to end the tour now I know that we did talk about will take last album, which we didn't think was very good. But I'm more than certain expenses just going on tour Public Enemy. They'll also they're going to be doing a lot of old stuff like that's that's just what it is, especially for the we talked about this before as well how a lot of a lot of people overseas like that's where they get their money and if you can still go overseas and still perform all your old hits, then you're still popping and people overseas love love artist over here and they love all of Their old stuff that they that they came out with over a year. So how you feel about this tour with this be something that you will be slightly interested in since they're coming to school.	1.0
1	Yep. I sure would I gotta see what day that's on on the first time. If I can't I made check that out the daylight. So I was crazy last episode we did. I was just talking about them, you know saying how I wished a lot of this stuff was still on with no was on Spotify, but I know about the whole deal though, Tommy Boy stuff and you know, he got this whole boycott with Tommy Boy wish who they were signed with. You know, Tommy blade basically saying de la Sol's I'm a bunch of money. So maybe them going on tour right now is, you know direct result of them trying to get get get out of debt with Tommy Boy.	1.0
2	Hmm.	0.0
1	Okay, and they praised they went on record by praising Jay-Z by not know streaming the music on title because of they like no we're not getting anything from it. So so they praised Jay-Z for that too and sucks a snowman. Yeah. It really does artists that can go overseas like you said. Yeah, man, that's that's huge when people like I don't think people know how rewarding it is that when someone that don't even speak the language no every word of your song and appreciate your music. That's crazy. Like a lot of people think that's weird here. Like somebody come over here ramp rapping in French or something like that or Germany, like what the hell is that? Like it's very rare that one of those type of songs pop here in the US. It's been a couple that would like most of the songs is like not even in language, but it's extremely rare for when they hold. Olga celebrated like that. That's that's tremendous. It just goes to show that the rest of the world is like, you know a lot more appreciative of good music than we are here.	1.0
2	And that's kind of sad. Now. Did you say them out loud? It's the truth though. It is it is, you know for sure about that in June 1st is going to be on the Saturday.	-1.0
1	Maybe off that Saturday too. That's the Saturday before that's like a week before he three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah might have to look into that man through true.	0.0
2	I've got talked about this last but I think it's actually it's a good segue since you mentioned the day or so and Tommy Boy situation. Now this new just came today, but the original story from a few weeks ago our boy Kanye West has been in a legal battle with Rockefeller and Emi who has been signed with since 2003 Kanye West with the Timothy to gain his ownership of his music and receive unpaid royalties, but now the news has come around that's mr. Kanye West has sold his soul and you know, I mentioned that he was with the Amana 2003 but his contract got extended in 2010, but according to this contract and I'm going to read what it says here and I can read the whole thing, but But verbatim it says at no time during the term. Will you seek to retire as a songwriter recording artist or producer or take any extended Hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing your musical career and the same basic manner issue in for sued such career to date. So what that means is that if Kanye loses his battle this man still can't retire like that's that's just wild this is wild. After all it is your trying to get ownership of your music Emi Rockefeller on it. You're trying to get unpaid royalties and they like well, okay no matter what happens. You can't retire bread according to this contract. So it's just another one of those situations where you're not reading fully what's going on or you are reading and you're just willingly signing over everything that you own and everything that you work for. These companies are shady man. And it just it sucks. I know that we made for The Kanye Kanye gun some wild stuff especially last year alone, but I don't want to hear this from anybody. I don't want to hear anybody trying to fight to get ownership of their music and then end up being a Slave at the end of the day because of some loophole or something that the artist did not look at before they actually signed a contract or signed the extension. So, how do you feel about this whole situation with Kanye?	-1.0
1	That's that's rough math. Like they say there's all the time and the music industry. Designed to keep you in debt and this is just another example of it man. It's a lot of these little backwards deals that they that they toss in there to keep you to keep you working to keep they pockets lace while you get next to nothing out of it. It's just it's sad bro. Like I don't ever want to see nobody go through that. Especially someone that works like, you know, the way we know all know Kanye works okay ago in the hibernation and work for like 6 to 7 months straight. No and very seldom calling out for For some time. So I just think that's it's just toughness like never Rockefeller of all, you know of all places like kind of crazy. It just makes you think different about a lot of people that we'd be celebrating even the labels that we'd like yo, they was getting it. It's like yeah, but at what cost a lot of people like basically selling a soul just to get on and years later 15 years later. They still can't they can't even break free of that shit. Like I was just explained with the de la Sol's Shit that they came out with 30 years ago today, you know saying they can't even say not even getting money off of that which is crazy. Like how do you still have a choke?	-1.0
2	Hold on something dirty years ago man, that's just oh my God it just thinking about that. It's super wild 30 years ago and you still can't get money off the music that you created. How does that work, man?	-1.0
1	Sure, rough bro. It's the music. That's the that's the way it goes man. That's why it's like it's like now it's so much easier because most people can just go independent. But you know, then it was like, you know, you'll dream was to be on a major and get your music played on the radio and stuff like that like a lot of artists that going through that now like the product of the you know, I won't say pre internet but before the internet took control of the music, No, so that's just as is what it is man, they'd assign a lot of bullshit deals and paying for it right now to this day.	-1.0
2	Yeah good back then. I mean that was the only way that you were really going to pop and you know as a young kid, especially given your situation, you know, you wanted to just signed a deal you wanted to get that money. So you just did it unknowingly, you know, these kids don't know anything about business. So there's how it is like the labels were literally just taking advantage of all these kids that just wanted to put out some music and I wanted to be famous and get some money.	-1.0
1	Yeah, hoping it'll get greater later and stuff like that. You be like I am and like that's renegotiate this man. I need this isn't this taking off this taking off. I made y'all enough money with you know, if I decide to go elsewhere and 2010 then you know saying it's all good. We just we just cut, you know, cut off what we what we are now. I don't know you you don't know me and stuff like that, but it'll never work out that way. Yeah record label typically always wins that battle now	-1.0
2	Big yikes crooked.	-1.0
1	It's a crooked shady-ass game.	-1.0
2	Yeah. So like I said, I respect everybody who decides to go independent and you know, I know if you do sign a deal that's on you, but I just hope that you have somebody in your corner. If you yourself know that you're not going to be that business savvy and you're not gonna you know, thoroughly read every bit of whatever contracted they're trying to get you to sign. I know everybody want distribution deals and stuff, but honestly you can do you know majority that stuff yourself now as far as like that Tied me.	1.0
1	So we got to have them attorneys dead man present why they sign an issue Brooke because it's probably still going on. It's just not as know up front as it was in but you know, that was always something I always heard people say like don't sign shit unless you know type of business deal that you have an attorney to and not someone that like watching that Toc that was another one the TLC, uh, biopic fact, I was another one reading does she right? She like yo, we want our own, you know, say we want our own Manager and stuff like that. Why would you know, why would we want to you know use somebody from your management company to manage us because they only know how your company and you know, you know best and best interest in mind, you know and not have our best interests in mind and that's how a lot of people get jerk. Could they just so eager to say yo we on we on don't say I play my song on the radio and then when you look up the biggest selling group, you know saying in pretty much R&B female R&B history ended up 50,000 today name, you know say after that record sold millions of copies. So it's just kind of crazy super trashy.	-1.0
2	Another example is rather Compton Ice Cube was smart. He looked at the country like yo like this thing right where my money at Jerry Heller he's giving them all the all the hoopla ride the runaround Trinkets and shit. Yeah, you like yo, I'm out and then, you know, we're trying to get everybody to look at that contract easy one having a dr. Dre everyone having a nobody else was having any like yo you trippin Ice Cube said, all right. I'm out. Out about to go somewhere else and then dr. Dre finally realized after the fact he like yo, like I'm not trying to deal with this no more which you should look like. I know you tried give me all the jury Ellis situation, but you ain't no better. So I'm about to start my own company. So it'd be like they love eventually you realize it. Hopefully, you know, you do get that chance to realize before it's too late and a lot of these artists unfortunately did not get the chance and they did not realize it until again. It was too late and I didn't dealing with this situation and it's very sad man. Very very sad, but Again, we'll keep you up to date on this kind of situation is not looking good for him though. Just because they knew that we got today as a big yikes on this situation real big guys. They literally making this man to slave like how its worded that man's a slave right now. So although being really get out of there because I know this man is being stressed forever and this is just another another hurdle that hopefully he can get through if kind can get his master's dog. It's gonna be over he's gonna definitely be happy man. But if he had my Rockefellers, don't keep a lot Lock on his master's. Yes. It's going to be terrible and then you can't retire either. Yeah, that sucks.	-1.0
1	That's contract basically says we own you. Yeah.	0.0
2	Yeah working. Yeah, you can't do anything on your own terms. You gotta keep working keep turning down music. She's crazy. She's crazy. But let's get off of that. Let's get on some positive news J. Cole says that he wants revenge of the dreamers 3 to come out in April. They're still working on it again that whole like 10-day process which is Louis to get all of the vocals done. I presume the vocals in the production, but obviously takes a long time to make sure to get all the samples clear that they have mix and master everything. So again, it's a process. I know that you know as Fans of dreamville. I wanted you know the stuff to come out a little bit earlier when they first announced it but under their realistically I wasn't going to happen. I was trying to say like the end of February but obviously going to take a longer time in that but he was just talking to some fans the other day and he did not like directly confirm that it's going to come out in April what this is just what he is hoping that the album will come off revenge of the dreamers. Meanwhile, we've been trying to make sure they and the dreamers 3 is done and then put it on video. So the middle child videos now and of course he was at all-star weekend. He performed and participated in the in the dunk contest as well helping out not some people so it's cool man, but I'll open it. It does come out in April like he like he wanted to hopefully we don't as music fans have to wait too much longer because I already know this is gonna be some heat from the previews that we've been hearing and I know Jay ID, for example that man has been on tour going to places and The like previewing some stuff as well. So what are you expecting from this from this compilation album when it comes out flood fire.	0.0
1	Nothing, but fire. That's what I'm expecting. I'll speak nothing less than that. I love compilation album show. So I'm a sucker for a good one. So when that comes out, I'm I'm listening to as soon as Thomas pack some heat and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.	1.0
2	Big fox big facts, so there you go people still no no concrete release date yet. But again, we will keep you all updated on adventures during this 3 because that is definitely my most anticipated project of this year so far. Let's get into the album reviews. We have one album that we are going to review today and that is going to be offset father of four now all set as head of hair. The 2018 the man has been getting it be for people. He got married secretly. He had a child with cardi B and he's been in his share of scandals. Not only did he get into some beef with with Chris Brown. Soulja Boy is going to come at them a little bit. And of course the whole cheating scandal which had pretty much everybody who was a cardi B fan on his head and saying that he was piece of shit and all that stuff. He was supposed to actually release his album last year. Here but ended up getting pushed back and I'm sure that it got pushed back because of all the scandals that he just had to try to salvage his relationship him and cardi end up getting separated for a little bit. But now they're back together taking care of the child and looks like they're being a family and they for the most part gotten through all of that stuff because that's what people when you love somebody. That's what you do. You got to fight to keep your girl and when he ended up bringing out the project, you know, The Breakfast Club and actually respected what he said on the interview, it seems like he's He's evolved and reflected a lot. I know that everybody is Presley these blind fans and want to just automatically condemn somebody if they do one bad thing or they do a couple bad things. But at the end of the day that's his wife, and that's that's his baby mamas life or his wife's like that ain't your life. So who are you to judge when you're on the outside looking in like that's not your thing that you have to go through and it seemed like all say realize that it specially in their Breakfast Club interview and on this album it. Definitely reflected a lot of like what he was going through. He definitely had multiple songs about his children about cardi situation. He apologized and million times on it and it seemed like he actually wants to be a better husband and a better a better father to his the newborn and his other three kids that he had with his other baby mamas now, obviously as far as talent wise talent and celebrity wise, I don't think we know any of them compared to cardi B and even if they did I'm pretty sure cars if he's gonna The biggest baby mama at all I know but but they're still you know, not to not to discredit any other any other baby mamas we had children with but obviously he you know loves all of them just the same and I just think that he's overall just grew as a person which people can do so for this particular album has 16 songs total features Big rule. Shout out to be a group. That's definitely a huge huge thing and Atlanta Jayco Jay Cole been doing a lot of features. I'm actually very Why did he just keep jumping on features? So that's that's pretty well gonna yeah, see low on here Travis guy 21 Savage cardi B. Quavo and Gucci Mane and I will say my favorite songs from this album would be quarter. Millie clout wild wild west and how did I get here? Now as far as this album compared to the other solo albums by takeoff and quavo. I gotta say that I think offsets out. Was the best I would have we said that that was going to happen. Yeah, but I think that we were a little bit worried just because when take off sound came out that was it was very underwhelming. So a lot of people like man, why don't all says I was gonna be but I think that again he had the best album after listening to it. I think he has some really good features. I think that in and this might be a hot take here is might be unpopular opinion. I think the offset out of the Migos is probably the most versatile. Especially after hearing this album. I thought that quavo initially was quavo the hood guy and you know, he he's a good songwriter or whatever. He definitely definitely rent some songs first Ojai name artist, but I think that quavo just kind of got to take a step back because quavo really isn't the lyrical dude. I think they offset is like takeoff and quavo mixing the one I think that he has a bigger a bigger bigger repertoire that Really propels him above his other counterparts and I think they really showed on this album, especially with the features. I didn't find one feature to be like out of place or sound weird North Star was CeeLo Green CeeLo. Green killed that obviously had big Ruban the very first song Father for J. Cole killed and on. How did I get here? Cardi B actually think our DB I'll wrap them which is funny on clout. I think the party be gonna kill - I would like, whoa, I'll say whoa. This is gotta is kind of	1.0
1	Oh, wow, like you said it before I did.	0.0
2	Yeah, I think she actually killed the brunette and then accordingly we Gucci Mane. I think that's my there's definitely my favorite out of all of the songs on here. I just think that be was dull but I like all the production my homies are trying to argue with me and he was like man, he's like just sound like some simple shit he over here talking about his kids and talking about, you know, I'm sorry cardi B every song by Mike. What else are you supposed to do? Like, this is what he's been going through for a whole year. Bam, like I would rather him talk about what's going on his life then fake it and act like nothing happened because we clearly know this something happened. So this is what you do when you grow and you make songs and you make projects about your life. Like you have to grow you have to evolve like obviously he still talking about like the same old shit, like like getting money and mess with women is stuff which I still find it funny because they're like was like, we know what's going on with your life. But you know, you still gotta for the people that I get. Guess halfway don't listen or don't care. You still gotta keep up that Persona in a sense, but was still even with that like he still had some like some like really really touching and personal songs. Like don't lose me. That was a that was a very personal song Father for the very first songs on here and then came a long way that was probably like his one of the most personal songs those three right there. But but overall like I like the production I thought that you know for the majority it was upbeat. I was messing with it compared to the other two Migos projects and I think their overall like like in this is just comparing all the D'Amico's like he had the best like it was it was just no question. He definitely had the best albumin and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of songs on here and I've been listening to it ever since it came out. So so that's my take on it. How you feel about this like	1.0
1	It was it was decent decent out of the songs that I that you know, I mean out of the whole album the songs that I liked was the most was made men wild wild west and clout. Those are the songs. I like the most you already stated that cardi B. You got them on that song. She killed that shit came front. I just hope she wrote it. That's all I can say about that. Hopefully she wrote it here.	1.0
2	Ready for man or nobody else for that matter and you know, that's what they were saying.	0.0
1	I'm just saying let's not act like there's no act like it ain't you ain't true that you know allegations ain't always been out there Sion right on stuff. Yeah. I thought that that very first song that actually opening track which was I believe it was father for got really personal talk about, you know, his oldest son and all the stuff saying how you know, he was 17 when you had them and she like that I felt that shit that shit was that shit was kind of tough. Okay, and then you touched on like him, you know getting in the beef and shit like that with other rappers and stuff like that. I just seen like Snippets of the stuff with him on that Ebro and he still talking popping off his like second. I wanted to get behind them after I watch that Breakfast Club interview that he did it was like, okay, maybe he's in misunderstood. He turn right back around saying how like the you know, the older the older generation should basically should you know should thank them and shit like that. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Like come off am like we were I was rooting know the hold the Vivica Fox me my was rooting for you. That's that's how I was now. It's kind of like, I don't know FAMU just you switching up on me too much. So yeah with that being said those would have the songs that I like the most on it without no talking too much on it at that made man was hot. It was probably that was probably my favorite song at all. A made man was hot like the said the Wild Wild West Joy I'm with her. I wasn't gonna that shit was tight to and I said the cardi B Carter be stole that, you know saying she had the best verse on on the whole album to me do anything for clout? Yeah. She had the best verse on the album on the entire album with all those features Gucci. It was a lot of features to like, I think it was like 16 songs and like eight of the songs have features on them. So that's a bit much for my for my taste. I mean, you got 16 songs. I don't want to see more than like for features. Just my personal my personal preference, but that for that I'll give it a go give it a two and a half out of five. I'm gonna give it a two and a half. It was the best out of every solo project from them.	0.0
2	Okay? Okay, and I presented a question. I was like damn he got all these features are like it's offset low-key cheating compared to compared to the other Migos because they didn't have that many features or at least take off dating because quavo kind of he did have a share. Teachers as well, but I felt like Allstate had the best set of features. So I was like, yeah was he is he kind of cheating on this? Like I still thought that he had the best the best album out of the three, but the features like if you're looking at it from that perspective that the county is cheating like because it's like damn can you do any dope song by yourself, but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because I still enjoy like the majority of the songs on here.	-1.0
1	So the one of the songs I picked on it, which was I think it was made man didn't have a feature and that was so low.	-1.0
2	That was so so again my take on it from all the features that I end up liking the majority of the songs. He clearly had the best out of the Three Amigos. I'm gonna give him a 3. I'ma get my three just just based off of off of that along because I really thought especially after the delay the first delay. I was like man, I don't know about this. Like, what is he really trying to do was he trying to save face what else is really going on with it? But I think all in all once it finally came out. I thought they did was a pretty a pretty decent album and I enjoyed it for the most part for what it is the production to I forgot to mention. Yeah production will definitely good for ducks with Delphine. Good night. And obviously that would me that's you know, my biggest thing. I look at the reduction first and then like at the features on there. I'm seeing how you mesh well with the features and then you know, the lyrics come out through for me. So again, I enjoy it down man. I definitely do it. So I'm gonna give it a three. So that's our takes on it. Also Father for I I give it a 3 flight gives a two and a half. So there you go man as I'm review. Let's get to the song of the week. Now. I have to make two chains again because I don't know if you got a chance to listen to a rapper go to the league yet, but there was a particular song and let me not mess this up here give you the proper name of the song, but it had Ariana Grande on it. And it's only called rude earlier. Yeah, it's called rule the world and it had a Camry Camry sample here. I was like, whoa. I said I know this sucks. I said, what is this? I said oh, oh no, I feel like I told everybody on Twitter. I said are we gonna grind a doing uh doing a remix of why don't we fall in love and what I'm going home? He's like nah, he's I always felt that I was like, yo I said give it a chance man. Give it a chance. I'll legs actually a good song where you like. Nah, you like I'm good. But it just inspired me to like go back and listen to the Emery. So I want to we fall in love and when she came out. Oh man, I forgot like how hot she was fam. Like this song was fucking dope and shit. So I would have listened. I was like yo, this song was bumping yo, they beat was was dope as hell. So this is going to be my song for the week and that was inspiration from the from the sample remix for a router word vagina Grande en change to chase album. So Amory, why don't we fall in love? This came out in 2002 people 2002 to memory did take a long break, but she did apparently come back. I haven't even get channels in that album. Do I ain't even gonna lie, but but you did come back and start making music again, but when we first came out man, she had a bus. She definitely had a bus. So I respected that and this was definitely one of my favorite songs from her. Why don't we fall in love the find Marie Van de saint-fond is that stain?

2	Yeah, absolutely. It's just she just she just was never	1.0
1	She was better than the the bottom tier R&B artist, but she was just never looked at it that the top like the Beyonce's and stuff like that and she came out right around the time like after Leah past stuff like that. So it's like it was it was easy to get lost in that and I shuffle I suppose.	1.0
2	Yeah, and that will definitely during the time when the with 106 & Park Until rail was going on. So, I mean, that's why a lot of people knew about her including myself, but it was just so many artists that came out then so it definitely was easy like you Like you said to just just get missed throughout their Bunch, but the real recognize her that's what I'll say the real the real recognize we never forgot about you Emory. So I thought right so shot to you. Why don't we fall in love came out in 2002 and what you got for this week's vlog?	1.0

If you want to break it up we can do like in the past and then present if you want to do it like that, but I want to definitely let you take the floor on this one go ahead and when they came off some of your favorite producers anybody who inspired you anything like that now I ain't gonna wiggle wiggle wiggle	1.0
1	Everybody up just our I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot down a line real brief with it. Just all top because it's so many to name her like I can see like the I can talk on and off ever so high but I won't I was just like just be real brief just the ones I think of off top and then I'll just name a few that I feel like never get the credit. They deserve that I think is really good as well. But I'll start off you got to start off with the Fuji Quincy Jones like Quincy Jones. We talked about Quincy Jones When you talk about his Netflix, Joining, right mmm, but I like how you didn't even know that he produced no saying a lot of different stuff. Like when I was talk about the Austin Powers and it's my party and all that type of stuff. Like a lot of people didn't know about that. You know, a lot of people don't know about the Michael Jackson stuff. The Quincy Jones had his fingers in a lot of shit got though Quincy Jones our IP J. Dilla course, no saying probably my favorite of all time. Probably just the way he the way he laid laid his chops and stuff down was like some shit. Brilliance for like people still can't figure out how you did some of the city due to this day with that. Mpc2000 DJ Premier and other one 9th. Wonder who's my personal favorite right now Riza. Well, I think never gets the credit. He deserves, you know with the Wu-Tang dr. Dre, of course Timberland, if you're not if you're not aware of some of the shit that tamerlan did man like everything from Missy to live to Justin Timberlake North and Nelly Furtado like you name Timberland for someone who's the dude for real? And then I throw in Kanye now, I'll just I'll stop right there. It was a because it's just a lot of different people like I could like opt like people that don't people don't check for as much I believe that Big crib is a dope producer that people don't talk about nothing crisis who's with the soul council with 9th Wonder and I'm he don't get talked about he got some hot shit. It a lot of different people man. Not that's another one that I checked for. What about Hindus to do them? Gz beats and trap beats shorty red Shawty red on the trail. He used to do some hot shit man. Like Todo Jones was hot man. That's a lot of people Mannie Fresh. He was another one I can think of this is a lot of people mantid. You could just go on for hours talking about producer.	1.0
2	Okay? Okay. I'm going to piggyback off you. I'm not going to name the same people twice, but as everybody knows who listen to this podcast and just you know mess with Over the years for rails my absolute favorite producer of all time, but I want to add some more people jazze PHA. I think I didn't jazze PHA definitely made definitely made a lot of Jazzy Fizzles production zaytoven, even though even though I kind of criticized him a lot of times because for the longest he did not make like different sound he beats he loved using those freaking Jamaican drums and it he will not do anything else, but they Toven, he literally like me Gucci Mane's career. I'm not even gonna lie, like he may go to man's career because those be they made for him like and all those freaking mixtapes albums that he put out. They told him made that sound fam. So like they told me I had to get his respect for the new wage trap sound in ATL like without a doubt that man is freaking amazing. Who else who was want to mention Bangladesh back when he was popping Bangladesh Bangladesh definitely has some dope-ass his just blaze just Blues.	1.0
1	Just blue. Absolutely. He was another had that distinct sound and it came in. Yeah.	1.0
2	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know about that. Oh, yeah ain't going back to Burrell like therefore bar set up like that. That's that's the Pharrell sound read. The four bar setup is for Real sound who else I want to mention and why can't I remember his name now and this is kind of kind of sad.	-1.0
1	Oh, are you thinking wait think I let me shout out Pete Rock to I forgot to mention Pete Rock man. I don't want to my cousin a killed me if I didn't say.	-1.0
2	Pete Rock true true Metro Boomin shout out the st. Louis Metro Boomin. Definitely. He was part of the the new age sound as well like the the current sound and also want to throw in Tyler the Creator. I think he's very underrated as an as a producer but he's definitely one of my favorites today as long as he's still making music. I just met my best results and I messed with this new sound. He definitely evolved a lot. So those are just so many people that I want to mention. It's definitely a lot more but To the one that I just wanted to to mention besides but the people to flock are you mentioned so it's a lot of good producers man. I just want to say that a lot of good producers back back in the day and and up until today. I know everybody's like looking for the new sound and I guess like right now you say like Pierre Pierre born. This is one of the people who has a lot of sounds that a lot of people emulate take Keith. I feel like he he does a lot of frickin Beast that sound the same to he's finally trying to expand but he would definitely do a lot of a lot of bees that sounded the exact same and I was like what the hell is is but a lot of you trying to lay his stuff. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's as far as well. I can think of right now, but but she also produces man because like I said everyone for y'all, I really think that a lot of these people would sound pretty wack in my opinion a lot of influences our name that man.	1.0
1	Yeah out of influence will definitely like it all out. Always a fan will be you know, a mob in my production and shit. So that's why a lot of those are that I name was like sample-based you just you just admire what they do now the Metro Boomin to that I heard you mention him earlier. I like his work to that. That won't forget that joint with him and Big Sean, you know, I still be bumping that shit. Oh, yeah. That's my shirt.	1.0
