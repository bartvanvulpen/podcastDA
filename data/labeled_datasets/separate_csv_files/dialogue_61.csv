We've had a blast doing these and we're just having fun sharing ideas and getting your feedback. So thank you to all of you who are listening and sharing them out. We appreciate it.	1.0
2	So today we're going to talk about a subject the subject of kindness we I know that you know as teachers we are hopefully modeling kindness and our classroom kindness on the playground kindless with our peers kindness with their peers because the students the students are looking at you they're noticing you they're watching you and so I was reading an article the other day and found not an unsurprising but it's still a little bit of alarming statistics about what teachers are seeing in their classroom teachers are reporting about a 30% increase in bullying or unkind Behavior being displayed over the last couple of years. It's not surprising but it's still alarming. I think it's not surprising because we are seeing more bullying type of behavior or unkind Behavior through different types of social media channels the way people interact with each other and so students are noticing children are noticing what they're seeing and it's coming back into our classroom. So I thought today would be a great time to talk about kind. This how we how do we Foster kindness in her classroom? And Adam is first of all, one of the kindest people. I know I'm not just saying that because he's staring at me like I totally feel that way and if you've met him before I know that you agree, but he also does some really specific things in his classroom to help Foster that kindness and so I thought maybe Adam you could speak to that.	1.0
1	Well, yeah then thank you for that. I you know, I'm I don't know how to respond to that. I appreciate that more than you know, don't get me wrong. I have my share of demons. My closet as well and there are people who know that I can I'm a big believer in in sharing your feelings regardless of what because that's how people get to know you. So yes, I try to be the kindest person possible and I hope that I am especially with students. I always am but let's be honest. We all have our moments right? I definitely want to wear my heart on my sleeve. That's why I have a tattoo of a heart stone on my wrist because I do but no, I really appreciate that more than you know, and and I can't take total credit for For my I guess philosophy or attitude or just believe on this subject it stemmed from well. First of all, my upbringing I was raised by the best parents in the world and completely always surrounded by Family transition that to school. I had some of the best teachers in the world. I was lucky enough to go to a very very small school. So everybody knew everybody, you know your teachers Knew by first middle and last name then your family. I was raised in a kind World, which I think a lot of people our age were and unfortunately, Times have changed like you said times are changing and times are changing in and I'm a big believer that no one was was inherently born as an unkind human being it's something you're taught. It's something that you've experienced. It's what you were surrounded by on a daily basis and my goal. Our goal is to Decatur's should be to reverse that statistics and get it back to you know, I don't know just get the world to be one happy place. I know that sounds so cliche and and cool, but Then moving forward I guess to go back into my philosophy. And reason for this stemmed from a woman who was my mentor teacher and I know I've told this story before on multiple platforms and media devices and want to hear it again.	1.0
2	I wanna hear it again.	0.0
1	It's something I never get sick of telling because because I love this lady with all my heart. So when I started teaching I moved two and a half hours away from home. I knew like obviously my wife's family. That's but that's all I knew up here. I didn't know any teachers. I know nothing about the school Trish and I I moved to a town near her hometown. So we were near her family and I started this job at an amazing team that took me in there under their wings and we just we got along super great and we just had a blast together. And at the time we were a team of three teachers and I kept hearing these stories about this teacher who was now in the junior high level. Her name was honor Trotter and she had taught kindergarten. Actually. My room was her kindergarten room before I came and I got to know honor a little bit over the first couple years of teaching because she was doing A junior high like I don't science work, but she's also doing reading Specialists work on our end. So my kids got to go see her every now and then and I just I would spend my break. I know that seems like a weird word and education so we don't really get those but my break with my students would actually get time as a class to go see honor in Reading tight like that await a specific dedicated reading block that she got to take kids and do awesome activities. I found myself not taking a break but sitting and watching her and I was amazed at the way this woman taught and II guess our school didn't really have an official Mentor program at the time but I considered her my mentor because I learned more from her than I ever did from any textbook or any course I ever took and it it wasn't just about teaching it was just about the way she interacted with with not just students but human beings and I use that term a lot when I go out and speak that we need to treat these people in our classrooms and our lives not as students that are walking through a door. But his people is anybody else wants to be treated, you know, so I learned a lot from her on that subject and then When she was close to retirement, she actually came back to kindergarten she joined our kindergarten because our numbers were growing and she went to our board and our Administration said listen. I know you're going to be hiring kindergarten. Please. Let me finish up my career there where I started and of course they were like, yeah, let's do it. So I want to say I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but maybe the last five six seven years of her career were spent in kindergarten and I got to be a part of her team. It was it was awesome. We were team before for a while then a team of five them sema4 went back and forth, but it was always Myself, my neighbor Tiffany and Lori who were my three what I started and then honor it was always the four of us plus another 1 or minus another one and honored just to just was just an awesome person in the working with and getting to learn from her and then two years before she was about to retire. She was kind of forced into early retirement because she was diagnosed with cancer that forced her to stop teacher Chic. She had to take care of herself as she was weakening. She only made it about nine months. After she was diagnosed and I'll never forget when she called me up one day. I still remember I was laying on my couch watching a movie phone rings. It was like a Saturday and it was her and she was he come over for a minute and she lived like a half hour from where I live. So it's like yeah. Yeah, like what what's up, you know and my daughter was I think to at the time so she was probably napping and I just looked at Trisha. I'm like I need to go to honors house and she's like for what it's like I really don't know and I knew that she had been out and having some medical issues. I didn't know that it was going to be big and she sits me down a couch and tells me that she has cancer and of course as anybody would I lost it I started crying and I didn't know what to think and she didn't shed a tear. She's smiling at me and I looked at him like what are you doing? Like, how are you know said she goes she goes I've cried out of my I cried when I got the diagnosis, but she goes I've learned to accept the fact that there's a reason that I have cancer and and how it blew my mind. I mean, I probably jaw dropped look they're like, what do you mean there's a reason like no, there's no For a reason for this and she truly was the most hopeful person in the world. She believed that there was a purpose to her being diagnosed with cancer and I know the stories going on. I apologize for rambling but there's a point to this there really is. So I guess the point this is that that there was never specific lesson from her that she came out and said this is the way you should be treating people or here's a lesson on kindness or here's a lesson on bullying or is she there was never a specific thing that I recall a my mind at all it started with that moment when she Said to me there's a purpose for this and at that time I had no idea that it was becoming it was I had no idea. I mean no one thought she's gonna pass away as fast. She did we just we didn't really know and then when we lost honor we never got to find out what she thought her purpose was, right? So honored passed away nine months after diagnosis, May 6th of 2013 and the week after her funeral or that actually three days after she passed away was her birthday birthday is May 9th and on that day our entire Will went out back and we bought I don't remember how much I think we bought 60 because it was gonna be on her 60th birthday on May 9th. We bought 60 yellow balloons and released them one of our past PE teachers who had taught With Honor for 30 plus years brought little yellow bracelets to the school for everyone like rubber bracelets, you know that said honoring Honor on them. She given to every student staff member like thousands of these bracelets were headed out and I just remember being out on this lawn with our entire School telling stories of her microphone. Everybody got to kind of share their story about honor that was close to her. We sang Happy Birthday. We let these balloons go and and something about that day and the I don't have image the balloons were yellow honors favorite color was yellow. So that's the reason for the yellow balloons the yellow bracelet. She just loved the color yellow and that day became an image. I guess that was etched into our school forever now because it's continued but so fast forward again, and that year went on we all made it. Through the school year a new year started and then things started to seem kind of weird as they would if you lost, you know a family member best friend are our building just didn't seem the same we knew she was still there, but we can still hear her laugh in the hallway. We knew she was there but something struck me as something I guess important in the fact that I needed to find a way or we as a team or a teacher group or a school need to find a way to keep her alive in our building as much as possible and to do that on my end. I mean, we've all done our own share of things of sharing her story of an item. High-end, I wrote a book about her and it was a book called yellow that Shameless plug here. You can find on Amazon or you know, you don't have to buy my book. You can go to my YouTube channel teachers learn to dot common and see a free video of me reading it to your class. So check that out. But anyway, I wrote this book as a way to keep her alive because I felt there were so many students and staff cheated out of getting to know her and I felt lucky that I got to write. So I wrote this book. I got to start traveling around to schools as an author of all things which Blew my mind because I just wrote this just for her, you know sharing honor story. And the reason that was brought up was because her story was all about just making people happy and there's a line on the book that says Honor made people's gray skies into yellow Skies or turn people's gray skies and yellow skies because that's what she did and it wasn't. I mean, I know there's so many kindness campaigns out there then they're all great, but hers wasn't about doing anything for anyone. It wasn't about doing a random act of kindness. It was more so that she got people to realize the good in. Side themselves just like being the person she was and I know that sounds kind of confusing but I don't know how she did it. But she made you feel like the best person in her life. No matter what it was and she just found a way to make everybody smile and make you very happy. Yeah, and that's the kind of kindness that she spread was just getting other people to feel good. It wasn't going out of her way to do anything. She was just that type of human being she made everybody feel special special. Yeah an important and noticed, you know, And she made you feel good about yourself. She brought out something in me that I don't know. I'd ever experienced before you know, so I keep saying this but fast forward again and I think three or four years after she had passed away we decided to keep her birthday celebration going but even more and Anna term had come up from my book called make someone's day yellow and we just kept using that over and over again in our building would skip say to make someone's day LSA make someone's day yellow today rather than saying like pay it forward. We just said make someone's day yellow And we decided to do that. So we on May 9th three years ago, four years ago. Whatever. The first one was. We decided to celebrate honors birthday at our school with what we call Yellow day and we did just kind things all day long. We decorate our entire school to look yellow. I mean balloons streamers posters. Everything was turned yellow we did do random acts of kindness for people around the building. So we delivered like flowers to the secretaries and just rope notes to teachers and random people saying smile today are hope you have the best day ever. Or thank you for being you just things that honor would have done without really knowing them we decided to do purposefully, right and after it happened after yellow to happen. I videoed the whole thing. I put on my YouTube channel and about two weeks after the day. I got a message from a teacher and I look at the location. It was from Australia, and it blew my mind that someone lost really was even watching my little YouTube channel, right? I looked at the comment and said thank you for sharing this message. We're going to try to do a yellow day at our school and I I remember running to school the next day like oh my gosh you guys check this out someone in Australia is going to do our celebration like it's going to spread and then these emails and messages started coming in at one after another after another after another and and over the past three years of doing yellow day at our building and then spreading around other schools and other states and other countries we've hit I think eight different countries where we've seen yellow Day celebrated and 35 different states within the u.s. I can't count the number of schools that it's reached. The number of people it's reached but yellow day has become a movement is what we've used the term as As you know and going back to an honor was diagnosed and what this all meant. I truly believe that everything that happens in your life is done for a purpose whether you want to believe in a higher being or not or what your beliefs are. It doesn't matter to me. Everything happens for a reason. Let's not deny that fact there's a reason behind everything that happens and I never forget two years ago on the other day when it was really getting big and blowing up. We were getting messages from schools left and right and people post on social media like picture after picture after picture after picture. A bunch of us teachers were standing outside my classroom door talking and showing sharing images of images that we were tagged in after school. And one of our first grade teachers Donna walks by and she goes this is it Adam and I said, excuse me, and she is this is the purpose and I said, what do you mean and she goes this is why honor had cancer and I lost it like a probabilistic. I lost it. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's true. Like we never got to find out what honor believed her purpose for having cancer was until that day and we truly feel like her reason for being diagnosed.	1.0
2	Know'st was to start this movement and get people to realize the good another people and when there's one there are these horrible events that happen whether it happens to a person it happens to a building and happens to an area. It's hard to to see at the moment what that you know, where the good can come from it right? It's hard to see that because it just feels so awful. But I think that I think that what you're saying is we have to Look for look for the positive that can come from it. Even how painful that is. Look for that positive and then and take action as a result of what you see that that is DD an awesome way to say it and an awesome.	1.0
1	I'd recognize it and had I had you as a friend back then maybe I would have realized that I don't think any one of us really felt like we were doing anything for that. We just wanted to keep her memory alive, you know, kind of organically happened it did and luckily. We proudly it spread to what it has today.	1.0
2	I'm like still crying over the story. So if you do this, that's just me, you know being a worse but it's just um, it's a varied it's an extremely touching story and it is painful when you lose a staff member. So I'm thinking of so you have this yellow day and and you have this celebration of her life in May but leaving up to that time. What? Some of the things that you incorporate into your day into your way of interacting with your human beings, right one of the things that I'll share mine first and then maybe you could share something that you do is this is a really challenging thing to do. It's surprisingly challenging but as you go about your day and you run into 7-Eleven for your you know Snicker bar, not that that happened to me. I'm just saying, you know, I go in there for nothing but healthy things but you run into 7-Eleven. You and you grab something and you're checking out right? Look that person in the eye. It's really hard. It's a hard habit to get into and when they say, how are you how's your day? You know oftentimes your think I got to swipe my card. There's people behind me and I got to kind of find the right change, but we get in the habit of not looking at people when we talk to them or when we're in front of them. And and when that happens, I mean, I just think it becomes we become more disconnected. Even though we're surrounded by people. And so I think that one thing that can help is to become connected. So it's a habit. I'm trying to get better at and I have you know it Ebbs and flows like sometimes I'm better at it than others, but I noticed that I remember back going back to 9/11. So y'all, you know, I've been on this planet a long time some of you are like, oh, yeah, I was too and that happened. I remember when that happened and it was a very strange. couple of weeks strange and that you know one we didn't see our planes in the sky for a couple of days, but then when you would pass random strangers, I'm going to cry thinking about this but um, I'm getting it together here when you were passed random strangers on the street. They would look you in the eye and smile and and greet you which is very it's very different. If you're in a small town happens all the time. If you're in a large city doesn't happen ever like never nobody talks to you. I mean, you just kind of go about your day or base having their little mental conversations and they're going about their day. But for those two weeks we were connected and we were a kind. derp	1.0
1	Cry it out because you're right. It's unfortunate that it took something like that. Yeah right to make us realize how do I don't know to bring that out of people.	1.0
2	I don't know and I did it and I think that that Catalyst we never want to have that happen again, you know, we never want that to happen again, but I think we have to take that message of how we felt by connecting with people. I'm still crying y'all. And I'm going to make you talk now, but all right, but how we felt and bring that to our classroom. So as your students are coming in, you know greet. I know this is people say all the time but greeting them and then looking them in the eye those are kind of two different things. And so when you combine those two things is pretty powerful. Okay. I'm going to get my act together you talk now? Okay.	-1.0
1	All right now and I'm so glad you mentioned that because this is something that not only we need to be doing with our students, but we need to be teaching to our students. That looking people in the eye and saying hello Yeah, and it's amazing to me how much that effect can have on someone and I'm probably overly do this. I probably had annoyed the heck out of people a big city because I do now that I've got the travel a lot more with my career in education the way it is now like I go to DC quite a bit I go to I was in New Orleans last week I go to some big cities, right? I make a point no matter where I'm at to to look at people and say hello, and I know that one. Our parents have told us like all the time don't talk to strangers. Don't talk to me. But why not? You know, I'm not saying go get in a conversation with someone and tell them everything about your life. But when you're walking past them on the street. Hello. Hi. How's it going? How are you? You know I say hi to every single random person I passed and I get some really dirty looks I get the shaking of the head. Like, why are you talking to me? But why not? You know, why not just say hello. I mean, it's a simple simple thing when you're walking through a Lobby of a hotel Or when you I don't know. I know it seems like it should go without saying right but the do it and I get that this is educated for reached out to you here and obviously we sincerely hope you're doing that your students every day. I know all you amazing educators are saying hello to your students when they come in every day. That's that should go without saying but teach that to them why not teach your students to start doing that around the building for starters, you know instead of don't tell them to go out and just talk to every stranger they meet but say hello to every single person that passes them in the hallway or or on the playground or at lunch or in the office or on the bus hallway, cause there's no talking in the hallway screwed.	1.0
2	I know what you're saying. I mean you are you know, and as teachers, you know, we can also model this and obviously honor did and I'm sure you are as well. But as we are walking in the hall and we see up here, you know make eye contact and smile and say good morning or good afternoon or or something like that. I think that you know, I I know that you know, I've been in a lot of schools to where you know, you have teachers to get together and you know, when you get a group of girls together, sometimes sometimes we're not so nice and but sometimes you know, you see this kind of get-together chat chat chat or a teacher will be having the students come in and another teacher will join in and ask a question. And then meanwhile, there's interaction students are watching that so if we are if we were showing kindness to whoever is here, or if that conversation is anything less than kind about maybe a little gossip going on right students are noticing this so Be the person you want to see in your classroom. And of course, there's all types of great books out there on kindness and being paying it forward and you know being a good human. So those are things that we're going to want to incorporate in our classroom, but I think reading the books and checking that off. The list is not enough right? It's not enough to show, you know, the person that we want to	1.0
1	Be alright, it's being it's been an example to indict and just letting your students watch you WEA know wholeheartedly these kids mimic every single thing we do. So imagine if if you smiled and said hello to every person across your path, you know, we talked to think in one of the previous episodes about getting kids to to learn the names of other staff members, right? And I mean, that's something that could be considered a kind act when you can call someone by name rather than just just waving or giving a head nod, you know, so that's a simple step. Inclusion is another big one and I don't mean on the the classroom inclusion of you know, different grade levels and abilities and it just including people in your everyday conversations. I just think that's an important lesson we can teach to all kids that we include people who might not feel included you'll see that in bullying statistics all the time. What if you know, what if what if what if one person had someone sit with him at lunch or that one person that someone sits on the playground so kindness as a whole can be stretched in Seoul The different directions and so many philosophies and so many ideas or things but it doesn't have to be the purchase of an item or an idea that your intently doing. It just just just be a good human being, you know, the way that the way that you would want to be treated, right?	1.0
2	I agree. I agree. I mean looking back at you know, my life just long so far, but when I look back in my life, you know, I know there's times when I wasn't the best person I could be you know, and any and those those moments, you know, if you know, you can't redo them, you know, there's times when I have been unkind I have either verbally been unkind or I've mentally been unkind and both of those things are you know things as humans, we you know, we got to deal with we got to recognize it but hopefully learn from it as well. And so, you know as we notice unkind things because it's going to happen in the classroom. We're Notice on kind things. Hopefully, that's the takeaway that students can can learn as yes, you know, this happened and and showing them how that's not the person they're going to want to grow up to be right. That's not the person and and when they can look at you you teachers out there and see that person who they're going to want to walk in your footsteps and hopefully that's the takeaway from today's episode.	1.0
1	Yeah. And I know you mentioned like there are things we can start doing now and that's really it just just beat that example. I do want to say as we gear up towards yellow days not until May right but Deedee you said it best like why wait till then start some things now and I think we've covered quite a few things my favorite part about this kind of talk to is that when I do this talk or this this conversation as a keynote when I go out and speak to schools. My favorite part is just seeing people now their heads, you know, like yeah. Yeah, that's a great act. Like I already do that and that sincerely that's my hope that These are things people are already doing maybe that's just reignites your idea that come across has try that or maybe I can do this for my students know really busy in the classroom.	1.0
2	We think of all the things we need to do and you know it, you know, like my resting face is not a good one. I'm just going to say right so I mean being aware of that or my thinking face know I'd had students got missiles. Are you mad I'm like no. I'm just thinking, you know, but it looks like a mat that is all looks the same sometimes but you know, we just be kind of aware of that we But we have a big to-do list as teachers, but I think at the top of that list should be make really good human beings.	1.0
1	I like that. Yeah, so we have a website going make someone's day yellow.com some of Didi and eyes amazing friends have shared some free products out there that on that site that you don't need to wait until yellow data use, they're just ideas about Sharing kindness and creating kind atmospheres in your classroom, I guess and just making the again. This is just about making the world a brighter place for other people. And by getting people to see the good inside themselves. So check that out and the best part about this is I've learned so many wonderful ideas from people like DeDe and another teachers who have come back and said, well we did this for the other day. We did this real day. We're doing this to gear up for you today. So, please please please as you share it this episode or share talk about this with your teachers share those ideas with us, you know, if you put something about kindness on social media that is related to to making the world brighter tag Didi and I in it and we want to hear your ideas to in. Yes, yellow day. Obviously, it's not my personal ID at all. It was it was a team idea that we started at our school. Obviously the books are my ID. And what I've done with the so far has been a culmination of ideas. I've learned from people. So yes while it's tied back to my name. I guess I don't want it to be that way at all. I want it to be a worldwide Global thing. So ours right is it's ours and I want those ideas to be spread and shared. So we love I say we because it is a community people that work this together. We love Of hearing ideas of ways to make make the world a brighter Place awesome.	1.0
2	Awesome. That's a good spot to end.	1.0
