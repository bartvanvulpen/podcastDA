We release a new episode every week. So please hit that subscribe button leave us a rating and share this with your fire family and friends now onto this week's episode. Where as always we ask the question. Are you DTF? Hello and welcome to the volunteer firefighter podcast. My name is Carl and tonight. I got pretty much an empty podcast room. I do have Scott. Oh Todd. Thanks getting the top and I have Scott. Hey and I are tan. Hello and yeah projects. Yes anymore. Is it is it true? And it's just you're here. There is a little bit of a break and we're going to have Kevin robbed, but I think careful was too. Tired and Rob go well, we are absolutely probably sent to Australia. So when we buy it for a while, but yeah, it's got some news a tractor-trailer.	0.0
3	Unfortunately, Robin Mexico watching the kids. I like Rob. Yeah, so Marshall bass drum Australia, he got back to us and send us a message to this mystery today with some updated numbers. So they're now at 2 million hectares of land burnt in their Wildfire season.	-1.0
2	I don't know I sound insanely huge.	1.0
3	I'm not sure how big but you said no because that's really yeah.	-1.0
1	He said in the message. I think he was he was on Mutual Aid tonight for a fire coming in from the south and then they were watching for a fire that was already coming in from the north. It's surrounded by fire.	-1.0
3	So at least Yeah. Yeah, there's a Sting from New South Wales rural fire service that he sent us says 73 300 grass fires Burning Brightly burning 2 million hectares of land burnt 673 homes or have been destroyed 14 either 1400 other buildings have been destroyed in six human lives being lost.	-1.0
1	So I don't know when that was made in a for that much to be burden to only have lost six people so far. I mean, yeah, six people still six people but for that much to burn and still have only six losses so far bus, it's crazy and they get pretty violent fires pretty quickly down there.	-1.0
3	So why don't you told us about exploding eucalyptus trees and yeah, yeah.	-1.0
1	Yeah. Did you hear that episode with them tell ya He's he's talking about with the trees just like yeah, the tree gets on fire and then it explodes in and there's like eucalyptus oil everywhere not because he said the only way it's going to go well with his fifty fifty millimeters of rain, which they don't get very often.	-1.0
3	Yeah see with least with us. We know it's gonna eventually get cold like it is right now eventually the fires are gonna go out come October September October. We know no matter how big the fire is going to eventually die off, you know might rekindle.	-1.0
1	Doing it with Summer again, but exactly and it's actually safe to travel around Australia when there's no fire units will be killed by snakes and spiders and everything will kill you they're coming to whether or not it was going to Australia and then my uncle Kev, that's really. Not this week, but he sent me a picture of a spider that was in the corner of his house. And then I just I vowed never to even go there laughs let alone limp there as I know. You're fine. Yeah. Yeah, I'll stay. I'll stay here. Yeah, so we hope and wish and thoughts and everything else are going out to all the people that are heading over there and helping them out and everyone that's already there doing their job and everybody is obviously going through the hassles and the struggles of having to deal with this stuff as well. Stay safe. Tonight we are going to be talking about about Narcan. So Todd you were in I think two weeks ago and you did a Narcan course for the boys, right? We did.	-1.0
2	Yeah, I felt like pretty good. We had a pretty good crew in the in the hall. Yeah. It's a big thing that I've been working in. My normal job. A lot is a lot of Education and Training people on the locks own and just changing a lot of the stigmas and the Misinformation out there voted as well because everything is a miracle drug and and you know, there's lots of things that people are ingesting and so are smoking or or injecting and in our locks on will not actually reduce or reverse those effects with more people think that if somebody takes something and they've overdose that naloxone is the golden ticket is not so lots of good information with that.	0.0
3	So the locks is actually the drawer Ugh, but in Arkansas The Branding, yeah, there's a brand brand name versus the is there a is there another form of Martin Nowak some is there like Lotto know like is there any like so there's our can which is a kind of a loser than another Milwaukee that you could buy I don't know action is the one that I've ever been exposed to.	0.0
2	Yeah.	1.0
3	It kind of looks like no loss is a drunkard. Yeah. Yeah.	-1.0
2	Yeah. Yeah, I can answer that.	1.0
1	Not sure so what so maybe just run? Through a little bit on what you taught us in the training.	0.0
2	So basically the all the kids that we have that we hand out that general public get there's ampules point 4 mils per milliliter of Apple of the naloxone in the kits and there's three samples per kit with three syringes and there's also nasal atomizer naloxone that people get handed out as well majority of the law enforcement's usually have those There are four milligrams. They work pretty well. However, the majority of the ones that are handed out are all the inter muscular injectable injectable kits. So those ones that we talked about are just wanted to really expose everybody on what's in the kit how to properly use it then we talked a lot about how to actually recognize and respond to an opiate overdose. And we talked about some of the myths of of the overdose responses as well. So this is just for us. Nervous system depressants from opiates specifically and not certain certain stimulants.	-1.0
3	All right, I think one of the biggest things that you so much stuff that I took from that was the fact that it's not all about just like certain people certain lifestyle. Yeah, definitely because I know some of our like summer guys were like, why are we where are we learning a essentially help with drug addict?	1.0
2	Exactly.	1.0
3	It would not only because everybody's in human we should be helping them but also so because things you were saying about it could there's so many varieties.	0.0
2	So there's the typical what people see in the media right that people living on the street that are using hardcore drugs. That's what is all of the TV. So that's what people think that that's where the crisis is, but it's anywhere from The Accidental overdoses from people or first-time users sharing a pill Young. Is trying to get high first first time sharing a fake Dilaudid or something and they accidentally overdose versus just a an elderly patient who may have certain morphine or Dilaudid on board as well other pain medications if they accidentally take too much that still isn't stolen overdose. And if you have a kid, you could still use that to help them come out of it. You have there's there's so many facets to to being able to respond to an emergency and there's could be totally though just those accidental overdoses fentanyl now is in everything. Some people are putting it in in cigarettes and selling them as Cocoa Puffs. So they think it's cocaine mixed in with the tobacco. However, it's actually fentanyl it's fennel. So cheap, right? So they gets caught with everything we're seeing in our area now with one of the the team's I On we're seeing friend all in everything. We're seeing in crystal meth we're seeing in cocaine. We're seeing it in marijuana. So people are just lazy it with it. So you never know what you're getting. So people always argue with us say, oh, it's I get it from my normal guy fickle that street pharmacist. Sorry. It's not gonna be it's not gonna be as as good or as pure as you said, you never know the consistency of it. So when you Consistency. I always go back to one story of you know, two people they want to split a pill they break it in half. The one person takes it he over also the other person takes the other half. He's not going to overdose and the reason is because it's there's no consistency that you can't you can't mix it super well, like I always describe taking a handful of salt throwing it on table take a pinch of salt and so the color Sprinkle it over that and you're going to see a random assortment of different colors specs in nicer cutting that up into piles that one pile might have two specs three specs for aspects that other pile might only had one Speck and depending on where that spec gets put on your side of the pill or whatever wherever you're smoking or injecting. You don't know the consistency of it. So that's why some people overdose harder and go down while harder than others when you you took a picture of	-1.0
3	Was it heroin or cocaine?	0.0
2	Oh those three yes, three finger and vials with yeah, some different levels of drugs. We had to know there's you know, like the one with the heroin fentanyl car fentanyl.	-1.0
3	Yeah, which is there one was like you didn't even were able to make the practice where you so the heroin was with her. Yeah. It was like there's a lot of fair My Heroine in this file and it was the was like how much they hire how much to be lethal was that was that picture?	-1.0
1	Well, That was just talking with a lethal dose alike.	-1.0
2	So late as a good visual the show like like let's say a quarter mil in a vial of powder of heroin could be a weird lethal dose and then it showed a vial of Fentanyl and it was only a couple of specs like candy or something - well, there's like one or two little specks in it. So it just goes to show you the volume of how much stronger is because people always here at stake. It's a hundred times stronger than morphine is hundred strong kind of the Fentanyl and then car fennel is another a hundred times stronger, right?	-1.0
3	So yeah, that's a good visual people like seeing that so it's like yeah, maybe that's what a lot of people a lot of our guys stuck with them because you know, it gives them something because I think people think oh, it's still still a lot of fentanyl you need. No, it's like basically the salt like a little very small amount.	-1.0
2	It's insanely strong. Yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah. I think I was listening to and I mentioned you guys that she the on Joe Rogan November 7th episode 1379 there was Investigative journalist, his name was Ben Westhoff, and he wrote a book called fentanyl Inc. How Rogue chemists are creating the deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic and he just talks about it like him when he went to you goes to China and it's like the drug dealers are kind of making this stuff and I cheap it is to get hold of this stuff. Right? It's insane which is why everyone's cutting it with cutting it into everything. It's just it's a quick easy boost. I think he said something like it's just like 50 times. Stronger than heroin so to Rice grains of it basically can can absolutely decimate it like insanity episode 2 listening to you.	-1.0
3	Can you explain - on what is it doing it? Like it makes it basically shuts them down. So they stop breathing right because it was right.	-1.0
2	So so opiates there are several nervous system depressant. So people think they called an overdose emergency by this actually respiratory emergency like it's going to decrease your Drive so much. You're going to be very slow respirations to know respirations. So when we talk about signs and symptoms, those are a lot of the signs that we looked at. We looked at what's their breathing rate is going to be like eight respirations and minute or less or not reading at all. Now they're going to be signed on if it'll be blue in the lips pale blue. The fingertips could be very sweaty or die Frederick it go to be little bit of vomitus or foam in there are way as well and then the pinpoint people sort of are the other tell Tale sign right there is what some crews are seeing now. They're seeing some other drugs on board that are really they're still keeping them depressed. So we're giving them the locks on and it's knocking off the little bits off of your opiate receptors and blocking it appropriately where it should be but the people are still saying depressed from another drug on board so I can benzodiazepines and other things like that. So, What what we're seeing now with that is that still that respiratory emergency like you we can't forget that we need to breathe for these people on all oxygenate them and then transport them. So in our back to our kits and suffering of that were teaching is we follow this the save me campaign so stands for stimulate Airway ventilate evaluate your medication and then evaluate again, so we want to stimulate try and get them. Awake painful stimulation see if they respond at all. They don't respond. Then we go into the airway. So we're opening their Airway. Then we're going to be ventilating because it's that central nervous system depressant is depressing their respiratory drive and we want to auction auction them and breathe for them. We want to breathe one breath every five seconds for them and we can keep them alive and keep them sustained by breathing for them without even giving them logs on fruit and then after that then I'll give more value eight if there's no real response and we get into her medication and then at that point we will be administering your first story dose of point for intramuscular. So we taught everybody had a breakdown feels drawn up properly and landmark throw it in a few other Miss like that people think need to expose the scan. You can't you can go right through the clothing if you have to sew in the deltoid or the thighs the best spot as well.	-1.0
3	I think some of our some people are afraid to give a needle because they you know, they're afraid it is the old unit given are putting air bubble and then and yeah and of them and they're going to have some of you may die from stroke or an air embolism exactly.	-1.0
1	So it's it's safe.	1.0
2	Like I always tell people, you know, when you hold that syringe back up, you can see the are in just slowly push the plunger of the syringe up until that are is gone. You don't need to see in the movie spurting out of the syringe because we're not wasting our naloxone, you know, just until that are is out and if there is still Mariner totally fine. It's not gonna do anything to you. It's like said it's not like the movies.	0.0
3	It's not going to completely stop your heart disease because he's an intramuscular that's mainly is gas into Moscow.	-1.0
2	How many are our bodies will absorb even a fair amount of error intravenously as well.	-1.0
3	Yeah. Yeah. I was talking one of the other paramedics in the one who's saying. Yeah, you said it will like the earthing.	0.0
2	Yeah one air bubble when everybody was going to kill you you'd be dead in the hospital.	-1.0
1	Is that happen? Yeah, so it's good. It's so we had lots of training IP.	1.0
2	As for people to practice and draw that up because it is a it is a fine motor skills hard for a lot of people to figure it out and people notice first time they met me you handled the syringe, right? So they would need to practice with it and learn how to use it draw it out. Because in that in that moment people panic people forget to eventually the forget all the other little stuff that is started grabbing that that kit and start drawing it up which at the end of the day is good you're getting it in but we need to ventilate these people up there gonna be brain-dead afterwards. Otherwise, we need to we need to get that option in them and we injected	-1.0
1	- yeah, I heard you killed a bunch of hard. Yeah. Yeah, but did you see we're just so I guess you know, it's another one of those things that know especially I know that we're starting to carry them on on truck now right for yeah.	-1.0
3	Well Todd was good enough to give us one for each truck Victor got put in appropriately. So we were in have those now and like we had said it's not necessarily. I mean, we're not our guys aren't popping pills and there and you know, we're not we're not currently attending these. Because the video games is still going but you get the secondary exposures, which way is he really talking about.	0.0
2	Yeah, and that's one thing we did. I mean that's why we put them on our trucks initially as well as is. Yes. Anybody can be trained to use this cat like there is young children that know how to use these kits and can can administrate them. However, you know for us responding we needed a plan. We need an operational guideline for a second as Bowser for us because I've seen it numerous First I'm the and I'm sure many other people have is where you're either in a residence or your Patty somebody down or you're trying to get them into the back of the ambulance or it's in a car accident where there's a lot of paraphernalia left over or sitting close to them. So if you get exposed to that and we need a plan for our size, so if we're not carrying it, we're not prepared then if we come across something and we need to administer it it's still there for us and you're totally covered under the Good Samaritan. I can be see anyways.	-1.0
1	Okay, yeah. Let's go. So yeah, I mean now now we've got them on the trucks against another one of those tools in the toolbox ready to use when you need them an important tool obviously, like you said, especially for secondary exposures, especially in MV eyes. You never know what you're rolling up on when you're opening those doors and I think we spoke about that before especially with the RZ masks actually as well. Yeah, they're good a set of four orphans.	1.0
3	I'm sorry mask on I don't know one of the are our time. So so areas was the drug 100 the car that we did that one.	-1.0
1	Yeah.	1.0
3	Yeah you were I see on Denim and then yeah, I'm using right away like yeah, he had a baggy on the - yeah, because scenario was you know, we're in a parking lot of these people are just kind of passed out like there's no signs of accent or anything Todd see this. Sorry that guy he see right away is like are you thinking it's some sort of a OD course, there's three people in the car and none of them were responsive really and one of them may be in the back. Is still someone at the Atlantic and yeah right away. We open the doors. He said I'm putting on masks everything like that. And then he's got me looking for any drug paraphernalia and we have found some white powder in the front. The best board has treated it like that. So it was it was good to see that scenario worked in to do that that sort of event now go get you thinking about it.	1.0
2	Right like you need to because we need to take responsibility of that scene and you know in our areas if we don't have law enforcement there right away, you know, we need to be aware of how to handle it just enough to make it safe so we can work around it and then leave it alone. Like I'm telling people that No transferred into a Ziploc bag and things like that and put in your pocket to handle the police later. But yeah people need to be aware of secondary suppose for that type stuff for sure.	0.0
3	Right? I mean, there's been a few tacos few the law enforcement geysers. They've had some wrestling matches with guys, you know, and they are there in there in there cell block or there are there on the street, you know, they're they're taking a person down to Cuff them to rest them in the next thing they finding out why powder all over them because they this guy's been trying to hide his drugs so that They've been exposed a few of actually went down with exposure. So that's why they get there. That's why both some carry that like you were saying they carry the the nasal atomizer.	0.0
1	Yeah.	1.0
2	Yeah, and those just talked about those real quick to those are four milligrams generally and the reason being for that is, you know, it's a One-Shot dose and the in the Nares and the way it's absorbed and you can lose so much out of that nostril as well not just on placement and everything. So that's why it's a Larger dose for that because people always worry about what's going to be too much of a loading dose. What if they come up out of withdrawals or or not, but it's there's so many aspects to that of how well it gets placed to when you administer it to how much runs out the absorption rate the work. So right.	-1.0
3	So one thing we hear about is the yeah, we can come up. Yeah, but they come up if you love them too much, but she's fast.	1.0
1	I guess well the big thing I mean we want to bring them up slowly, but we want to	1.0
2	Section 8 and ventilate these people because when they're coming up there's a very misconception that people are hammering with the locks on and they come up swing and they're just fighting. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they're probably fighting but they're hypoxic. They're you know, they're not thinking straight some of them. Yes, they come up you can kick them in withdrawals. If you give too much of a dough. So we generally start with point four point eight than one milligram, etc. Etc. But yeah, we don't like to hammer him right away with one two milligrams immediately because you can cook them. Into withdrawals. There's a very small percentage of people that could present with like a flash pulmonary edema, but the bacon is with those withdrawals. So then yeah, you won one of their going to feel gross from the barf, you know, then could have a whole other vast problems going to go into a seizure. But yeah, usually you're getting a little bit of a fight with them. They're getting a little nasty because of the hypoxia as well write that lack of oxygen for so long.	-1.0
3	Sonia belly comes in place. I was concerned because wait Miss and introduce me on bedding, which is actually we were discussed this before the podcast though. There was a you know, when I went down taking that course in La we didn't talk about this part, but that was one of things they were talking about was there was of course I was taken and they open it up for firefighters and it was nutritionally for law enforcement and Military, but they opened up for firefighters and paramedics is because of that reason because they getting they get there. Maybe the police are on scene because it's it's a patient. It's not the next thing they're in a fight with them in the back of an ambulance are on the street. Is that video? We should we posted WE Post we put I think we posted it.	-1.0
1	Right. Did you do you posted?	1.0
3	All right. Yeah, and that wasn't a it was those are some guy mad because they're perfect show up here late for his car fire or something. But just that generally people are getting getting it assaulted anytime anywhere.	-1.0
2	It seems nine people be crazy and you know back to bring them up with naloxone like, you know, if you have the means as a responder with like a bag valve mask and oxygen no freeze for them. Give them that oxygen concentration. That's just going to help them come up so much nice. Afterwards where we're getting those fights is we're rolling up on scene and people are hammering with naloxone prior to our arrival, but they're not doing in ventilating then we start ventilating then we give them a little bit more logs on and then they come up from the quickly right? It's probably because they've already got a pile of Narcan in them, but then there are hypoxic and then we're battling that so they're just confused.	-1.0
3	Very good.	1.0
2	Yeah the lot of the overdose that I've been on before is, you know, we start ventilating them. And it's totally safe.	1.0
1	It's controlled as calm or breathing for them.	1.0
2	Then you get ready. Then you give them the naloxone you bring them up slow. It's way safer. Yeah you then they'll come up they get a little confused. They pull their way out and then they'll start talking to you. Some of them come to the hospital. Some of them don't someone tell us to peace out. But yeah, we want these people to be transported to the hospital or at least if they refuse service to be with somebody to be monitored because Locks on will have a shorter shelf life. It will burn off faster in their system than the opiates.	1.0
3	Well the exhibit ask you about that because you'd told me before sometimes you just you are kind of and then after a while you just carry on your way. Like you guys are just leaving. Yeah if they wanted to yeah, but then tell us that counts and I was wondering what back is eventually like you said dinner kind of wears off quicker than the opioid so that like mentioned of those go back out possibly. Yeah, exactly.	1.0
2	So the generally the naloxone has a shelf life and like 45 minutes 40 minutes somewhere around there I think and so the opiates will reattach to the ER opiate receptors in your body and then you'll start going on and not again, so it's just exactly what sounds like you're nodding off asleep you're falling asleep. So they could potentially go down again generally will give repeat doses over with them or by that time the hospital will end up giving a repeat dose if they're still willing to stay in the hospital. Some people actually go on the locks on drip in the Bill because they've got such strong opiates in their system.	-1.0
1	So with that I mean again on that broken Puck I said they were talking about some insane numbers of people that actually had died more recently. Obviously those numbers have gone up dramatically since especially since the fentanyl surface started coming in but it what kind of do you know of any kind of numbers it could be floating around for even just BC. Oh, yes. Yeah so our	-1.0
2	crisis it eventually became an epidemic in 2015 and then this for BC alone for last last year in 2018. We had a total of fifteen hundred and forty-one overdose deaths here in BC that those numbers are dropping substantially from the previous years mostly from the information about opiates and how it can affect vast variety of people and also just the Carrying a kit, you know having having kids out there.	-1.0
1	So I mean, I guess the big thing now obviously off the back of that is we obviously you know, because we knew you it was it worked out for us, but if somebody let's say somebody else somewhere else was looking to get this sort of training. Who would you recommend they go and talk to start having this conversation.	1.0
2	I think the big thing is look out the people in your area as far as if it's other paramedics that can at least stereo the right way. Way or in your department if you guys have other Educators because that made this game be tied in with a lot of public education. So far Services can get out there and do that as well. If you're a trainer talk to your local Health authorities and healthy and it's there the big ones that'll that'll kind of front this for sure.	1.0
3	Yeah. I don't know if Ashley I would just down in Nevada. You want to Vegas we were talking at one of the Uber drivers about Opioids and stuff because we were when we're driving the ground to cover rougher part down and they were cut you just kind of surprised that we even do Narcan they were saying oh, yeah, we did we did start entering couple last week. He's like, why would you guys have that I would you guys help so I don't know if some of the some of the states are less open-minded to that sort of stuff. So no because I don't like California is but yeah California's a lot. BC from I understand but I think certain States down there are maybe not quite as open.	-1.0
2	Well, that's just it's all public education. Right? I mean, there's so many opinions with it like you got a lot of harsh opinions and well, why are you helping some of these overdosed, you know like but like I said like with when somebody approaches me, I just tell them they look like I've literally my career I've had to resuscitate like 14 year olds from Man overdosed in the past and it wasn't intentional like they're not a drug user. It was a first-time experiment that went South man. Everybody's got a mom and dad right? And so they're very happy that we brought them back. So there's a there's a lot of information on there just needs to the public needs to be aware of and it could be anybody could be completely accidental.	-1.0
1	That's the other side of it too. I mean, it's not just the accidental side of things is the fight that stuff's in anything. These days right? Like you said you could have you could have bummed a cigarette off of somebody and all of a sudden they gave you the wrong one prescription meds. Right?	-1.0
2	Like you could be taking heavy prescription narcotics due to a chronic or an acute event in your life traumatic pain or something and accidentally take too many or mix another pill that makes you more subsequent to overdose. Right like you never know. So having that just that knowledge around it. It's you how to recognize the Uh science, so it's it's big nowadays. It's a different world. We're in now.	-1.0
3	Okay, one thing for sure down the states with their veterans going back. Well, then, you know, they've been blown up shot. There. Are those pills are you talking to?	0.0
2	Yeah, and you know at the end of the day Latos, the the prescription meds are safe. But if you do combine some of them you are more prone to a possible overdose. You got to be very aware of the timing when you take them.	-1.0
1	Have a conversation find out if if you weren't using it. It's a good idea to at least have the conversation and at least be trained on it because there may be a time where you need it. I was lucky enough that Todd managed to give me a kit and I still carry it with me and my go back you never know just in case right even though you might have froze at the other human like a Frozen and I might need a new one. But yeah, they're they're useful to have you never know. Situation and yeah again seems the tourniquet right should probably carry one never know when you might need it and it will put it over.	1.0
3	But yeah, let's show some announcements.	1.0
1	Yeah, I'm sorry ashes in there.	-1.0
3	So I guess I got any more to see. All right, dude, yelling you gonna do you have a second to know? I don't yeah.	-1.0
1	Yeah, that's a mortise.	-1.0
3	They make pretty cool gear. They make the snagger tool which we talked about. I've seen it used.	1.0
1	I've actually got to play around a little bit. It's it is pretty pretty sweet.	1.0
3	You pull hose with Eddie and you can run a two and a half actually quite well using it like soda solo. You know, I know there's a couple techniques like what we call when we call the Jimi Hendrix that it that is taxing on you. It is tiring did use that method just it's To remove two and a half by yourself standing up. It does deplete you put the this negative when I when I used it as actually it's quite quite a lot easier to handle hose that big run a full. Yeah. So motifs that makes them kind of other cool stuff door wedges and things check them out on their website. We're supposedly getting some new stuff.	1.0
1	Yeah greatness like a goody bag or one of their new New like if they don't medical bike things as well, I think sure exactly are they truck kit by exact.	1.0
3	She's getting it. He probably has his 40 hangars Christmas. Yeah. It's very safe operations.	1.0
