3	Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Fan into flame podcast. I'm your host as always Tyler warfel. Thanks for coming back and listening to another episode on this episode. We're going to give our season recap of the Fall Sports season, which were tremendous really historic seasons for our volleyball and soccer teams. We interview the soccer Captain's Christian Josh and Auggie. We also interview the volleyball seniors Amanda and Renee. We did have a slight audio malfunction during the soccer interview in my iPad fell over but we decided to just roll. That starting with soccer the boys won the dvcac championship for the second straight year by beating Chestertown again this time by a score of 3 to 2. In my opinion. This was the best of the Championships since we've been back in the dvcac the last four years. We've played Chestertown each of those four years. The first year was 2016 and we'd split with them in the regular season. I kind of thought we were the better team Alex scored an early goal in that game, but Chestertown scored to kind of flew key goals. The first one was just kind of a bad mistake barkeeper. / and the second one was a little controversial in that it was a long shot from near the corner. It looked like the ball might have gone out of bounds in the air and then come back in regardless. It was enough to give Chestertown a 2-1 win the next year in 2017. I don't think there's a question that we were the better team. We had beaten them for 1 and 5 3 in the regular season, but the game got kind of ugly there were lots of fouls going around the final score ended up being 4-3 in overtime. But three of the goals were scored on penalty kicks to from us and one. Them there just wasn't really a good flow to the game which in my opinion gave Chestertown the advantage in that game and to their credit. They took advantage in one in overtime last year, even though the final score was two to one. I feel like we kind of dominated the game Chestertown scored late to make it a one goal game. But as a fan at least it didn't really ever feel like we're going to lose. It was a great atmosphere great environment IDE Turf a lot of fans a night game under the lights great atmosphere, but we scored early and pretty much control the play. Why this year was different? Like I said from a fan perspective. I think this was the best game. I think the teams were very evenly matched. They both played. Well Augie scored in about the 10th minute to give GMS a one nothing lead, but Chestertown pressed up and scored a nice goal about 15 minutes later the tied at 1-1 and it looked like they really had the momentum at that point heading into halftime and looked like we kind of needed to regroup but right before halftime Augie worked a little magic. You dribble between a handful of Chestertown Defenders and scored about a minute. With a half-time whistle to give GMS a two to one lead. That was a huge goal to get the momentum back on our side but Chestertown came out in the second half continue to press continued to play well and they found another equalizer with probably about 25 minutes left in the game. They got a long throw in from either Corner found an unmarked man for a header to tie the game at 2-2, but with 10 or 15 minutes left Auggie again dribbled past a few Defenders got into the box and got tackled from behind for a penalty kick which he converted pretty easily in the To the upper left corner, and that would be the final score it ended three two, there were some nervous moments at the end Chestertown kept attacking and had several good chances, especially on set pieces and Corner kicks, but our defense held on Christian had a really strong game. David was really good in gold and I think you had other Defender step up and play well and not make mistakes. I thought between Austin and Kobe and I thought Adam and Cody did a good job, too of not making any defensive errors. There were a few Corner kicks that were a little worried. With Chestertown players that were unmarked but overall the defense gave a really good performance. So it was a really exciting game. We had a lot of fans support despite the fact that it was a Saturday afternoon on the day of the Fall auction and not a very short drive up to bear. So it was a good day for GM s soccer a great way to end a really good season boys finished with an overall record of 13 wins one loss and 1 tie this season. They were 9 and 1 in conference play and obviously dvcac soccer overall. Is not the highest level of play, but I think it's improving and there weren't as many blowouts this year as in the past couple of years Chestertown Calvary and Faith Baptist were all pretty competitive. But in the three non conference games, we went to wins and 1 tie combine this year and last year and you have a two year record of 29 wins one loss into ties with to conference championships. That's really impressive and it's actually the best two-year run in GMS soccer history, and I think it just speaks to the job. Mr. Bechtel has On as a coach in building a program and there's been some really talented soccer players the last several years and some of that have been kind of unexpected. You know, Alex Augie and Christian all transferred to GMS for high school and didn't go here during elementary and middle school. So it's always nice to be able to add that level of ability into your program when you don't necessarily see that coming from the Middle School team. Then you also have Caleb and Joshua Lee who are also very talented soccer players that have been at GMS since kindergarten and throw in David Mendez into that mix too. But what's impressive about what the soccer program is a right now is that you get a lot of production from guys. You wouldn't necessarily consider themselves soccer players. You can see the Improvement of skills year by year from guys like Kobe and Ryan and Carson and Adam guys. It didn't really grow up playing soccer. But Mr. Bechtel gets the best out of them and to me that's the sign of a program that's here to stay and speaking of that. This is this team has no seniors. So they'll return to everyone from a team that just had Tremendous season to look for another big year and in our leg there aren't a lot of seniors Chestertown only graduates to Calvary just one and Faith Baptist doesn't have any seniors either so look for next year to be a really competitive year in the dvcac and I know that like worship rep who's kind of the top dog in the easyacc has seen some of our scores last couple of years. They want to play us next year. So next year could be a lot of fun for our soccer team will wrap up soccer with some awards because we've placed first in the regular season. Mr. Bechtell got to select seven of his players to play in the dvcac All-Star Game this year Junior's Augie Pacheco Christian quillin, Austin, swartzentruber Carson UNC and Josh Willie were selected along with sophomore David Mendez and freshman Nevin Yahtzee for Christian and Josh. It was their third All-Star selection for Austin for Augie. It was his second and for Austin Carson David and Nevin, this was their first time playing in the game Augie Christian Josh and Devon were additionally named to the all-conference. The team which is the best 11 in the conference and that's a really high honored to be named that team. We have posters that we make for the all-conference players. They'll be hung up at school sometime in the coming days. Augie was given medals for being the leading goal scorer and the leader in assists in the conference during the regular season and Josh was given one for leading in assists. He and Augie tied Atop The League for most assists a few other statistical leaders that weren't recognized at the All-Star games, but just throw these out there David Mendez was six in the league in goals. With seven which is impressive because he mostly plays goalie. Christian quillin was seventh in assists with for Carson Yahtzee with 18 goals with 6th and 10th and assist with three Nevin Yahtzee was 7th and assist with for and 11th in goals with four and then obviously all he led the league in both goals and assists 21 goals 11 assists and that's just in conference play Josh tied for first in assist with 11 and was 16 goals with seven. So that's a wrap on soccer. Make sure to come back next year and watch Team that we return everyone and some exciting things could be happening next year for our soccer team Auggie is just two goals away from becoming just the eighth player in GMS history to score 50 or more goals and Josh is just one assist away from joining Auggie in the 25 assist Club. Joshua be the seventh player in program history to have 25 or more assists look for that early in the season. All right. I'm joined Now by Christian. Hey, Josh and Auggie captains of the soccer team. You guys had a great season last year you had two of the all-time greats here Alex you leading assist of all time and EMS history killed the leading goal scorer all time. You lost them to graduate from last year and yet you still managed to have a great season. What did you have to do this season to make up for the losses of those two guys.	0.0
1	We really had to start playing. The team and not relying on two players to just bail us out every time we needed the strength or the courage to win a game.	1.0
3	So so you go into the championship game playing Chestertown for the fourth straight year for you guys Josh and cushions your third year. I'll be your second. How does it feel to play the same team Chestertown year after year in the championship with the preparation? Like for that really what I do before I play chess town.	1.0
1	I just	0.0
3	get mentally prepared and knowing that they're if they usually have a strong team that we play against and I mean it would be I guess it would be good for to play somebody else in the championship.	1.0
1	But I always look forward to playing chess town and Championship.	1.0
3	So score was 1:1 towards the end of the first half and Josh something happened in the box there didn't look like it was a ton of contact, but you went down and were down for a while with an injury and I can tell you standing next to You your parents and other people on the sidelines there were some worried people over on the sidelines both one for your health. But also then if you couldn't return that would be a big loss for the team can tell us about what happened there. And yeah, so basically like this kid earlier on the game he went for like a slide tackle and that's when I went down on my shoulder. Like that's when it started to hurt a lot and then later on another kid like hit me in the shoulder and that's when I went down in the box. So so you set off for the rest of the Half did come back in the second half and then I don't know 15 minutes, maybe into the second half you took a shot from just outside the box that the fans over on our side line were ready to cheer and explode in excitement and then it hit the crossbar. So what were you thinking on that chat do you think was going in? I thought I was going to go in because I put like I hit a knuckleball and it was moving and the keeper couldn't do much. I felt bad. Yeah, I was gonna ask you. What was your feeling when it crossbar pretty bad? Yeah. Thankfully we were able to still maintain our composure there and then Auggie you got a penalty kick late in the game there then end up being the game-winner. There were some Chestertown fans and the calvary players and some of their fans to kind of yelling at the keeper trying to give them instructions as to which way you were going to go. Did you hear them at all? What were you thinking when you stepped up to the Penalty spot there?	0.0
1	The first thing that came to my head is we should I kick it because I could hear everybody shouting he's gone, right?	-1.0
3	He's gonna write their players were shot in his own rights on him to go right but I was calling my name is on make it and I went I stuck to my plan and I made it. How did it feel after you made it good? That's like the best feeling. Yeah. Yeah. All right guys. Well, thanks for coming on and hope you have a good offseason and be ready to back go back again next year. Oh right on the volleyball side of things what a season for the girls coming into the year. The focus really was on everyone that graduated the girls return just two players from last year. And the question was could the young players on this team play well enough to compete at the varsity level. There was obviously some talent but what it translate to Varsity the first year and the answer ended up being a very definitive. Yes, the girls went 12 and 2 and won their first dvcac championship since 2004 15 years ago. Oh, that's a long time and this wasn't like soccer because the boys had been there the last several years and they were kind of expected to be back in the championship for the girls. This was kind of Uncharted Territory. And as I was standing there watching the consolation game before the championship the girls looked like they were locked in and ready now hindsight is always 20/20, but they looked like a team that was ready to go win a championship and it showed right from the start of the game. They just look like they were much more prepared to play in a game of this magnitude than their opponent was they won. The first game 25:21 and pretty much Controlled it the whole way. It just never felt like Chestertown could get any momentum going in that first set. And the thing is we made a lot of serving errors. I'm not sure the exact number in the first set but we made 13 serving errors overall. That's a lot. So if you take away those serving errors, this was a complete domination in the first little bit of the game. That was the only way Chestertown with scoring. We were doing everything else better than them. And after that first win the girls came out with a lot of energy momentum and were dominating the second set. I think it was like 16 to 7 when Chester town called a timeout and coming out of the timeout they were able to regroup and start to play their game a little bit. They came all the way back and we're within 24 23 and they were serving the ball and they served it out of bounds and gifted us that last point for a 25-23 win. And now it was to nothing the last set started off poorly for GMS Chestertown. Got an early lead in maintain that for a long time. It felt like our girls maybe it just taking their foot off the gas a little bit. They just weren't as crisp with their And their hits as they had been in the first two sets, but they got a timeout refocused eventually took their first lead at 17 16 and then didn't look back with a score of 2421 Chester town called their final timeout, but it didn't help Amber Humphries served up an ace For the Win. It was a very exciting moment for the girls as they celebrated their well-deserved Championship. So really the question for this season was how do you go from losing almost your entire team the year before including two All-Stars and one all-conference player and Glee start brand new in win a championship with that team and I think a big part of that is good coaching the coaches recognize where their strengths and weaknesses were and put girls in positions where they could use those strengths and not have to do things. They couldn't do and coaching is great. But ultimately it comes down to the players on the court and you had two freshmen coming this year who were very good hitters and Amber and Kailyn and so you wanted to get them hitting as much as you can and in order for them to be able to hit you need good sets and Riley will pretty much give you a good set every single time even if she The bad path she's going to set her hitters up with a quality opportunity for a kill the strategy is if you can get Riley setting the Amber and killing as much as possible. You're going to be in good shape. Not a lot of teams in our league have three players as good as those three and it showed in the championship game and then aside from those three, you want your other three players on the court to be able to minimize mistakes and make the easy plays you want them to be able to dig when needed give Riley a good pass for a set. You want them to build a serve well and not make a lot of serving errors and I think they did that between Amanda Renee. Elsie and Emily you got solid role players that allowed the team to succeed they knew their jobs and they performed them well, and I think this team really showed what good teamwork can do for the success of a team in any sport not everyone's going to play the same role on the team. Some players are going to get more action more hits more shots, whatever it may be and the players need to recognize their role and buy into it for a team to be successful and the girls did that a lot of that's on the coaches to put them in those roles and make sure the players clearly understand their roles and in my opinion, that's Made this team great and weren't that tall? In fact, there are high school volleyball team. They would be probably considered short. So when you watch them play, it's not like a jump out at you right away, but they just worked really well together and understood their roles and brought home a banner to hang in the gym and the future looks very bright for GMS volleyball Riley's just a sophomore Kailyn and Amber are freshmen Emily and Kelsey are freshmen you lose to girls abandon Renee and you'll need to replace them. They played well, but there are some quality players coming up for the Middle School ranks next year and I think you're looking potentially at another really good year and I think I think they should be the favorites in the league heading into next season a few Awards to recognize here for volleyball Kaelyn Amber Riley and Amanda were all chosen to play in the dvcac All-Star Game. Amber was second in the league in Aces with 43 and forth in kills with 82 Riley led the league in assist with 172 and she led an Aces as well with 45 and second place for us. This was 78 so that each shows what a wide margin. She led a sister. She had a hundred seventy two second was 78 Kelsey was 19th. And Aces with 12. Amanda was ninth in Aces with 18 and Calum was first in kills with 125 forth in Aces with 31 and seventh in blocks with seven. There was a little bit of controversy with the volleyball All Conference team when the teams were first announced that the All-Star Game a couple of weeks ago. Kalyn was named all-conference and she was the only one from GMS to be named all-conference. They chose six players that night to be recognized as all-conference members now, they got it wrong. There was some miscommunication there there should have actually been eight players selected for that team. And so what happened is the His went back and re voted for two more players to be added to the all-conference team. And when they did that both Amber and Riley were selected. And so we ended up with three All Conference members Kalin Amber and Riley. I do think it's kind of absurd that Riley especially was not named all-conference originally in the top six. I think if you look at both the stats that she put up and just watch her play. You would know that. That she definitely is one of the six best players in the league and maybe could make the case that she's the most important player in the entire league. If you look at again her assist numbers 172 assist compared to second place with 78. She led the league in Aces as well. I think that she should have been on that top 6, but regardless they got it, right eventually her and Amber were also named to the all-conference team. So congratulations to those three. Kaelan, Riley and Amber. All right. I'm joined Now by Renee and Amanda. Hi, so you guys did not play volleyball last year. You decided to play this year for your senior year all in all. Are you glad you played?	0.0
1	Yeah. I'm actually very glad I played I feel like it was a really good experience and it was a lot of fun to play. It was something new from you try and I really enjoyed it. How about you Amanda? It was a lot of fun playing with like all the girls like the freshmen especially because I've never gotten to know them very well. Like kayln and Amber and Kelsey and all them this want to play with them and just have that experience.	1.0
3	So talking about the championship game. Now, what was your mindset like going into the game where you nervous or excited where you calm? Sorry Amanda?	0.0
1	I was really excited. I was kind of nervous because it was against Chestertown and they had beaten us before but I knew that we could get them and I had a Chick-fil-A Sandwich before the game. So that really helped	1.0
3	You want to add anything to that Renee or I mean personally, I was like really nervous.	-1.0
1	But yet at the same time. I was like really ready to go.	1.0
3	Like get the game over with kind of did it make any difference that you were playing Chestertown and not someone else because you for one lost to them in the championship in basketball last year and had split with them in the regular season.	-1.0
1	I thought that it made a big difference because I remember basketball season last year that championship game was really brutal and we all really wanted it because we had beaten them before.	1.0
3	So after you got the final point to win the championship, how did that feel	0.0
1	it was pretty great. Like I've never really felt that way before it was like probably one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. Yeah. It was really cool because like the volleyball team Adam wanted 15 years and it's like a big milestone just to win again and like I haven't done like a basketball like we haven't won the basketball championship or anything. So it was just really cool.	1.0
3	So, how's Basketball going? Are you going to win a championship this year that it was so I think we have a chance.	1.0
