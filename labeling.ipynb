      " Welcome back to the Lash base podcast today. We have a very different episode. It is our first interview. We have a very special guest is episode 19 and we are here with Sarah Fisher of Farnum eyelashes. Let's get started. So here we are then before I pass you over to Tara who are interviewing. I'm sat here as well with lash base Amy. We're going to be asking the questions. Hi. So we wanted to do interviews and speak to people that have been there done that and been in the industry for a long time. This is because I know you can listen to us talk and talk and give you all the Our advice but we thought we'd get someone that has even more experience and Give their views and their advice on how they feel the industry is what they like what they don't like and where it can improve as well. So that's where we wanted to go with this podcast. We're going to be doing more interviews as we move forward. However, we wanted to get someone very special very close to lash base believe it or not. I think she'll tell you in a minute, but I think she has been going for even longer. She's been in the industry for longer than lash basis even been around and we've been around for 10 years now, so Anyways, without further Ado our partial over so tarah tell us a little bit about yourself.\n",

      " Hi, I'm Tara Tara Fisher from Farnum eyelashes and based in South Farnham on the submarine Hampshire borders. I'm actually just entering into my 11th year of lashing. So I've been around a long time. I just also would like to say thank you to Jamie and to Amy for having me here this afternoon to record this podcast. You're very welcome Tara. I just want to ask you quickly before we get going. And how do you feel today? Because I remember when I first started it was completely nervous. And I'm really quite nervous. This is the first time I've done anything like this and like most people I expect I hate the sound of my own voice.\n",

I Reggie, I record these podcasts and then I listen to myself back and I yeah, may I make a me listen to the podcast over and over but in all seriousness everybody hates the sound of their own voice and I'm sure you with 11 years experience you are gonna be able to provide so much value to people in this episode. So as you are already aware, we sent you some questions because we wanted you to be able to think about it. We didn't want to put you on the spot apart from the end of this episode when we give you the quick fire questions because I'll be interesting to find out what your thoughts. So what we want to do is be either the podcast is to provide as much value as possible to people that are listening. So I'm sure they'll be lots of people are interested in how on Earth you've managed to get through 11 years, and I'm sure we'll talk about it soon. In that your prices. Wow, and your diary as you know, because your you run it very full. So we're going to start with some questions and we'll get your take on it.\n",

      " Okay, Tara. So first of all, I just want to ask you when did you get started? I know you've just said that it's you coming into our 11th year, but but yeah, when did you start so I took my first course in October of 2009. Like I say I'm now entering into My 11th year, which is quite scary. I took a classic course then and then I did my volume training in 2014. And then my last game kind of really changed after that when I did some mentoring with Vicki rug in 2017, and I haven't looked back since what I find interesting actually.\n",

      "Speaker 2 \n",
      " Sorry. I kind of I mean you were going to be asking some questions then can't help myself a I find it interesting. So you took your first course in 2009, right? Yes, okay, and then you went five years before doing volume. Can I ask you know, this isn't part of one of the questions I sent what were your reasons for having a five-year Gap or trying to master Classics or or what was your thinking behind it?\n",

      " I think I was just happy plodding along doing my Classics and volume wasn't really well-known of then and it it really wasn't a big thing then and all of a sudden in 2014. It had started to get big. So that's why I waited so long.\n",

      "\n",
      "Speaker 2 \n",
      " So if you had to go like if you were starting fresh now, how what would your views be now? Because if you took classic and then it took five years to do volume, I get it that volume wasn't a thing. So that's a a reason. However, what are your views on either going straight into volume or is there what would you do now is basically more\n",

      " Should I think I think that if you've got the right trainer then going straight into volume is or can be a good idea and I've seen some really good results. Vicky ruggers talk straight to volume and some of our students have been amazing, but I do think that if you haven't got the right trainer or the right educator, then it could end in disaster on the flip side of that some students just get it and they just can produce fans straight off if They can then Classics is a really good base for them to start and I think once they've got the knowledge and the basics and they've got, you know, a good few months of Classics under their belt and they're competent enough isolation. And yeah, absolutely isolation attachment and just all of those things and I think and also just having the confidence in the work that they're producing then it's time to move on. Yeah. I come completely agree with you Tara and so moving on we just want to talk about Your first course. What was it? Like my first course was actually really really good. It was really in depth. We covered lots of health and safety.\n",
