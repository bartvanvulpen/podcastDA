      " I love it. I love this. I really do. We've had a few questions from people and a lot of the weird random diems have to do with us and like the most absolutely hammered we've ever been It seems like we give the impression that we're drinking which we are we do. We do give that impression and I just want to say that yes, we enjoyed a drink but like we don't we don't do that every day, and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. No, it's we're working on it. We're working on our no so as we're drinking wine, so no, so basically a lot of them had to do. With stories of us and like the most Hammer we've been together and we were thinking and I said to myself. Well, I mean the most hammered I've ever been just hasn't been with her. Yeah. We kind of came to that conclusion that like we have been very much hammered together college high school, but God well no together. No, I know but you mean other than like being together. I like we're going to tell some stories and one of my stories of the most drunk. I've ever been has been in high school. I started early start him young start him young I really did. Like I had like a lot of things in high school, which mine was in college mines mines pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to start? I'll start. All right. Okay our love. Okay. So this was when I was 20 years old, so I wasn't 21 yet and I feel like when I turn 21 Unlike just a side note like I tamed down a little bit. That's not like as like yeah. Yeah, you're 21 like drinking song is fun anymore. Yeah, like don't get me wrong. There was no thrill. I mean there was a thrill they're still a threat or so, but this was back when it was like Wild and Woolly. Okay, so I was 20 and it was about three months before I was going to be 21 years old. So a bunch of my friends at that time. We're turning 21. It was junior year. Everybody was like had that calendar out, you know what I mean when like they were had like the 21 countdown. Oh, yeah, three months two months one month. So my friend had a birthday in January and she decided to hold it at this club called story bill and it's in Boston and it's it used to be super fun. I don't really know what it's like now, but I said to myself I'm going to go and it's going to be awesome and we're gonna we're gonna get in there and I had a fake ID at the time and it was a Real a real fake ID if that makes any sense. It was a real human being I had a girl from Suffolk who just like totally hooked me up like she had dark hair and blue eyes and just like she just let me have it. I gave her 50 bucks to get a new license and she just she was awesome. She was the MVP. So I had I had an ID and at the time I was eating a guy who was older so he was over 21 and I said, you know, we I really want to go to this. I want to celebrate her birthday. 'The day he said sure the day of the birth day comes I was I remember I like legitimately like of course went Forever 21 and like found a sexy jumpsuit with like a super crazy v-neck in it and I was like, I'm hungry. Yeah. I was like, I like feeling myself.\n",
