      " Hello and welcome to raising vegan twins. I'm so excited for you to be on this podcast. I definitely knew that when I was going to launch the podcast. I wanted to launch one with an introductory episode. That way I can let you know a little bit about me what this podcast is about and you can kind of make your decision based off of that whether you want to keep Checking in or not. So obviously this podcast is going to be about raising. My vegan twins. You'll get to follow us on our journey. They are currently about to be 14 months. So yeah, they're getting big they've been vegan basically their entire life.\n",

If you've read my bio or the summary of the podcast you see on there that I am calling myself the mother of all mothers. So I wanted to explain that definitely in this episode. So I'm obviously a mom of multiples. So that's one type of mom that I am the second kind of mom is just being a bonus mom. So I do have a bonus daughter. So for those of you that don't know what that is. That means she's my step kid. She's my stepdaughter. She is what I like to call my part-time kid. We have her 10% of the time and she has with her mom 90% of the time so we have her basically two times a month and In that short time frame she gets to hang out with the kids which are her siblings and her dad. She is not vegan. I think that one time she did try and attempt to be vegan. She was vegan for the weekend and she it was really funny watching her. Look at the ingredients the way I do and she'd ask me is this vegan is this vegan and I'd guide her through it and then next time we picked her up. She was like, yeah. I know. I ate a hotdog and I'm like, wow, it was really funny. And she said no.\n",

It doesn't mean that I'm going to sit here and tell you all the benefits of being vegan and all the reasons why you should do it too and all the reasons why you should raise your kids vegan. I am not about That I'm not about telling anybody what to do. I think that my podcast is going to be here more to educate you on my life not necessarily to have you sway one way or the other that's that's your choice a hundred percent your choice and your kids are going to be raised the way that you wanted raise them. You know, I'm definitely not here to tell you to do it one way or the other or my way is Better no. No. No, you know you guys make your decisions and just listen to to the podcast and make your decisions off of your own research. Definitely don't don't feel the need to to do something or live the lifestyle just because you're listening to the podcast. There's a zero judgment zero judgment Zone moving on to the other kind of mom that I am I am. I am in the process of becoming a surrogate mom that is exciting news. That's kind of a little mini bomb that I wanted to drop on you guys. So I want to shine some light into that area of my life. We are in the beginning stages. I wouldn't say the early stages. That was a long time ago. That was like back in November. That's early stages. So I've been in this process for quite some time quite a few months. So it is I'm not I am now ready. It is time for me to reveal this news to you and part of the reason why I wanted to do that and why I wanted to include my surrogacy process in this podcast is because of the feedback that I've gotten by family members and non family members. So I I wanted to shine some light into that part of my life to help people make the correct decisions and to help people understand what it's like to be on my side. I know that people see a lot of advertisement about making x amount of money to help and what not and I basically want to give you my side of the story and why I'm doing it. So one of the next episodes will be about That specifically just surrogacy so stay tuned stay tuned for more on that process and the fourth type of mother that I am I like to say that I'm a mother F. ER so side note. I don't cuss that much when I do it's very rare, but I won't say I don't do it. I do do it sometimes but if I can avoid it I will So I am a mom of multiples. I'm a bonus Mom. I'm becoming a surrogate mom and I'm a mother F ER. So I am the mother of all mothers or at least I'm calling myself one.\n",
