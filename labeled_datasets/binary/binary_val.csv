Yeah, so and that is that is also really based on where you are in the country that we see in certain markets where you've had over expansion particularly multifamily. We do see it maybe not cooling off as the Word, but returning to normal, so Manhattan is a great example of this the multi-family residential boom in Manhattan. They were the let them in the market has doubled over the last five points there. And so it's going to pull back it's going to come back off of highs from probably probably do the extent to 25 30 30 percent decline of construction put in place, but it's still going to be a big building Market. It's just going to pull back quite a bit and it won't be as crazy competition will be fiercer DC star. Going to pull back a little bit in terms of Spin and so in certain Pockets where you can wrap intention Nashville's a great example, we've had rapid expansion over the last several years. We see a leveling off and maybe even a slight pullback, but you're also seeing a rotation and Healthcare sector fewer and fewer large sort of bed Tower Hospital projects coming out of the ground seeing a shift towards more. If you look at spaces like Hospitality hotels are going up all over the place, but the economy is good.

That doesn't belong for example the other day there was a toy a up there. There are certain things that go up there like a plant framed pictures a key basket, but there's other things that shouldn't you know, glasses there certain things that I allow up there and then certain things that just don't belong up there. So just remove any clutter from your living areas clear off the surfaces and the floors and then of course lastly you're going to want to sweep or vacuum the floors and there. And that's probably going to take the most of your time but it also probably causes the most impact as far as how your house looks having clean floors in your living areas, whether they're vacuumed or swept and mopped can make a huge difference in the appearance of your home. It'll definitely give you that bang for your buck people will be able to tell that you've cleaned, you know vacuuming and dusting is a big thing. So, Most of your time might be on vacuuming or picking up the floors. Most of your time might be spent on that. But since I can talk faster than you can clean. I'll give you some ideas of bonus chores in those areas and perhaps it's a day that you don't need to sweep or vacuum. Maybe your floors already look good some things that you can do are additional dusting. Maybe you need a desk some knickknacks a bookcase a piano. Maybe you have a window to wash - or you know something really occasional like dusting the baseboards. I've talked about this before but an easy way to dust your baseboards is to rubber band a microfiber cloth around the bottom of a broom and then just rub those baseboards or if they have a lot of buildup you might need to use a wipe. Our sponge or something like that and actually, you know you something wet, but if you keep it dusted you can prevent it from getting to grimy other bonus chores in the kitchen living areas.	0.0

Welcome to the wrong culture podcast. My name is Dane ver way. I'm an experienced Runner and running physiotherapist. I created this podcast not only so I had an excuse to talk running each and every week something that I love to do, but more importantly this podcast gives me the opportunity to interview fellow Runners friends and health professionals in a relaxed and easygoing format. This podcast is designed for the everyday Runner so we can all live learn. Grow and enjoy everything there is to running together. I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome back to episode 17 of the wrong culture podcast today. I interviewed a man Clark one of the athletes are coach from the Run culture hours. This is the third time I've caught up with Damien over the past six months. Although as you'll hear today's episode is a little bit different Damien's had a setback. He's recovering from an injury. He's had a month off running. Whereas over the past 2 episode Damien couldn't put a foot wrong. To in pee I have to pee. I love this podcast episode for a number of reasons one because I feel like a lot of people can learn from it anyone who's currently injured. I think we'll be able to learn and just sympathize with Damien over the past month and what he's going through. Damien also shows a fair bit of maturity in this episode. He's learned a lot since he had a major injury this time last year and he's definitely gone about this injury a whole heap better in terms of how he's viewed it and and Managed IT. He certainly has stopped listen to it and tried to get on top of it straight away. I also liked this episode because it shows that her load management isn't in tight tirely. The reason for this injury. So we've Damien. Yeah, he missed last season's track season and then we started introducing spikes so that it could do his 1500 and 5K races. And yeah, he's got saw in his foot because he started to use this. Spike's more but really the way that we introduced the spikes was very slow. And a lot of people would have been able to tolerate this load. So it shows that how how everyone's different and we learn from our experiences. So Damien and I will be better for this. We all know that okay, we have to ease our way forward and slowly build Damien's tolerance to track spikes and the speed work involved on the track. And this will come all right enough for me. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Okay, here we are again with Damian Clark and I will catch up.	1.0
That's so sweet pause it. That's so sad. Anyways, so I wrote Dolly's legit the most iconic woman. Yeah. Thank you so much.

Yeah, so that really ties to a lot of the research that we've been doing over the last three years on what we call mega-projects mega-projects find US capital intensive projects that require multiple teams pull off and they usually in excess of a billion dollars that we've seen have created lots of stress on the industry and on stakeholders within the industry owners designers. And and contractors and what we mean by you know, those the challenge for those projects being business-driven is going to take a large NFL stadium. For example, we have some sort of deadline that we've established for the stadium open probably based on kickoff of game one a couple Seasons from now and so we've got to figure out how to pull together the capital and power the contractor to the designed to get that accomplished within a another find window not necessarily. Taking the other crochet if we were going to build a structure like this, logically and efficiently, how long would it take? You know, we may be three season from now that that Stadium would logically be open and could be built in a way that the the labor market could provide sufficient labor. The contractors could do sufficient planning. The designer would have enough time to thoroughly designed the building to the extent that it's ready to be constructed by a contractor. It's the business pressures and that's just one example, you can apply that to really any project where there's a economic outcome a reason why they're every every project as an impetus for being constructed and if it's a private project because the return on investment the people are looking for if it's a public project is that there's a public use right and and those deadlines are driven by really the reasoning behind them project and that's very well understandable, but I think some of those deadlines of expectations but the public eye and from a business TenPoint have outstripped the capacity the construction industry to deliver on those expectations. And that's where we really see challenges. So back to the stadium example, we want to build a stadium in two years great. We don't have the local label Market to support it. We don't have time to pull the design together and we would stress the contractor Community to build it but we're going to try to do it anyways and roll the dice and see what happens and sometimes when you see favor welcomes, but more and more on these large projects. We are seeing unfavorable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.	0.0
It doesn't perfect her Ballroom technique, but it is definitely really good at like jazz your type things and like the Pumped kind of dance move. She's really natural at it. Like there's some things. I remember Posh. I came home from one of the first like rehearsals he has with her and they did a Cha-Cha and they had like this like funky move in there. He's like, it's just I didn't teach like I don't have to teach her that she just did it naturally and she just made it look great. So he's like I have to use that because her like comedic skills and like the way she moves her body when she does do her comedy is very simple like similar to the Cha-Cha or Jazzy or quick subtype 5, so it's very easy for him to teach her that kind of stuff. But when it comes to the technique, obviously, it's very difficult, right? She does a great job learning it. So there's definitely a great sense of her body awareness. She knows what she's doing. Not so it's very helpful.	1.0

Well, that's it. I want to thank you for spending this time with me today. I appreciate it going down memory lane. And that's great that you've written a book about fatherhood because you know black fatherhood is something that's that's not discussed enough or at least not discussed in the context in which you're discussing it like a lot of times. It's always the conversation is always about what black fathers aren't doing right as opposed to this is how you manage, you know, being a black father and what that means. So you speaking to it from that perspective I think is probably I'm sure Go help somebody hopefully yeah. All right. Well, good luck to you Cowboys. Yes. Okay. Thank you for having me. Yeah, no, no problem anytime. And yeah, I hope for your sake this season doesn't go doesn't derail. Just why I'm for nice family. Wow, that was real convenient that a real comedian.

Okay, so there is not that big a town. In fact, I could I think I could I could run around it probably in half an hour to an hour. So imagine you yeah, really go. I imagine that you've read every single Street in Bruner itself. So do you have it? Okay. No, I don't run in town. I've been out of town. Yeah, I don't like running around the town streets. So I like it when it's nice and quiet. So I do a lot of writing on the outskirts of town and along the dirt roads and things like that and you have a favorite course out there or do you just pick something different every day? What I am a creature of habit. I do have my few different routes that I do that my favorite. Is this the Buddha chill illegal trial, which is hardly anyone seems to know about but it's a beautiful little The trail part of the seemingly multiples went along there, but it's nice that you I never see anyone there. It's beautiful. It's undulating. You can see Mount French lie because of the distance of most of its shaded which is unusual for around here. So that would probably be my favorite I can if I start from home you can do that 30 case I suppose those trails. And then next next year I'm going to do the 200 bomb idiotic. Well, maybe the plan. Various lists the various. Wa very nice. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, beautiful try. I'm terrified about Well, I can't say I saw Iran maybe 60 or 70 case on that trail last year. And in that time I think I saw three or four snakes are quite a while snakes on that trial. But yeah, I see a lot of things here. So yeah, that doesn't yeah, but look the run like along the beaches and so on. I just yeah, 'best of Vine country. That's Show this the whole of the logistics of what bothers me the most is getting there and all sort of all that out, but there will get there and you know be an experience. That's for sure.

Sometimes we had like two days off in between but I remember the LA show. I think it was like our fifth show that week already. So we're so tired, but we're so excited because we knew so many people in the audience and there were going to be so many celebrities and famous choreographers and we're like everybody we cannot mess up because this is going to be the best show in that.

Before we continue I want to take a quick break to tell you about anchor anchor is honestly the easiest way to make a podcast for starters it's free, which doesn't get any better than that.

So after I read this chapter to you if you are interested in getting the full version it is available again on amazon.com the chapter that I'm going to be reading today is chapter. For the beginning of the season now, you may be thinking the beginning of the Season that sounds like it should be chapter one. But as you read this book, you'll realize that there's a lot more to coaching than just stepping onto the core and running practice and playing games again. This is going to be a pretty long podcast. I'm really excited to share this chapter with you. I hope it gives you some good direction and gets you excited for your next season of volleyball whether that's your And sixth or even first season, I hope you get pretty pumped.

So that's how that's how it is with most TV shows that are on Netflix though. Like for example, I know like people are like, oh breaking bad. I started it got to like season 2 and then I like went to a different show and started watching that like that's what ever does is they'll start a show on Netflix watch to like the second or third season and if there's more than that, then they kind of lose interest and go to a different show and then come back to that show later. You know, I'm saying that's All right on the cycle, I guess.	0.0
I'm like, I'm also the idiot. Let's get started.	0.0
Yeah, exactly. So who was engaged so I James I mean the whole time James got it. He got it. It was like like I like I was speaking to his soul and then I also felt like Jillian got it, but Jillian was Gillian was also incredibly, you know, she's Savvy as hell and so I mean like she is incredibly Savvy and so like A person like that can like you know, you think that they may have it but you're not sure until they say yes, you know and the other folks I could tell were like they're asking really good questions. So I think they were trying to get there but for whatever reason they couldn't respect, you know, but generally speaking, you know, I could tell that Jillian and James got it.	1.0
We even have world championships for people like that. We have a Pro-Am hold dancesport committee where The teacher competes with their student and we had we actually had women who came in and they've never done stay in their lives and they've been winning like World Pro-Am championships and it's amazing to watch it's so tiring. Yeah, and I love that about Ballroom because not every style of dance has that and I feel like there's a lot of closed doors when it comes to that but in Ballroom, you do have the chance to just go and compete with your student and make them the best they can bought like possibly feel and look and maybe when some titles absolutely like that. Yeah, I like that. Let's see we talked about Derek.	1.0
Yes, you know, I think I think I want to agree with Betty during this and just say that he's honestly probably just lonely and Confused from what I'm seeing. I think he's very trustworthy but he just doesn't know maybe who is his true friend. Like he said he got dropped from the farm. He felt very lost. But he lost his friends because he joined the farm. So he just needs to really be with his friends and really gain there. Trust back I think and we have a lot of people in the chat. Yes who are agreeing and they're saying that Kevin is we got a rune who Cote? I'm sorry if I butchered your name, but he says who's trust who trust Kevin is true to Betty and helps her or is he trying to get back in? What do you think think he's helping her? Maybe? He's just trying to get back in some sort of a friendship grazed or he's just lonely.	1.0

Technical so I was implementing EHR systems into lens Elise. And so I got into implementing EHR systems in quite a few of my previous roles. So it kind of just became my little niche and I think that's where I am quite good with all the technical side of things in business because that's my background.	1.0
Very good. Well, maybe I'll touch on that comment that the Big Dreams for the business at the end. But before I go into that something that's kind of related in a way to the retail side or the or the fact that there's almost this second business or what what I'm seeing in the industry from particularly from some of the staging businesses who have been in business for a little while and looking to add other revenue streams. I'm seeing little online stores pop-up not too common. But I've seen a few come up on the websites and and look it does make sense given that we do all this research when we're sourcing the Quality Furniture and we can often get better pricing through trade discounts or wholesale pricing. So I understand it and I think you've kind of done this in a clever way. Not only that you've got the That we just talked about but you also have done I guess it kind of an online just store but you've specifically called them bedroom packages and you've set up it this online store to sell what is essentially Furniture but in a bedroom package and I haven't seen that done quite the same anywhere else. So I you know, I'm really interested in the thought process behind or you know, how you came about deciding to do something like this or testing it out and kind of how you found it.	1.0

Yeah, it's so funny reading some of the comments on my YouTube channel because they're all like saying that I'm running around is like an atheist circle now and it's the actually like complete opposite of that. Like I still have all of my same friends from Junior High and high school and they are like all Christians and I'm kind of the only one that left. left which is kind of what has been so hard about this whole journey is just being like, you know the odd one out and it's just interesting to see like how his like I totally understand like not all Christians at the same and people are like don't just let like a few bad apples like ruin your experience, but I'm like guys like I love my friends like I know that they're not like bad people but I'm just sit like my whole thing is that sometimes the things that they Believe and do and say because of that can be hurtful and I don't think people realize that you know, and I've just like experienced a lot of that with my very conservative Evangelical fundamentalist fundamentalist friends.	1.0

Well, if you say so I went to LA and I saw Derek there and he's like, oh, this is so awesome. Like and I think he remembered me from yeah, that's what he was like, yes, but then we did that music video and it was just so successful like we had so many views on it and people loved it. They were sharing it for like a year after that. So it was insane. Well, actually it's been it's almost been a it's almost that here.	1.0

It's like you're in the forest Pine Forest / eucalyptus Forest nearby as well. You've got it come up this sort of Avenue of trees to the Finish. One and there's these big raging bonfires going you've got music pumping just a really good vibe at the finish line. And I just yeah, it's got the and the finish line and it's like lounges set up everywhere. It's like if I wasn't so exhausted I would have been able to participate a lot more when I Collapse on the lands for a bit and then I went and slept in my car, but it was yeah, it's worth it just for the video Finish Line. And party. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so there that's it. Awesome. Yeah. Well done cheese it. Yeah, that's another one down. And now I'm just going to recover and so yeah today what's next for you.	1.0

Yeah, so iron sharpens iron and some days. I don't like have man sharpens another right? So luckily I've got not rejected.	1.0
So The thought came about because that at one point I can't even remember when I launched the bedroom packages, but if this was quiet and I needed to create another income stream because when you're not staging properties, you need to find that how you've got to pay your bills, right? So I thought these bedroom packages would be a really nice idea because I had clients that would say to me. Oh, I just want you. Come in and transform my bedroom and just do it. I'll pay you so I kept getting these little hints from people. So I thought I'll try and make it a reality and it's a really simple concept that you can purchase a bedroom accessory pack and instantly your bedroom is made over with beautiful art and cushions and lights and it was really well received and I then started working on living room accessory packs. Kind of a similar idea. We just add the artwork in the cushions and the lamps but it all is in a theme.	1.0

Much space hopefully you got a lot done during this cleaning session. One last area that I don't always mention would be like a laundry room. You might not even have a dedicated laundry room.

No doubt, and the thresholds do matter but also know thing that matters and apparently Brian could conceive the same way is the res a relative Athletics for only one draft pick did not meet the elite threshold for that last year. That was cool Madison. We look at guys like Kendall diners and Mark was veiled is scamming Equity me saying Brown if they were Elite athletes, they were some of the best of the best at their pro day at their combine whatever and I think that does play a part with how he's guys read the the team drafts whether it is because of the pure athleticism that Baby, he reads the math bomb Twitter or he just has it own stuff that he goes on the pet. The Packers have an act like you said to draft spectacular athletes. And another good example is Oren Burks. He tested through the roof and jumped into the third round conversation could be starting at inside linebacker this year. So the RAS also plays a big part and I guess what did you see from that as far as how that factors in?	1.0

Like he's just I don't know what he's made out of but that guy is so energetic and he's just so talented and being his partner on tour was actually the coolest experience ever and his fans were so supportive. And what I really liked about him was the fact that he took the time out of his day. He came out of his trailer signed everybody's autograph talk to people so he wasn't kind of like, all right.

Being in charge is a big deal. It is not an easy task. When you're in charge of a group of people your job is to lead them that can mean guiding people showing them the way making sure everyone's doing what they're supposed to be doing.

And when you're in charge you have to make sure everything's happening to keep people safe and happy whether On a boat in a kitchen and a restaurant or through the entire country switch you're brushing to the bottom of your mouth and brush your molars in the way back. I'm speaking from experience here because I Rachel the Choppers lady. I'm in charge of chompers and I'm sort of in charge of all of you Champions. Well, I have to make sure that every morning and every night. There's a Choppers episode for you to listen to so that you chop Ian's never miss brushing your teeth. And part of my job is to remember to tell everyone to switch your brushing to the other side of the bottom of your mouth ambushed her front teeth, too. So you brush all of your teeth and not just so now that we know what it means to be in charge of a group it's time to make a choice which of these people is not in charge of a group the president of a country the chef of a restaurant or the captain of a boat are You have to come back to Choppers tonight to find out until then rinse with water before you leave to one.	1.0

You've got to figure out what it is that actually makes you feel alive. And if you understand that the game that you're playing is actually a game of brain chemistry and that nothing else matters.

There's only the subjective truth that thing inside you that gut instinct that voice that Whispers to you. You've got to learn to trust that you've got to learn to trust it by building it up. You've got to The Trusted by taking actions and gut checking yourself and asking is that me is that who I want to be or is that somebody else cultural voice my parents my lover whatever trying to speak through me and his Harley Davidson said when writing a story of your life, don't let anyone else hold the pen. So right now ask yourself. He's writing your story. Is it you are you really listening to the voice in your head? Are you looking at and listening? Living by the things that give you the chills or are you trying to live a life that somebody else wants for you? And remember when you think about that question what William James said act as if what you do matters because it does even if for nobody else every step you take every thought that you were allowed to permeate your mind everything you obsess about your dreams the things that you want the hopes that you spend your time.

I know it's a lot but but you know what? It's so common now, it's one of those like, oh, I have anxiety who have anxiety. I have depression. You have depression who like right is it is it you have a mental illness and I really love just that there is such a spotlight on it right now. I mean, I I have always gosh my parents got Divorced when I was we moved here to st. Louis when I was in third grade my parents got divorced when I was in fourth grade and that was a pretty ugly divorce. And so because of that my parents had put me in counseling with my brother. So I was used to that concept and then I went through high school and my dad was diagnosed with ALS and that just whole concept of watching my dad died for 18 years that was a lot but in the middle of that I kind of I was always the kid who had To do all the things I mean the old the oldest so I always felt the need to always be have be perfect and get good grades and Achieve and do all the great things - Sports because I suck at Sports and basically I went to college had a awful breakup with a boyfriend and I just kind of went off the deep end. I was I would say I can't quite remember two years of my life and rightfully so and that's that. My twin just the combination of my dad and that that break up like we were going to get married. It was like a whole thing. Like we were we were there and going I switched schools and like it just all kind of like whoo One Time Hit me and at that point my parents were like, okay, it's time like we need to talk to somebody you need to go see somebody and I started seeing a therapist and a weekly basis and I was diagnosed with anxiety PTSD from my parents divorced. From fourth grade which always seems kind of strange but I guess yeah, they're the experts there and it was recording of my Apple watch was recording that and so I started seeing by somebody and we talked and I we did we I went every week and like they would give me things to work on or things so and I was medicated at that point. I think I was on two different medications and I felt good and I felt like I was starting to like get the tools that Did to like handle my situation and and then kind of calm myself down when I was, you know, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They actually were able to help me give me extra time for taking tests and things like that at school because I would just get so overwhelmed that I could like put I wouldn't even take the test. I would just sit there and like fries. Yeah, which then made my last two years of college extremely difficult, right? And but then it was one of those really crazy things that I met my husband. Well, it was my seen my super senior year of Cool, super super semester my life physical senior plus like the extra semester and I met Jeff and it was one of those things that like, I don't know if it was just our yin and yang - of our personalities. He was able to just come in and be a really great kind of source of balance and understanding for me and slowly over that first year of us dating. I wean myself off of all of the medication that I had been on now people would be like, oh that's probably not the best idea but for He understood like where I was coming from and he knew my whole background and he was like he was in favor. Whatever I needed to do. Yeah, but he definitely wanted to make sure that one he could be as part of a because he could be in our relationship and so I have not been on medication since then but up until now I have recently started well in the last year or so. I started going back to a therapist just with Hattie going back to school and trying to figure out life and what's next for me in terms. Of the crazy world and just my role as a blogger and an influencer how that's changed. I get a lot of anxiety from just being a blogger. Yeah. So being on Instagram all the time feeling like you always have to be on and feeling exhausting for an extroverted interview. Yes. So exhausted. I'm feeling like you always have to have something fresh and new and that are going to get people excited to see what you're doing that day. That's A lot and then the flip side of that is if you would if you think you post something that's so you think you work so hard you did so great and then it tanks and it's like right. Well, you know, maybe I'm a failure or what's going on and then then there's days where like or I get a comments or I get like a series of things happen. I'm also really bad about like collecting all of my feelings and then exploding. Yeah. So that's also a whole nother conversation for another day, but it's I could basically like have a comment that will trigger me and then I Disappear for like a couple of days and and I just don't want to deal with like the world. But here I am. I've selected a profession that makes me forward facing to the world, but I'm human so it's kind of hard like it's it's a lot. So yeah, so I mean I find it helpful to you go to a therapist now I do so, but I feel like sometimes I find it helpful like we just sometimes we have nothing to talk about and like and those are the days I don't you. I have the same situation you go in and having nothing to talk about and then like some ugly yucky stuff. Just yeah boils up from the bottom and you're like where did that come from?

No, it's actually still pretty tall because we got one without all that it was like bumping the top of the ceiling we have tall ceiling. Yeah, so we didn't end up decorating them Saturday night, which was the plan. So on Sunday morning.

Wild and blue? Yeah. Yeah. She's been every year since so I actually bought her from the guy here and right here outside of town a friend of mine named Chuck Norris. He raised he raised his bucking horses and does some high school college and it's Amateur rodeos and has a brief program himself and and I actually bought two members from him and I'm kind of think that year. I bought those murder. I'm gonna say I think I bought those mares from him and like, oh, wait right in there and and I bought wild and blue who herself, you know bucks bucks. Obviously really? Well, she'd been to the NF are all these years and then there was another mare that came with her and her name was His Indian summer. Well Indian summer, she's just an okay Bronk. But remember when I was talking about that consistency of being really solid she oh one of those kind she's solid. She's like a 1920 pointer every time and she her oldest cult I have is a bronc named Indian burn and I took him we've taken him to the finals the last two years. He went as a four-year-old and five-year-old. So and And I know you're playing with fire taking a four-year-old to the National Finals. But but he's just that good and anyway, so that that purchase worked out pretty good for us by an electric bears from Chuck. So, you know, we got a boy, you know a really good mare that produces Colton and one that bucks really well herself. So yeah, that's about what they sometimes it hits like that.

Next one number seven is Skull town which from the map. I'm actually surprised that it's not a purple Landing Zone. I could have swore. The purple zone right think they drop their like it's an orange Zone. Yeah, and I think and I think we talked a little bit beforehand, but I think one of the main reasons why it is such a good drop zone. Is that even though it might not have the best quality gear? It has the most quantity of gear. So you might not get you might not get your purple armor. You might not find like an orange helmet, but you will get a lot of it. So if you do find Shield cores, you're going to find a lot of them. You're going to find a lot of Medics you're going to find some gun and a good amount of ammo and then kind of like our one story about how we got down in this skull town, you know, if you're able to survive that encounter, you can have like a lot to choose from you can have up to like, you know anywhere from 15 to 20 death boxes should be like, what do I want?

It will feel less like you're hiding things and you will see much more confident and trustworthy do your research have your ducks in a row and lay it all out on the table a sample introduction for a first-year coach could sound like this. Hello everyone. My name is Whitney Bartok. And this is my first year coaching volleyball. Although I'm new to coaching. I started playing volleyball when I was in sixth grade and have been playing ever since while in high school. I worked at every summer camp and even LED Camp my senior year. What I loved about coaching during Camp was seeing the girls develop their skills and watching their enthusiasm for the Game grow. Although it's my first year coaching. I know that this program has been very successful in the past. I plan to build on those successes with an aggressive playing style which still develops the Er Team you should then go over team rules which is detailed in subsequent sections established travel plans the possibility for any additional travel uniform ordering if not already in place practice schedules and team policies. Once your presentation is done open the floor for questions. You should have addressed most of the topics which apply to everyone so you may get individual questions at this point note that you can discuss individual questions afterwards, so the group can be dismissed. If you do not already have it have sheets, which families can complete and pass around at the meeting for contact information follow the meeting up with an email summarizing your points and reiterating any questions, which you answer during the meeting one final note. Although I often refer to family members as parents throughout these Pages Please be aware that sometimes you may be communicating with Aunts Uncles grandparents legal Guardians step parents cousins. The list goes on and on I And being inclusive in your speech because not everyone will have a mom and dad as their primary support system. I prefer to use the term family as often as possible since this has always captured everyone who is a legal guardian for my girls. So despite my use of the term parents on occasion. Please note the family structure for your players before you say anything which exclude someone who cares for one of your girls more paperwork. I know I know you thought you were done with paperwork, but I have good news for you.	1.0

Like what we can't trust anyone else dive at you, but you mentioned Kevin why don't we talk about him for a hot second because we saw him as Iceland. I lamented last episode. We just see him standing outside with Josie as Archie pulls up. I'll bring His father home and that was it. No words. Nothing said just with his arm around Josie and there we go. Now we get to find out what happened over the summer that pretty much nobody spoke to him. Hmm. I the only one that would even say hello back to him would be Fang and that was through text and so he is claiming that yeah, he's worked on himself. He realizes he doesn't need the farm but he does need his friend. So he's trying to mend fences with Betty, but he still seems untrustworthy.	0.0

So so opiates there are several nervous system depressant. So people think they called an overdose emergency by this actually respiratory emergency like it's going to decrease your Drive so much. You're going to be very slow respirations to know respirations. So when we talk about signs and symptoms, those are a lot of the signs that we looked at. We looked at what's their breathing rate is going to be like eight respirations and minute or less or not reading at all. Now they're going to be signed on if it'll be blue in the lips pale blue. The fingertips could be very sweaty or die Frederick it go to be little bit of vomitus or foam in there are way as well and then the pinpoint people sort of are the other tell Tale sign right there is what some crews are seeing now. They're seeing some other drugs on board that are really they're still keeping them depressed. So we're giving them the locks on and it's knocking off the little bits off of your opiate receptors and blocking it appropriately where it should be but the people are still saying depressed from another drug on board so I can benzodiazepines and other things like that. So, What what we're seeing now with that is that still that respiratory emergency like you we can't forget that we need to breathe for these people on all oxygenate them and then transport them. So in our back to our kits and suffering of that were teaching is we follow this the save me campaign so stands for stimulate Airway ventilate evaluate your medication and then evaluate again, so we want to stimulate try and get them. Awake painful stimulation see if they respond at all. They don't respond. Then we go into the airway. So we're opening their Airway. Then we're going to be ventilating because it's that central nervous system depressant is depressing their respiratory drive and we want to auction auction them and breathe for them. We want to breathe one breath every five seconds for them and we can keep them alive and keep them sustained by breathing for them without even giving them logs on fruit and then after that then I'll give more value eight if there's no real response and we get into her medication and then at that point we will be administering your first story dose of point for intramuscular. So we taught everybody had a breakdown feels drawn up properly and landmark throw it in a few other Miss like that people think need to expose the scan. You can't you can go right through the clothing if you have to sew in the deltoid or the thighs the best spot as well.	0.0

Like what's yeah, I think to like just know that it's it's a legitimate real struggle and it's okay like you're not inconveniencing anyone you're not you know, like I think two people are like I'm so sorry. I'm a And it's like that's but that's part of you. That's all of you. You know that the good the bad the not so good and I think like if you can't take me with my the best of me you're at can't take the well, well they say with if you can't have the worst of you can have the best of me kind of right have you got it's all the all makes you part of it, you know, like for us to like some of that achieving that anxiety kind of helps us to achieve more and the you know me like worrying about people and caring that makes me really caring person. So there are aspects of anxiety that are good. I think it's just when it gets out of control and it becomes like a train that just won't stop and you can't make it.	1.0

Actually those houses is really nice not having to worry about okay and then not only that but then I can get kitted up enough where I'm like, hey guys, there's a you know, there's armor up here.

I just don't think it matched the song. I think if it was a different song that it went with it would have won. I just it didn't make sense as soon as soon as she came out. I get that she was trying to do something different and show a different side of Trinity, which is fine. Fine, and I you know, and I encourage it but it should have been done with it. Just it didn't make sense for the song. It really truly didn't I mean if you can explain it to me and justify it I will take everything that I'm saying right now back, but you can't because it didn't fit the song. She didn't even like this in her 20s, at least she was in just in a dance costume and she just danced and she roll at least she rolled on the floor when they said you spin me right round like it made slack. I'm not saying it was phenomenal, but it just didn't it didn't work for me.	0.0

Yeah having the having the redeploy. Once again kind of just means you can kind of take your you could take your time. You don't have to worry too much and you can either go to the redeploy or you can go to that thing just to the South which was the overhanging bunker and then boom there's Cascades right there Cascades is the mid-tier and it also has the redeploy right there. So no matter where even if the circle is going all the way down to like Thunderdome like you can really take your time in that area. I think that's what's so enticing about is no matter where the circle is going.

The beginning of the season has a lot of formalities which need to take place including meeting with the families of your team and setting expectations establishing team rules ordering uniforms Mr. On the bright side. You actually get to start practice which is why you are drawn to coaching in the first place right meeting the parents meeting. The parents can be an intimidating situation unless you are from a small town where everyone knows Is everyone you'll be going into this meeting with no idea what personalities you'll encounter from. The get-go. Everyone will be extremely friendly. Most of them will be just as excited. As you are about the upcoming season will be eager to hear your plans for the team. However, this doesn't mean you can go into the meeting totally relaxed. And without preparation families will have questions for you. And the ones who will ask you questions are the ones who are not concerned with sugar coating their enquiries. This is why you try to address many of these Topics in a welcome speech / presentation. So you give off the vibe of being prepared and that you are fully capable of leading their daughters. Here are some examples of the questions. You might be asked at your first meeting of the year.	1.0
Yeah. So Mom Dukes was like I got to find your father and you know, and and she tracked him down and You know, I'd look it's spitting image of this guy.

So he's he had just had her and you know went to his house where he was staying with his girlfriend at the time, so I went over there. The next day went over there and hung out and it was just I remember was just like a odd feeling because you know, I had built up had so much resentment and anger at that point, even though I was only 12, but I was I guess I opened myself like I let me see what this is about and then you know, two three days later. That was it. You know, he just went back into the Shadows.	0.0

So today it's gone up forgotten that it was going up and I forgot we were playing at two o'clock. So whenever 5 and I didn't put my match review of you don't think yeah, I've now but I think people would probably confused. So it was like it's going through all of his greatest moments at the club.

We're going to do some question and answer Q Benes stuff like that. Just just to make us grow like, so one time we we are talking about how we can take care of our physical. Yeah or of our physical body so and Crossfit back then was getting popular like 2013. That's where the sports became really big. Oh, those are dirty. Yeah. Yeah. Our church is really Pro into that. So it's not like spiritually, but of course mentally and physically there really are Moving the forward towards that direction. So CrossFit was really introduced to us by our church. Finally started. Right? Look I did not expect this.	1.0
All right now and I'm so glad you mentioned that because this is something that not only we need to be doing with our students, but we need to be teaching to our students. That looking people in the eye and saying hello Yeah, and it's amazing to me how much that effect can have on someone and I'm probably overly do this. I probably had annoyed the heck out of people a big city because I do now that I've got the travel a lot more with my career in education the way it is now like I go to DC quite a bit I go to I was in New Orleans last week I go to some big cities, right? I make a point no matter where I'm at to to look at people and say hello, and I know that one. Our parents have told us like all the time don't talk to strangers. Don't talk to me. But why not? You know, I'm not saying go get in a conversation with someone and tell them everything about your life. But when you're walking past them on the street. Hello. Hi. How's it going? How are you? You know I say hi to every single random person I passed and I get some really dirty looks I get the shaking of the head. Like, why are you talking to me? But why not? You know, why not just say hello. I mean, it's a simple simple thing when you're walking through a Lobby of a hotel Or when you I don't know. I know it seems like it should go without saying right but the do it and I get that this is educated for reached out to you here and obviously we sincerely hope you're doing that your students every day. I know all you amazing educators are saying hello to your students when they come in every day. That's that should go without saying but teach that to them why not teach your students to start doing that around the building for starters, you know instead of don't tell them to go out and just talk to every stranger they meet but say hello to every single person that passes them in the hallway or or on the playground or at lunch or in the office or on the bus hallway, cause there's no talking in the hallway screwed.	1.0
So a lot of people complained about the the cleaning diapers changing diapers wiping butts ugh 32 cleaning skid marks off my potty trained kids underwear because it didn't quite take that's good. Mom got mad says training to boy. Boys requires a lot of urine all around I'm frustrated you and me both Lacey more this morning. I was woken up at 5:30 to wipe my kids but from having diarrhea you Parenthood is just it's just fucking Sublime between 80 potty training is the worst. I read that celebs hire people to do it smart thinking there's no way they hire people to fucking potty-trained.	0.0
Yeah, it does goes from Cape Jervis across the bottom of the floor area up sort of near Victor Harbor, which is nearer we start at y pinga and and then it goes up through the Adelaide Hills generally. Then across right past Mount lofty and right up into like sort of not far from the Clare Valley and and then you end up it finishes in the Flint North and the Flinders ranges like up in the desert. And so obviously we just covered the bit down on the this south of Adelaide and so basically going from wiping out to kaipo Forest for those who are not from here that doesn't really make any sense, but locals know all about About it. And first thing I will say if you're not from here, this is like becoming a really good 100K race. Like I've seen it grow over the time that I've been doing it and Ben Hawkins is the race director and who sort of the founder of ultrarunners essay and he's also a very good friend of mine. He has just he put his heart and soul into these races and he he goes he was so he was a crook as a dog on the day he could barely speak. Because he had and his wife is 38 weeks pregnant and he was there at you know, and he just from from Son Well Before Sunrise and too well to the very last Runner came in, you know, like he just you know, they'd lose race directors work hard and then also that the rest of the team like been pieman, pardon me and and Michelle Hanlon and probably a bunch of names. I'm going to forget plus all the a station volunteers. They all everyone just works really hard. At this race and this year was the best year. So anyway, I took off really fast. I'm running along I get to the first style to step over the thing so and hang on. Hang on.	1.0
I just feel like the Beehive I thought they did great but I feel like they're like little little gimmicks overshadowed like they're emceeing a Lil Bit whereas I feel like black holes they did a great job of kind of incorporating their themes and their themes not overshadowing their emceeing I guess that's what I'm trying to say, but they did they both did great and so I'm glad either one of them would one so I'm happy with beehive wedding. So there I do think that the black hole was built on Monet and Monique's personalities and the be high was built more on the concept. So I totally I totally agree with you there.	1.0

This is for us absolutely and it's actually funny because when we did get the call that we're going to be on Dancing With the Stars the first thing was They called me in there like Daniella we have great news and we have not-so-great news. And the first thing they said is Basha is going to have a celebrity partner the season and I was like, oh my God, that's amazing. That's the best news ever and then they're like, well this season we just won't have one for you this season, but you know, it's we hope you can still like be okay with him being like are you kidding me this doing Dancing with the Stars? Absolutely like the fact that we're just here together and Bosh. It's too like we're both living this together. It's we're in this together. So whether I have one or he has one, it doesn't matter. It's where a family and the fact that we're we can both live.	1.0
She's like this is like literally the most is like me telling everyone that she like slept with 73 people in one night.

She's like no, I'm like, yeah. We're the only ones in here like it was not me last night. Like I did you eat this and you're like, oh my God, I'm freaking out. I don't remember like I was so drunk and I'm like you ate that and she was like freaking out and like could not believe she had Dairy but obviously her intuition was telling her that she needed that ice cream right then.	1.0

It just feels like we're hanging out as friends, you know, so it's been really fun and also on the days off that we don't have anything. We like to just come into the studio and just keep practicing our Basics and perfecting them. So when they do need us, we always look like the best that we can possibly start all the time. So no matter what we always have an agreement that we show up to the studio and we practice as much as we can together so that lets say for the opening number if they need us they call us and we're ready to go at any	1.0

Nice. Yeah order 66 was like a bad guy said hey Execute Order 66 and all of these army men are all these Troopers clone troopers. Has ended up killing all the Jedi, you know, so like unexpectedly like a betrayal. That's basically Order 66.	0.0

Right? And I think it's interesting because first of all like a Navy a how we have to have like an individualized plan for every person based on their needs whatever it is, but that and also it makes me think of when we talk about validity and as we know validity is the idea is something NG men measuring the relevant Dimension that you intended to measure so right so like I might be like, oh my God, she is so healthy. She's so skinny. Right? Like I'm thinking that they're right her body looking a certain way that that indicates that she's healthy, but that's not really a valid measurement. Right? Like that's not valid if I'm measuring someone's like level of Health. However, you plan on measuring it it wouldn't be there skinny. Like when I think about it after I was hospitalized and so sick. I lost 25 pounds. I felt sexier than ever. But I was at my most unhealthy point of my entire life. I mean, you know, like everything was wrong with me. And so, you know to try measure like, oh she must be healthy. She lost 25 pounds. She's so on her shit, right? Like little did they know my fingers are falling off in the background or whatever is going on that. I'm sorry. I had c-diff or you know, like your body is completely out of whack at that point. So I think that's an interesting site on validity in terms of what we think measures. Health or what? We thinks measure someone having their life together or you know, and it's not actually that at all.	0.0

I was like a junior. This kid was a senior. He had like a big party for his graduation and everyone was drinking. I wasn't the only one and a lot of I a lot of Vermont parties. I remember being in high school and cops coming to all of our parties. Is that just like a Vermont thing or did that happen to you too? It happened in college, but This happened in high school for us like in the middle of the woods in high school. Like I can only think of one time cops came and I'm trying to think of like what I did like it wasn't it wasn't anything that like wasn't handled like we were outside and they basically were like stop drinking like we have a ghoul can annoy. It was like a noise complaint like a neighbor called and said it was too loud. But like they never checked if anybody was drinking know there was like multiple parties. I got breathalyzed at in high school. Seriously. Yeah, that did not happen to me. I know that was like a thing and people like me that's why I like Hitler. It sounds bad that like not a drinking ticket underage. Whatever whatever but like it was so common. Like it happened to like a handful of people. I know not everybody but I happen to be one of them are just special. I am special help. So how I got the drinking ticket it was A friend's graduation party, he was a senior and he you know graduating high school. He had a big party a bunch of people from different ages went like this is like a pretty big. I remember it being a lot of people there and the cops show up and everybody like this is such a typical like Vermont thing. I know you all can relate like we just like all run in the woods like this was like the thing for Grant away. Oh my God, this was like a thing. Like we all just ran like ran into the woods. We slept into the abyss like and I was just like following somebody but like sis was so drunk. She couldn't like keep up solo me and like my like, I don't even know I was like trying to keep up like trying to hang beer in my hands like running. I'm wrong. I was like I got this I was like I got this And then of course, of course it was like I can't remember who I was with. I think I was like with some guy but we got caught and the cop was like come this way with me and you know, I was always taught that if a cop, you know catches you running you, don't try to fight it you just go along you go with him you apologize and that's what I did. So we went with him was like a group of like five kids and like we were the only girl So yeah, Jesus.	0.0

Everybody up just our I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot down a line real brief with it. Just all top because it's so many to name her like I can see like the I can talk on and off ever so high but I won't I was just like just be real brief just the ones I think of off top and then I'll just name a few that I feel like never get the credit. They deserve that I think is really good as well. But I'll start off you got to start off with the Fuji Quincy Jones like Quincy Jones. We talked about Quincy Jones When you talk about his Netflix, Joining, right mmm, but I like how you didn't even know that he produced no saying a lot of different stuff. Like when I was talk about the Austin Powers and it's my party and all that type of stuff. Like a lot of people didn't know about that. You know, a lot of people don't know about the Michael Jackson stuff. The Quincy Jones had his fingers in a lot of shit got though Quincy Jones our IP J. Dilla course, no saying probably my favorite of all time. Probably just the way he the way he laid laid his chops and stuff down was like some shit. Brilliance for like people still can't figure out how you did some of the city due to this day with that. Mpc2000 DJ Premier and other one 9th. Wonder who's my personal favorite right now Riza. Well, I think never gets the credit. He deserves, you know with the Wu-Tang dr. Dre, of course Timberland, if you're not if you're not aware of some of the shit that tamerlan did man like everything from Missy to live to Justin Timberlake North and Nelly Furtado like you name Timberland for someone who's the dude for real? And then I throw in Kanye now, I'll just I'll stop right there. It was a because it's just a lot of different people like I could like opt like people that don't people don't check for as much I believe that Big crib is a dope producer that people don't talk about nothing crisis who's with the soul council with 9th Wonder and I'm he don't get talked about he got some hot shit. It a lot of different people man. Not that's another one that I checked for. What about Hindus to do them? Gz beats and trap beats shorty red Shawty red on the trail. He used to do some hot shit man. Like Todo Jones was hot man. That's a lot of people Mannie Fresh. He was another one I can think of this is a lot of people mantid. You could just go on for hours talking about producer.	1.0
Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Fan into flame podcast. I'm your host as always Tyler warfel. Thanks for coming back and listening to another episode on this episode. We're going to give our season recap of the Fall Sports season, which were tremendous really historic seasons for our volleyball and soccer teams. We interview the soccer Captain's Christian Josh and Auggie. We also interview the volleyball seniors Amanda and Renee. We did have a slight audio malfunction during the soccer interview in my iPad fell over but we decided to just roll. That starting with soccer the boys won the dvcac championship for the second straight year by beating Chestertown again this time by a score of 3 to 2. In my opinion. This was the best of the Championships since we've been back in the dvcac the last four years. We've played Chestertown each of those four years. The first year was 2016 and we'd split with them in the regular season. I kind of thought we were the better team Alex scored an early goal in that game, but Chestertown scored to kind of flew key goals. The first one was just kind of a bad mistake barkeeper. / and the second one was a little controversial in that it was a long shot from near the corner. It looked like the ball might have gone out of bounds in the air and then come back in regardless. It was enough to give Chestertown a 2-1 win the next year in 2017. I don't think there's a question that we were the better team. We had beaten them for 1 and 5 3 in the regular season, but the game got kind of ugly there were lots of fouls going around the final score ended up being 4-3 in overtime. But three of the goals were scored on penalty kicks to from us and one. Them there just wasn't really a good flow to the game which in my opinion gave Chestertown the advantage in that game and to their credit. They took advantage in one in overtime last year, even though the final score was two to one. I feel like we kind of dominated the game Chestertown scored late to make it a one goal game. But as a fan at least it didn't really ever feel like we're going to lose. It was a great atmosphere great environment IDE Turf a lot of fans a night game under the lights great atmosphere, but we scored early and pretty much control the play. Why this year was different? Like I said from a fan perspective. I think this was the best game. I think the teams were very evenly matched. They both played. Well Augie scored in about the 10th minute to give GMS a one nothing lead, but Chestertown pressed up and scored a nice goal about 15 minutes later the tied at 1-1 and it looked like they really had the momentum at that point heading into halftime and looked like we kind of needed to regroup but right before halftime Augie worked a little magic. You dribble between a handful of Chestertown Defenders and scored about a minute. With a half-time whistle to give GMS a two to one lead. That was a huge goal to get the momentum back on our side but Chestertown came out in the second half continue to press continued to play well and they found another equalizer with probably about 25 minutes left in the game. They got a long throw in from either Corner found an unmarked man for a header to tie the game at 2-2, but with 10 or 15 minutes left Auggie again dribbled past a few Defenders got into the box and got tackled from behind for a penalty kick which he converted pretty easily in the To the upper left corner, and that would be the final score it ended three two, there were some nervous moments at the end Chestertown kept attacking and had several good chances, especially on set pieces and Corner kicks, but our defense held on Christian had a really strong game. David was really good in gold and I think you had other Defender step up and play well and not make mistakes. I thought between Austin and Kobe and I thought Adam and Cody did a good job, too of not making any defensive errors. There were a few Corner kicks that were a little worried. With Chestertown players that were unmarked but overall the defense gave a really good performance. So it was a really exciting game. We had a lot of fans support despite the fact that it was a Saturday afternoon on the day of the Fall auction and not a very short drive up to bear. So it was a good day for GM s soccer a great way to end a really good season boys finished with an overall record of 13 wins one loss and 1 tie this season. They were 9 and 1 in conference play and obviously dvcac soccer overall. Is not the highest level of play, but I think it's improving and there weren't as many blowouts this year as in the past couple of years Chestertown Calvary and Faith Baptist were all pretty competitive. But in the three non conference games, we went to wins and 1 tie combine this year and last year and you have a two year record of 29 wins one loss into ties with to conference championships. That's really impressive and it's actually the best two-year run in GMS soccer history, and I think it just speaks to the job. Mr. Bechtel has On as a coach in building a program and there's been some really talented soccer players the last several years and some of that have been kind of unexpected. You know, Alex Augie and Christian all transferred to GMS for high school and didn't go here during elementary and middle school. So it's always nice to be able to add that level of ability into your program when you don't necessarily see that coming from the Middle School team. Then you also have Caleb and Joshua Lee who are also very talented soccer players that have been at GMS since kindergarten and throw in David Mendez into that mix too. But what's impressive about what the soccer program is a right now is that you get a lot of production from guys. You wouldn't necessarily consider themselves soccer players. You can see the Improvement of skills year by year from guys like Kobe and Ryan and Carson and Adam guys. It didn't really grow up playing soccer. But Mr. Bechtel gets the best out of them and to me that's the sign of a program that's here to stay and speaking of that. This is this team has no seniors. So they'll return to everyone from a team that just had Tremendous season to look for another big year and in our leg there aren't a lot of seniors Chestertown only graduates to Calvary just one and Faith Baptist doesn't have any seniors either so look for next year to be a really competitive year in the dvcac and I know that like worship rep who's kind of the top dog in the easyacc has seen some of our scores last couple of years. They want to play us next year. So next year could be a lot of fun for our soccer team will wrap up soccer with some awards because we've placed first in the regular season. Mr. Bechtell got to select seven of his players to play in the dvcac All-Star Game this year Junior's Augie Pacheco Christian quillin, Austin, swartzentruber Carson UNC and Josh Willie were selected along with sophomore David Mendez and freshman Nevin Yahtzee for Christian and Josh. It was their third All-Star selection for Austin for Augie. It was his second and for Austin Carson David and Nevin, this was their first time playing in the game Augie Christian Josh and Devon were additionally named to the all-conference. The team which is the best 11 in the conference and that's a really high honored to be named that team. We have posters that we make for the all-conference players. They'll be hung up at school sometime in the coming days. Augie was given medals for being the leading goal scorer and the leader in assists in the conference during the regular season and Josh was given one for leading in assists. He and Augie tied Atop The League for most assists a few other statistical leaders that weren't recognized at the All-Star games, but just throw these out there David Mendez was six in the league in goals. With seven which is impressive because he mostly plays goalie. Christian quillin was seventh in assists with for Carson Yahtzee with 18 goals with 6th and 10th and assist with three Nevin Yahtzee was 7th and assist with for and 11th in goals with four and then obviously all he led the league in both goals and assists 21 goals 11 assists and that's just in conference play Josh tied for first in assist with 11 and was 16 goals with seven. So that's a wrap on soccer. Make sure to come back next year and watch Team that we return everyone and some exciting things could be happening next year for our soccer team Auggie is just two goals away from becoming just the eighth player in GMS history to score 50 or more goals and Josh is just one assist away from joining Auggie in the 25 assist Club. Joshua be the seventh player in program history to have 25 or more assists look for that early in the season. All right. I'm joined Now by Christian. Hey, Josh and Auggie captains of the soccer team. You guys had a great season last year you had two of the all-time greats here Alex you leading assist of all time and EMS history killed the leading goal scorer all time. You lost them to graduate from last year and yet you still managed to have a great season. What did you have to do this season to make up for the losses of those two guys.	1.0

Like I know that when I go to the gym and work out with weights do things I actually feel a hundred times better. My anxiety is a hundred times better. It's not so when they said well, what's how do you find motivation? I'm like, it's more that I really just enjoy this. I'm not like having to look. Outside of myself to find the motivation the motivation is actually within me because of the way it makes me feel right the consequences that come after it during it also like I don't look at it as like to go to the gym. I look at it as like this is my time to show up for me and knowing that it's probably benefiting my body like not even physically of how I look but like internally like my heart muscle, you know, like things like that. It's so much more than just.

Yeah, man, that's that's huge when people like I don't think people know how rewarding it is that when someone that don't even speak the language no every word of your song and appreciate your music. That's crazy. Like a lot of people think that's weird here. Like somebody come over here ramp rapping in French or something like that or Germany, like what the hell is that?

You think I should start off with I think you know having a combination of three things of doing some type of cardio some type of dynamic stretching and static stretching combination of both and also doing a combination of compound lifting and functional things is important. So an example for you, you know would be someone more from 5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill elliptical or StairMaster do a little bit of Mobility routine loosen up your hips because you down a lot loosen up your back foam roller. Been about 15 20 minutes on that. So look about 30 minutes of warming up where your body is, like actually sweating before you do workout and the great dead great compound exercise or deadlifts just important that you keep your spine neutral and I would definitely if there's one workout that I would like you to start doing it would be dead lifts, like straightening your back straight to New York or your glutes. It's a full body workout. So you're not a lot of birds with one stone with that one movement. I just got to make sure you do it correctly and then like a lot of stability core exercises and the cardio, you know, it's not again. It's you know, it's not about intensity is just about consistency, you know, you know that you know how to track your calories. You're pretty good at that quick question.	1.0

Okay, I'll buy that so I'm glad that she's doing this but then I'll ask you first. What do you think of Charles? Do you think he's he's like, he seems too good to be true.

So yeah, I'll tell mine then you tell your next one and then I'll tell my next one. I'm going to start off with a college story. So I had a couple girlfriends my I think it was like my sophomore year of college and we I want to say it was like st. Patrick's Day or something like that. Maybe it wasn't I could be making that up but we all like got super dressed up like curled our hair like put a bunch of makeup on like how to hot outfit we frickin wore heels like we were doing the damn thing and one of my roommates from college we will call her. I don't know. We will call her Mary that way marriage a week Mary. That wasn't her name. But we're going to call her Mary. So Mary had a friend will call this friend Bethany. So Mary had a friend named Bethany and we saw a couple of my girlfriends and Mary who was my roommate we went to this party. Like it was like this big thing. And so I we got to this party and you're having a great time. You know, we were we were all drunk as fuck living our best life's I would do anything to go back to those days, but maybe not and so Mary's friend Bethany. Are we following along Mary Mary?	0.0

I've got talked about this last but I think it's actually it's a good segue since you mentioned the day or so and Tommy Boy situation. Now this new just came today, but the original story from a few weeks ago our boy Kanye West has been in a legal battle with Rockefeller and Emi who has been signed with since 2003 Kanye West with the Timothy to gain his ownership of his music and receive unpaid royalties, but now the news has come around that's mr. Kanye West has sold his soul and you know, I mentioned that he was with the Amana 2003 but his contract got extended in 2010, but according to this contract and I'm going to read what it says here and I can read the whole thing, but But verbatim it says at no time during the term. Will you seek to retire as a songwriter recording artist or producer or take any extended Hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing your musical career and the same basic manner issue in for sued such career to date. So what that means is that if Kanye loses his battle this man still can't retire like that's that's just wild this is wild. After all it is your trying to get ownership of your music Emi Rockefeller on it. You're trying to get unpaid royalties and they like well, okay no matter what happens. You can't retire bread according to this contract. So it's just another one of those situations where you're not reading fully what's going on or you are reading and you're just willingly signing over everything that you own and everything that you work for. These companies are shady man. And it just it sucks. I know that we made for The Kanye Kanye gun some wild stuff especially last year alone, but I don't want to hear this from anybody. I don't want to hear anybody trying to fight to get ownership of their music and then end up being a Slave at the end of the day because of some loophole or something that the artist did not look at before they actually signed a contract or signed the extension. So, how do you feel about this whole situation with Kanye?	0.0

Okay at this point. Gone, like if I'm genuinely fearful for my life while I'm waiting the treatment of the show. I'm pretty much sure I'm going to do it. Yeah, so I know there's another one we did last year where we are on the back of the boat, and we wanted to test this Blood myth where you know, sharks can smell a drop of blood in 10,000 legs of ocean. And so we went to the Bahamas and there was 25 feet of water with tiger sharks bull sharks hammerhead sharks nurse sharks everywhere and we drained half a liter of My Blood Out It into a bag and I jumped off the back of the boat and swam away and then ripped open the bag. I was surrounded by this huge plume of my blood just to see what would happen in hindsight that doesn't seem very clever. It was kind of fun.	1.0

So basically the secondary plot and the up	1.0
Well II I train a lot In the Heat of the is it gets very cold here in the scenic real during winter and it's actually quite cold still here at night and in the morning, but during the day it's can get very warm especially in summer. I can only run after I drop my daughter off at school. I've have my own business and work from home. So normally I get up super early do some work dropped off at school. They both of my run after 9:00. And so it's really hot but even so the weekend Is so but but I guess I just know to really take it easy. I just dialed it back. I kind of knew what I was in for hate liars. That's not to say I didn't feel it. I've I did think I drank 17 made this place of water throughout the day went. Well, this is yeah, but that's not an exaggeration. Yeah, I just took it as slow and I just knew I just I guess I didn't know what I was doing for in terms of the weather. Yeah. I saw a lot of people. People really suffer. I felt terrible for them. It was a it was a hard day, but it was a great day still the bodies were fantastic at the checkpoints. The organizers did such a great job. Yeah.	0.0

Well, I will tell them the story of me joining a second gym because because of that so I go to boot camp gym now. Love it, but for me, I am a burn time a bar lover and I kind of a behind my husband's back this week. And I joined about a local bar studio that Alpha also offers yoga and So currently I can't go see my therapist because she's got some stuff going on and we probably will be back for a month or two. So I'm in my mind. I was like, well, I'm going to try a new form of kind of self helping myself and I'm gonna do Yoga three times a week to see if I can kind of like Get Out of My Head learn how to like take deep breaths and really focus on the important things and just kind of have that me time. That's not not like going to the like another gem. This is like truly like a mind-body connection type of a thing. So report back on it. I'm going to go to my first yoga class next week I'm signed up to do it. So but it's like I think it's those things. It's like what can you do like, you also have to think outside yourself like, okay. Well, I've tried this. This doesn't work. Can I do something else do I think that will help and I so I'm going to try this for a few months and see if we'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I mean it's not going to hurt anything. So if anything it makes me feel stretchy, so right.	1.0
Especially Wizards.	1.0
Yeah, and I think it's also incredibly disenchanting and a huge part of my audience is you know, there are atheists that are genuine atheists and there are quote unquote atheists that are just really hurt Christians and I see both and I don't you know, I don't say they're always one or the other but that does exist and the reason is because also we're told that every good good thing happens because we're involved in church and because we're being perfect and we're saving ourselves and we're honoring our husband and we're listening to our leaders and tithing and when you're doing all that and you're in a sexless marriage or in my case, like you find out your husband was cheating on you and it rocks your world like then all of a sudden you're like wait all of these things that were supposed to protect me that I have been doing right, you know, like I used to Like the girl to find girls and that's why I harp on them so much for anyone listening. That doesn't know Nicole and I are both YouTubers. So there's this whole life Christian space of YouTube, which is very Niche but it's so funny thing always get recommended to me too.	0.0
Then I will clean out the bathtub now. I like to use a tool with a handle on it so that I don't have to bend as much and I will wipe out the bathtub and you know, rinse it out with that scrubber that has a handle on it and but I will say this. Sometimes I would keep a dish wand in the bathtub like the Scotch-Brite just one that has that receptacle in it.	1.0
That's all probably all for that reason. I'll probably go tasuku Shack. Let's go shopping. You sure he's good. Yeah, he could just bury it but he didn't even catch a cold if you Perry's everything away before Peru. Yeah keeping goal. I go Sam Ricketts right back Mary Douglas.

Well it to me, it sounds I didn't hear John William. So I think that strong consideration has to be given to Jonah Williams. Now my consideration there with Williams is that I know that there's not a lot of concerns with him being able to move to the right side, but I think he's best suited as a left tackle. Now a lot of those skills are translatable. However, that doesn't mean every single player can go from one side to the other and Not entirely sure, you know that they want to try and do that. It kind of depends. I I think if they take if they take Williams, I think that that's a that's a luxury pick for them at that point. But how about you go through maybe the top ten that draft network has there that at 12 basically?	1.0

Now I have one other thing. I don't know if this is about intuitive eating but this is just about me and I look at it behaviourally in terms of response effort, which response effort is. Exactly what it sounds like your response takes a lot of effort. So like you would always amazed me when we lived together. Like you'd be like filtering your own water system making your own milk to put on top of your like veggie. You're like oats in the morning or like your Chia what puddings I don't even know and I'm like this chick is so not lazy. Like it amazes me is like so like I what do you recommend? Doing because I find a problem also. Why okay, this is I know this isn't maybe not intuitive. I like why it's easier to eat unhealthy for example, or like maybe you're not even listening to yourself intuitively because you're honestly doing what is easier at the moment and like the easy options are like have you ever gone on a road trip and like tried eating healthy along the way it's really like it's like, oh my God, I'm gonna try be healthy. I'm gonna get Plain potato chips right like or I'm gonna get this bar that is essentially filled with so much crap or whatever it is because it's a matter of response effort to like you. I remember actually you want a way with people some words like some music festival or something. We're in Austin and like you packed all this food and like that seems like so much effort to me that I feel like it also does make like I don't know if I'm not necessarily listening to my Intuition or I'm just like doing what's easier.	1.0
Jewel Ocwen the pick after Brian Burns. He went to Miami got it. So the quarterbacks really kind of check out. So I'll do the top top seven prospects that are not right now. No elephant is the top of the board DeAndre Baker from Georgia is to a corner AJ Brown is third from Mississippi Nasir Adderley is fourth safety from Delaware and the Packer Legacy. Jerry Tillery is V from Notre Dame Eric McCoy from Texas AM Jonathan. Abram is number 7 from Mississippi State and though that's your top seven currently. Peggy's I think fans. It just makes too much sense if he is there a 30 to make the pic he couldn't he's the souped-up version of what your Michael Finley was and I think he'd be a stone-cold solid player for years and years and years and Green Bay Pleasant, you get the fifth year option for a tight end, which is always a good thing.	1.0

Oh my gosh, I I actually have a blank on this one. I think maybe two sides of the coin from a client's perspective. This may not be answering your question directly Jake but from a client perspective their perception of home staging it could be quite an expensive investment or them and they might not want to spend that money to Stage a home to sell but then on the flip side. The home stages I guess wanting to come into the industry that it isn't there is so much more Blood Sweat and Tears involved in in home staging then just, you know, making a bed and fluffing pillows. Yeah, there's so much more involved. I think that's probably all I can give you at them.	1.0

So like there was no hanging out with the tree unless as a kid, maybe you want to hang out in there or like after the fact we're all the presents are under you're hanging out with the presents and stuff.

No, so, I recently I had to do the packing. So my wife obviously we've talked about this. It's a no-fly zone when it comes to packing the kids for any trip. I'm relegated to one. Shutting the hell up at all. So why don't you just basically my wife does all the packing I can't do anything. I can't touch anything. That's great. It is good except for Thanksgiving this past Thanksgiving where my wife was like, you know, what because she didn't join us the whole Thanksgiving so you went early. No we went together, but my wife and my daughter came back to the city and then write for the ballet my other two kids. Yeah. We I stayed on for another few days. So she's like it's show time.

So in order to find security in God, you need to stop finding Security in everything else right and worrying about everything else will how is this going to happen? How did it end like stop wrestling against God and let him show you who he is right in chapter 15 Abraham and Abraham believed the Lord and the Lord counted him righteous because Of his faith not by his Good Deeds, but by his belief in who God is and and that he would be faith that God would be faithful in his promise right not worrying about the details of when just acting in obedience and being faithful to God when we ask God for something and have to wait we can be tempted to take matters into our own hands and then it interferes with God's plans. Right? Like I know for sure and I call this like a detour Because I opened a studio when I knew I rushed into it. God was not calling me to that at all II like instantly had anxiety. I was stressed like in those things do not come from the Lord right? But this was early in my faith when I did man when I was just striving for achievements and I thought I had to earn God's love. I thought I had to like like accomplish things in order to earn his Van earned his blessings, right? I took matters into my own hands all the time all the time. I wasn't allowing myself to be still it because I really didn't truly know who God was because I wasn't in in deep relationship with him because I was trying to be in control of everything.	1.0
You don't remember me you like this more than what she wore last week. What was she wearing them? Speak the maroon with the red hair the jumpsuit that was boring, huh?

Be alright, it's being it's been an example to indict and just letting your students watch you WEA know wholeheartedly these kids mimic every single thing we do. So imagine if if you smiled and said hello to every person across your path, you know, we talked to think in one of the previous episodes about getting kids to to learn the names of other staff members, right? And I mean, that's something that could be considered a kind act when you can call someone by name rather than just just waving or giving a head nod, you know, so that's a simple step. Inclusion is another big one and I don't mean on the the classroom inclusion of you know, different grade levels and abilities and it just including people in your everyday conversations. I just think that's an important lesson we can teach to all kids that we include people who might not feel included you'll see that in bullying statistics all the time. What if you know, what if what if what if one person had someone sit with him at lunch or that one person that someone sits on the playground so kindness as a whole can be stretched in Seoul The different directions and so many philosophies and so many ideas or things but it doesn't have to be the purchase of an item or an idea that your intently doing. It just just just be a good human being, you know, the way that the way that you would want to be treated, right?	1.0
Well the sir. Bicoastal, so I started at Burma gooey and I end it at Eden. So the distance from biggity-boom Acuity or even is around 45 minute drive. I have gone further up the coast path / McGeary to town called narooma and down many which is kind of a little bit further than that 45 minutes, but that's probably the proximity because any further and removalist costs as you would know increase so I try and keep A bit in that Circle.

Yeah, so she's a good runner and she where does she live again? She lives like a good runner. She's putting a little yes the phenomena and she's crazy. Yeah, not very and again humble and and friendly and she likes my band. So the leather pleasure toys. So for those of you that are familiar with episode that was about me you'll know all about that. She listened and she's a fan and so what can I say? I'm popular No, it's yeah now right come on great chat.

So if you absolutely hate doing CrossFit, but you think you should because it's trendy and everyone's doing it. You're not it's going to feel like a punishment. But if you decide that you just like biking outside and that's just your exercise and it makes you feel strong and empowered in your body and you love being outside just do that and you never have to actually do CrossFit again, and I guarantee you you will show up to that bike ride way more. Fluently than you would to that CrossFit class.	1.0
Yep. There you go. Number three is the Thunderdome.

I'm going to assume that you have one two or three bathrooms. So you can either do each step in each bathroom simultaneously and just kind of run back and forth or you can pick one bathroom to deep clean and then just lightly straighten up the remaining bathrooms, but I'm going to talk you through cleaning a bathroom and there are there are less variables with about The room with the kitchen. I'm like, I don't know if you have a dishwasher. I don't know how many dishes you have to do and things like that, but how we clean our bathrooms is pretty straightforward.

Then cheers standing up value strategic play behaviors wanted Play calling Captain lead Huddle's reinforcements ask team to call a play and run it celebrate tips in open areas by understanding what you want out of your players. You are able to better communicate your expectations to them designing reinforcements ahead of time leaves only one task remaining implementation. Now try and come up with your own list bounce back and forth between your values and behaviors wanted then think of how you'll reinforce them. Consistency is key here. Make sure the reinforcements are something you can keep up with. Otherwise, the behaviors may not be consistent either. You might find that throughout the season you will add new behaviors to your wish list and you'll probably change some of your reinforcements if they aren't working and add new ones only change something if it absolutely does not work or if you find that you cannot keep up with it.	1.0
Getting the cross yesterday and we'll move on from that game all unless are you going to have just been really boring but atmosphere and yeah, I read kicked him in the are 12 and it's added on and we got the goal.

this week on Chompers its In charge week, what's in charge week? Well, it's about all the ways that people are in charge of stuff. So to start we've got a quiz about who is and isn't in charge.

I think we spoke to a few race directors on this podcast and I just I always I would I don't envy their position when the weather gets really hot and about There's been some races here in Adelaide with it. The race had to be cancelled when the temperature got I think it was forecast to be over 35 degrees. And that was this particular race. That was the cutoff point. When is that? We can't do it and people give it and I'm really good friends with this particular race director in the the cops. A lot of grief when he has to cancel the race, you know every yeah. Yeah, so I don't know why God have you ever been in a race where the weather has been so I mean obviously on the weekend, maybe go into more detail about that you drink 17 liters of water people suffered. Did you did it? Was it indicative of reflect your time you finish second. So like do you still remember on suffering equally it was a work day.	0.0

Everything is knowing that you know in any small way or any big way. I could have a positive influence on someone's life. You know, I feel like a lot of us haven't sometimes our judgment is cloudy. Sometimes we don't know why things are the way they are and so I just try to help increase my clients awareness and understanding the true problem and then going to the root and seeing how we can transform them internally and then eventually as we do that the external transformational just follow, you know, so it's more just about what are you doing day? Like, why do you why do people want to lose 10 pounds? Why do what people want to lose 30 pounds? But really it's Yes, it's a health decision. But it's also an emotional decision. Yeah, like good exactly. Right. It's a you know, what sometimes the opinions of others have like a huge role but I think the most important thing is your own opinion, you know, everybody's different. So what makes you happy is it losing 20 pounds? Is it getting a little bit stronger? Is it, you know increasing your self defense is it just being more functional, you know, everything's different majority of your clients.	1.0
So so I work like a 16-hour day. I came home. I was tired. I just wanted to you know throwing CNN and have a glass of wine go to sleep. And my wife was like Hey, you know, he's still up my son is still up and he was two years old and I was like I'll get to and she kept nagging me about it, and I thought to myself. At least I'm here, you know and then that thought kept echoing in my head because it of course I love my kids, you know, but I was just like damn where did that come from? You know, what does that mean? Like because obviously I like I love my kids more to love myself, but that's that's what kind of got me on that Journey but it's interesting what you say like with these statistics of now because and I touch on this in my book like when I was growing up, You are eyeball if you knew your father like I only knew two dudes who knew any fathers and we used to look at them like y'all weirdos. Yeah, you know and that's how much we had. We had rationalize that trauma and and I think that's a generational thing too. I think you know when you go back, I mean, we're not gonna go too far back, but let's just say from like Vietnam era right you go back then you got a lot of cats coming back home. They on drugs a lot of cats are going to jail and heroines hitting in then the 80s come around. You know for us it's like my mom always says like my generation is like yo, we did the Civil Rights thing y'all go get the bag. You know what I mean? It's like every generation has another thing so you have a lot of you know, a lot of us people my age would whether you college educated or not, you know the out there not just with jobs, but with some form of a career, you know, and they come from not having that think so. Everyone is like we're trying to reverse that cycle or break the cycle, you know what I mean?	0.0
I thought I was okay.	1.0
I think if we could go back we could have been a little a little bit looser with our promiscuity, you know in the thing is as we had very strict boundaries for what most people would say because well first of all, both of us were grown up adults and he had his own house and you know, he could have had me we could have been hanging out at the house, but that was one of our things we didn't go in the house together. Ourselves unless there was somebody there I most definitely did not go into his room whether he was there or not. I didn't go in his room. Like there was just some things that I felt like it was very clear boundaries. We weren't like laying down together on the couch. Like there was just things, you know, there's just things staying staying horizontal. No staying vertical don't stay here. Don't stay horizontal staying vertical, you know, while you're hanging out that's that's one way to make sure that certain things, you know. Staying pure and so we would say, you know, we look back on our dating and though we were very very strict, you know more than most people that you know, I don't know we can't really compare but probably very strict and in comparison to what most Christians would say that was their dating boundaries and I would say if we would go back we would definitely be more strict because the thing is you cannot steal something from marriage in your dating time and then be fulfilled fully like you're supposed to be in marriage the same.	0.0

I mean there were so many different aspects of it. You know, one of the aspects was this idea. Like I started viewing Christianity differently and I know a lot of Christians will probably disagree with this interpretation, which is totally fine. I just think it's important to realize that there are a lot of people out there. There who will hear the gospel message and they'll interpret it in kind of the way that I started seeing it and it's not necessarily always healthy because I remember looking back and you know asking myself like why I could never bring myself to get baptized even though so many people encouraged me to do it and I think part of me subconsciously disagreed with this idea of like dying to yourself like this. Idea that you are your intrinsic self needed to die that there wasn't anything like good about you. Unless God was living in you and you were reborn as Christ and it just seemed so hurtful to me and like looking back now. I don't think I ever felt broken enough to need a savior. My self-image wasn't bad enough like my life wasn't shattered enough for me to view myself. Business like dirty rags that God Compares artworks to in the Bible and this just kind of made me see how religion doesn't work as well. If you start out with a healthy amount of self-worth because then when I was going through harder times in life, I remember thinking how easy it would be to like go back to church and to feel better and you know, there would be so many people who would instantly care about And it give me attention and support and comfort me and try to make me feel better. And that was so appealing but it made me realize how this idea of God and religion could so easily be used as a Band-Aid like for our problems. It made me feel like religion was like preying on the weak and in those vulnerable moments, like it's so easy to want a savior, but I needed to like pull myself back into reality and be like Intellectually, though. This doesn't add up in my head. So like I don't know. I didn't want to take the easy way out and just like go back and then oh gosh, like there's just so much of out of this is how I felt but it's like you're not capable of anything without God and everything good is because of him and everything bad is because of you and like he deserves all the glory and you're just a vessel completely worthless without him and Like if you leave God your life will be miserable. And that's what I was always told and that's I think what really hurt me afterwards like when I was like, I don't believe this anymore like but people are still telling me like he needs to be the priority in your life. And like if he's not bad things will happen to you and like yeah this one time. Yeah like this one time my friend. I was telling her that I had filled out this job application and it was a writing application. So I had to write like a ton of like not essays but like a lot of prompts and then I hit submit and my internet had gone out and it got all deleted and instead of just being like yeah, that sucks like, you know the internet but she was like wow God is really trying to get you back and in my head I'm like God is going out of his way to like make my life miserable so that all come back to him like that doesn't make any sense. Like, how do you I don't know how can you think that way because that just sounded like manipulation.	0.0

Yeah, I'll go first. So I think anyone who probably knows me since I was a kid knows that Audrey was that anxiety girl the worrier and I grew up in the church and so a big Big part of my upbringing was you know, pray about it and you know, don't worry don't be anxious and have faith and all of that stuff is fantastic and amazing and it is helpful. But sometimes if you have a sinus infection or you have the flu you go get medicine to help you with that or you go see a doctor and so my anxiety kind of got to a point where it was really hard to even function where it was just like okay something is not right here. And so I would say probably probably in college is kind of when I finally was like, all right, this is not this is not normal like normal people don't get this worried to the point of you know, you can't even do new things or you can't function in life. And so I started first seeing a counselor and she was really really helpful. I think one thing about a counselor is they're awesome. But sometimes we kind of view them as like a Next it's like okay, I'm gonna fix it. But just like a car you don't get your oil changed once and then drive the car for 10 more years sure. So I think with anxiety different things in your life can kind of happen and it rears its ugly head. And so I think it's important to kind of know yourself and know what your triggers are and and acknowledge them and then not wait until things get really really bad before you try to get. Because it's just going to be that much harder to dig kind of dig out of it. Yeah, for sure. Yep.	0.0

Okay, so we covered two things in the meta first was that there was a lot of guard plane and a lot of the really successful competitors were guard players, but they were many successful top players to I don't mean to exclude them second as far as positions that we saw a lot of we saw a lot of half guard and Butterfly guard particularly from like lockers I should mention I didn't plan to mention this but we did see tons of inversions all weekend long. And what was interesting about the inversions and tells you that it's very clearly a part of the meta was that different styles of jujitsu were doing inversion. So we saw a Geo Martinez the 10th plant style both him and Elvira and Thor were all doing in versions. But then we also saw of course Paulo me out doing invert attacks. I think we saw Kennedy doing invert inversion attacks and some of the female competitors were I'm them too. And they all had kind of different purposes for doing them. Who was the guy that beat a Luca slippery. I have to check because I'm going to be people are gonna be mad if I forget his name, okay, it was Dante Leone. He maybe had the upset of the tournament. He beat Luca slippery and he did it with inversions. But his were more sort of traditional backed a conversions and I think he took Luke. He definitely took Lucas's back once he might have taken it twice, but he just had some bro. Inversions that he was working in a couple of his matches. So what that tells you is that inversions are useful for different competitors with different sort of game plans and strengths and weaknesses. So it's something to look into if you're playing more of an open guard game particularly. If you're like Locker another Trend that I noticed this weekend was how important the back attack was and what I notice in this is again something that as I was watching it. I kind of like asteroid like hey, are you seeing this a lot? Lot the last couple days, which is that competitors were really not interested in being in the mounts and they were very not interested in being in side control. I really shallow side control for more than a couple seconds 80cc. You didn't see a whole lot of guys working attacks from the mount everyone wanted the back to the point where a lot of people would not even pass card. They would they would try to attack the back straight from inside people's guard. That's where kind of law the inversions came along. And also what you saw when people hit takedowns is they would go straight from a takedown and they would try to get to the back within you know, as fast as they could they weren't interested in doing those traditional pit stops that a lot of you know blue and purple belts would do which is you know, stop at side control, you know, take a second consolidate your win and your points and then go to the next thing and then go to the next thing these guys wanted to go straight there. Now, this could just be kind of in a DCC thing. Thing again because of the to shoulder rule which is that you saw a lot of competitors that they were trying to keep their shoulders off the mat and in doing so maybe they expose their back and it's also possible that at this really high level a lot of people have figured out that it's just almost impossible to pass some of these guys and girls guards. So it's better for them to just try to attack leg locks and kind of chain that with taking the back interesting thing is that Keenan Cornelius did a podcast in the summer. On Flow grappling and he kind of predicted this he said that in this was, you know way before atcc and he said the way noogie grappling is shaping up right now. I think that passing the guard is going to become less and less important because people are just going to be attacking leg locks from the garden if that doesn't work. They're going to tries to go straight for back takes and I definitely felt like that was happening at a TCC. Also worth noting that the rear naked choke was the top finisher 80cc again. I think I'm going from memory. I think there were 35 submissions and nine of those were rear naked choke 6. While we're on the subject of numbers, which is one of our favorite things at high percentage. I think the order of submissions was rnc's was the first heel hooks where the second and then the third was Guillotines and I was actually was very pleased to see this because this really matches up with a lot of the data that we've collected we've shown that in noogie matches the top-performing submissions across all belt levels are rear naked choke so Guillotines armbars and Now atcc heel hooks are a hundred percent legal. So they're going to be much more represented. Some of the research that we've done has been across different formats where different kinds of leg locks were not always legal. So when you're at the high level basically if you hooks your legal, they're going to be very well represented. But you know, we also showed that Guillotines were really high percentage at the noogie level, even though in the ghee we have other data that shows that there are very very low percentage. And the last thing that was very much on meta that we saw at a TCC was bodylock takedowns. So this is really interesting because body luck takedowns in the data that we've done at high percentage are not really anything special most people get better results from single legs sacrifice throws or just leg trips. So I don't think bodylock takedowns is necessarily going to translate to other formats, but A TCC a great example. This was JT Torres, which is that there were other competitors and I saw this throughout the weekend that we're trying to get single legs. But because you had to get both shoulders on the mat if you just kind of visualize in your head what a single leg looks at, its your entire body versus one of their legs. That's the kind of Jiu-Jitsu aspect of it. But really that's only good for kind of getting there. But down on the mat. There's you are not going to have upper body control. You have to let go of the leg and sort of All up and we definitely saw that atcc. So the competitors that had a lot of success were people that were doing bodylock takedowns or we're doing that kind of like double Leg Takedown where you know you land right on their on their diaphragm on their chest and then you effectively have upper body control and those takedowns in my experience are pretty Advanced take down. So, you know, you saw that there were some really good wrestlers like JT Torres that could pull those off. then everyone else I think just wisely made the calculation that hey why why I'll just I'll get in the guard and I'll try to work my game and get in a good position in the first half of the match and then if not, you know, we'll see what happens in overtime kind of thing now to kind of circle back to the question that was poised at the beginning of the podcast which is our leg locks still essentially The Meta kind of front and center and I would say yes for the time being they are we saw a lot of heel hook finishes. Some people commented that there were not as many leg locks is there were was in a TCC 2017 and if you look at the breakdown of the heel hooks, actually a lot of them happened in the absolute Division and a lot of them happens because of Lockland and getting I think he got like four leglock finishes three or four in his absolute run and that without him maybe the statistics would have kind of evened out a little bit. However, I would say he's not an anomaly because he He's able to go in there and make really good use of that skill set. One thing that I saw in a TCC is that I I felt like there was a clear distinction between the new school leg locking crew. That was at a TCC and some of the old school and old schools Probably sounds more pejorative than I mean it to be but we see this all the time in our gyms at home, which is there are some students and there. In some cases entire gyms that they just don't do the leg lock thing and maybe they learned defenses to it, but it's just not part of their repertoire. Some of it is, you know, the tradition and the history of it that some people just don't really believe in it may be an old school mentality kind of thing. But I definitely saw that ACC there was even a moment and this was a moment that was almost a metaphor for the entire thing. I'm talking about which is buchecha versus Gordon Ryan and Gordon Ryan. Was you know working his game and buchecha of course is a legendary competitor and he's known for having a pretty fundamental old school game. I think it's safe to say and there was a moment where buchecha was not faring. Well, I think he was down on points and he actually sat down for a leg attack and Gordon openly laughed at him and then buchecha started laughing in the middle of the match and then the entire audience tonal was chuckling for a Moment and the joke was is that you know buchecha would just he's not the guy that drops back for leg locks and I don't know why he did that. Maybe it was a desperation because he was down on points or something like that.	1.0

Even if your room isn't completely tidied up or whatever. Just making the bed makes a big difference and a lot of times that's kind of the springboard to get your room clean. Once you see your med Bay, once you see your bed made it leads to other cleaning. Like putting clothes in the hamper putting shoes away clearing clutter from the nightstands. And then of course the bonus chores in a bedroom or just like the living areas. Maybe you need to clean a sliding glass door or wipe down a windowsill. Maybe you need to remove clutter. I often need to remove clutter from our bedroom dresser. We tend to accumulate stuff. So from time to time, I need to put those items away where they go. I think everybody has a surface in their house that attracts clutter. For me one of them is definitely the kitchen island is one and then the master dresser is one.	0.0

We do give that impression and I just want to say that yes, we enjoyed a drink but like we don't we don't do that every day, and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. No, it's we're working on it. We're working on our no so as we're drinking wine, so no, so basically a lot of them had to do. With stories of us and like the most Hammer we've been together and we were thinking and I said to myself. Well, I mean the most hammered I've ever been just hasn't been with her. Yeah. We kind of came to that conclusion that like we have been very much hammered together college high school, but God well no together. No, I know but you mean other than like being together. I like we're going to tell some stories and one of my stories of the most drunk. I've ever been has been in high school. I started early start him young start him young I really did. Like I had like a lot of things in high school, which mine was in college mines mines pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to start? I'll start. All right. Okay our love. Okay. So this was when I was 20 years old, so I wasn't 21 yet and I feel like when I turn 21 Unlike just a side note like I tamed down a little bit. That's not like as like yeah. Yeah, you're 21 like drinking song is fun anymore. Yeah, like don't get me wrong. There was no thrill. I mean there was a thrill they're still a threat or so, but this was back when it was like Wild and Woolly. Okay, so I was 20 and it was about three months before I was going to be 21 years old. So a bunch of my friends at that time. We're turning 21. It was junior year. Everybody was like had that calendar out, you know what I mean when like they were had like the 21 countdown. Oh, yeah, three months two months one month. So my friend had a birthday in January and she decided to hold it at this club called story bill and it's in Boston and it's it used to be super fun. I don't really know what it's like now, but I said to myself I'm going to go and it's going to be awesome and we're gonna we're gonna get in there and I had a fake ID at the time and it was a Real a real fake ID if that makes any sense. It was a real human being I had a girl from Suffolk who just like totally hooked me up like she had dark hair and blue eyes and just like she just let me have it. I gave her 50 bucks to get a new license and she just she was awesome. She was the MVP. So I had I had an ID and at the time I was eating a guy who was older so he was over 21 and I said, you know, we I really want to go to this. I want to celebrate her birthday. 'The day he said sure the day of the birth day comes I was I remember I like legitimately like of course went Forever 21 and like found a sexy jumpsuit with like a super crazy v-neck in it and I was like, I'm hungry.

I didn't do an inventory list, so it wasn't until last year. I think it was where I actually started getting serious about documenting everything that right.

And the particular person what works for how you know how I learn is different from maybe how you learn, you know, maybe a classroom setting works better for me. I'm not sure if that's true. But like maybe it does it just depends like and I think again, this is a conversation. I think we could probably do a whole episode on I think Film School versus not filming. We should I think we should too like I found it helpful for me for the most part, but what I didn't learn I learned a lot about story if anything the four years was worth the screenwriting class that I took an incredible teacher named Paul Larsen. And who the guy just the best thing about him? He taught me the one rule of screenwriting like screenwriting doesn't really have rules. There's one rule and of keep it interesting. Yeah, whatever it takes to make that happen. Well, we've that we've made not to jump ahead but we've made three short films together and I think that shows right? Yeah, I think so. I think that's it everything. I feel like I should have like tattooed on my butt or on your butt or is that you know what I mean, like like or on like a written on a wall would probably make a lot more sense or just an arm or just two dozen armed. Yeah or tattooed on my eyeball. It just like I think it's probably the best piece of writing advice I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of writing advice everybody has writing advice but if keep it interesting if you remember that and you look what you're doing, like is this interesting and even if it's just interesting to you, you know, that's that's a start as long as it's interesting in some way shape or form that was kind of the past.	1.0

Yeah, and I think that's something that I would encourage like more Christians to think. about is that like is it possible that these people that do have a good amount of self-worth and that are happy and fulfilled in their life and you know are truly living like enjoy like is it necessary for you to then go and like tear that down to try to like put your belief system on them like you could be causing more her and more harm and I honestly think that that kind of is what happened when I was 12 like I was such a happy The little girl and like that didn't obviously go away overnight, but it was like I didn't necessarily like need these messages that they were telling me and they didn't they didn't help like they didn't make me feel better necessarily but I mean a lot of this like analyzing has come since I've left like, I don't want people to think that like I was miserable for 10 years because I wasn't like I still liked my time as a Christian, but it's just looking back. It's like, I don't know if I would Choose that again.	1.0

Basically I felt very nervous out the gate. I was incredibly nervous and it was in my opinion. It was reflected in the pitch because I honestly my opening was Completely different than then I had prepared for and I just kind of got caught off guard by how nervous I was at the very beginning and then I kind of got my bearings back and then I felt good and after a few minutes, so after you get in the room you start pitching so you're obviously a little bit nervous up front.	0.0
Well, I wish when he loved down and out when he found it out ahead of time. I'm he should have tried to put a stop to it. I do want to say something about the trade machine though. I mean it's it is interesting. So Paul horns was was asking Chris Hansen Eddie about kind of the mechanics of Trades and how they decide what a player's value is and God bless onesie because that's not something you can answer simply in a 30-second reply or but you know the teams they basically assigned a dollar value to every player in every system and it's You know, you're not trying to match up. You're just trying to get an idea for what a player is worth might be over the Long Haul and the thing is is Linus has woken up from a slumber. The thing is like when you're trying to find a match for an Indian's Dodgers trade. It's not going to be even the team that's taking on the younger less proven players is the team that needs to have that higher number because there's more risk involved, you know, so you're not trying to trade Lindor if he's valued at 80 million and you're not trying to trade him for 80 million dollars of surplus of value of prospects. You got to get more back. And so that's that's I think that's one error.	1.0

Way, I fully believe that what you do in dating like when you go too far you steal from Marriage from that and so you're stepping over boundaries that when you get into marriage, you're like, they'll be less of an enjoyment. So you have a and that's why you shouldn't date for too long. Like if you're 14, first of all, you shouldn't be dating. I don't think anyone under 18 needs to be dating. The purpose of dating is marriage. It's not to have a friend like the that's the purpose. It's like what is this person right for me? I think honestly, there are some 18 year olds who are like ready to be married. Read and there's different people I wasn't I mean I was 30 when I got married, but if you don't have life figured out, if you don't know what you're called to do, if you don't have a job if you're living at home, if you're not you don't have a course that you're on if you're like still playing video games for a few hours a day. You're not ready to be married. And therefore you should not be dating but choosing the right thing understanding the purpose. It's not companionship. It's not so your Instagram feed can be awesome. People can think you're popular like the purpose of dating is in that's another thing too because because of how	0.0

That's the beauty of this year's draft. However, I do think the Packers are actually pretty much enamored with one specific. Pacific player much like gudykunst says he was last year with Jai you are Alexander. I think that guy could be Noah Fant this year and I think 12 might be just a bit Rich for Noah Fant. If we're being quite honest, I would like to see him taken in the late teens early 20s, if possible. I think that that kind of meets the place where we could see a run on tight ends based off some of the other teams needs and value fits and stuff like that. No offense would be a dynamic player and a dynamic I did. Into this Packers offense and not to take away from TJ Hawkinson, but I think no offense. It's just Far and Away a better athlete even though the relative at the relative Athletic score would indicate. Otherwise, I just think that fan is going to provide more dynamic system from the tight end position than Hawkinson will I think fans are very capable blocker not as not as bad as he's given credit for he definitely has some work to do in the area, but I think he could be a very serviceable blocker moving forward and I think that given that that quality and that characteristic I think that he's going to be heads above TJ Hawkinson career-wise.	1.0

I honestly think that this is a this type of situation that we're going through right now is ideal. Feel for a trade down Drew lock is sitting there with some team licking their chops trying to get ahead of the of the Washington Redskins. I honestly think that they could they could get a pretty good haul if they traded out of this position you trade down a few spots, maybe four or five and you're still getting Jonah Williams Noah fan TJ Hawkinson greedy Williams, even who I would be completely okay with Green Bay spending a first-round pick, even though they spent so much draft capital on the position. You know, I you can never have too many corners, especially In and defense, excuse me, like like Mike patents. However, it's obviously a luxury to spend on a corner. I think at this point, I'm not ready to spend a top-15 pick on Devon Bush. That's my honest feeling about that. I think I think Brian Burns would be the selection for me here if if we had to take a selection at 12.	1.0

Is that what you're telling us a couple of the challenges that you have is the fragmentation of the market and you look at owners that say take a multi-family developer. For example, these may be small family offices that are throwing up maybe a couple of products every few years and they're not what we would Define as cereal buyers a construction services. And so when they go to develop a apartment Complex, they say right? What's the lowest cost that I can get this at the make the pro forma work not what would be the lowest cost at scale? If I was to build a thousand of these things some of your more your larger owners more Progressive owners think of a hotel flag like a Marriot. They are fully bought into the concept of modularization because I know they're going to be building hotels from now until the foreseeable future and the more cost-effective way. They can do that. They're interested in that and a big way. So at bathroom pain that's built in Miami or bathroom fathers built in Seattle. They're all for standardization Montreux zation and making their buildings more efficient from a construction standpoint because the scale and the dollars that have Place think of the same thing for somebody like a Facebook or Google that's going to be investing in billions of dollars worth of data centers over the next decade. Those are the folks that are really lean in same. All right, if we're able to save one percent on Ten billion dollars worth of construction that's real dollars that that that's a conversation. We're worth having if it's a fifteen million dollar apartment complex that only means, you know 1% of that to one owner. It doesn't get a whole lot of attention and when you see the magnitude of dollars that are spent on a sort of capex and the industrial face those are big dollars and the opportunity time the down time relative to construction or maintenance in those plants has big dollar. As well, so it's really the magnitude of the opportunity that gets people's attention. Otherwise, it's just something neat to talk about, you know, can we build something offsider prefab and slide and employees great.

It's a tractor. No, but like the big the core of this game. This is what was so important and what I was scared of which I think is easy to fall into for a game like this is that it takes itself. So seriously, and it doesn't have the gameplay to support it. Do you know what I mean? Like here? I can't tell what's more interesting like the graphics and everything going on or the gameplay? Because if you just have Graphics it's like just eating whipped cream, you know versus like having the gameplay behind it. There's like A cake there that's enjoyable to yeah, you know what? I mean? It's like you need cake you need cake before you put on the process might like to I don't know too sweet. I couldn't think of another example. Okay. How about this? Let's rewind rewind rewind it's like having a chassis of a car but no engine, you know, like a lot of games fall into this, you know where it looks really nice and I just like Wolfenstein falls into this. I think a lot of other games I can't think of but like games like Wolfenstein basically they look so nice and they have like really cool vibe to it. But then underneath the gameplay gets repetitive and is boring but it seems like with respawn there. They always put mechanics and gameplay first and then everything is periphery which adds to it.	0.0
yeah and weeks we've said it when you record three podcasts and week, I guess you can send a repeat yourselves, but it's I think you trade them now or you don't trade him at all and What makes this tricky is that you probably have definitely have multiple contingency plans. But you have to act on it that this offseason is certainly moving more quickly than the last few have and like if your end if you end up keeping Lindor, well, okay, then you got to go find your second baseman. You got to see if you can add to the Outfield. You got to see if there's a starting pitcher you want to move to get some offense if help do you need to supplement the bullpen if you trade Lindor Maybe He says you get back influence how you do part 2 if you don't trade Lindor you obviously have a plan for part two, but like at what point do you just move on and do decide? Okay talks are done. We're keeping them and we're going to go set our sights on all these other things we have to do and maybe once you start doing all those things it complicates the Lindor talks if the Dodgers end up getting desperate in mid-January and her like we got to do this we've missed out on too many guys.	1.0

Yeah with my disgusting burp. I apologize for any one who had to hear that. So last two weeks ago. We did the worst parent teachers episode. And basically we got through bedtime and a couple other times it's dinner time and some other shit and there's a lot of stuff we didn't get to and we had so many comments and so many different little topics within it that we wanted to finish it off. So that's what we're doing today and the first One of the top of the paper maybe not the top of the list but the top of the paper that I put together is homework. So today my kid gets home and he has to do like reading responses once a month where he has to do basically like a really brief book report on whatever book He's reading. I had to sit down with him and like help them structure it because like each there's three paragraphs and each one has to have kind of a different thing. I'm sitting with them and I much prefer this to math homework with him because the mass shit. I can't even do half it like it's getting more snow. He's in fourth grade is getting more sophisticated in the Common Core just the principles of it are tough. And before you start bashing Common Core. Yeah. I find it difficult. I understand the rationale behind it essentially is to give you like mechanisms be able to do math in your head in a more logical way the kind of the way that we do it like if you're breaking up a tip. You divide it by 10 you do all that shit right away with not really how we were taught. We were taught memorization and all that shit. Whatever. I'm not going to get in a comic or different app.	0.0

It's your host Bridget and Caitlin here to talk about your favorite topic our favorite towel thick Disney Channel shows / movies. And today we're going to talk about classic Hannah Montana, of course, so we actually picked basically we were thinking the we're going to start this out as for TV shows will. Two episodes of a TV show and then if we do a movie we'll just just do the movie. So we picked two episodes. The first one is season 1 episode 2 Miley get your gum. And the second one is season 2 episode 20. I will always load you alright.	1.0

Yeah, they're they're taking their Fortnight, you know connoisseurs and trying to bring it over here. Like now that stuff doesn't fly all the time. It doesn't come go one to one all the time, you know, and I mean, I think the only thing is like, yeah, you can't really slide as as good but your actual like speed Really isn't affected all and so yeah, I think maybe it is just a mind thing. So we just opened up the floodgates now, it's just going to be like everybody's going there taking vacations. We're good. We ruined it speaking of ruining it number four is the pit. The I think my favorite thing about the pit is nine times out of time then again, if I drop at the pit, my next stop will always be the slums because because of that Redeploy their it is always really good. And I mean no matter where the ring is. The redeploy will get you close enough where you can kind of take your time. So you can you can go all over the pit. You can go all over the slums get to that Secrets place that we were talking about and still have enough time like okay, I better go ahead and hit that redeploy. And then you start going towards, you know, like the what's that bunker called like to the West I mean, it's just like this big kind of Hangs over the mountain kind of hangs over the Cascades and stuff. I don't know what it's I don't know if that's named technically. So it's kind of like what it's just a little bit south of artillery, right exactly that so you can kind of start heading that way you won't make it because there's a little Bridge area but even that bridge area has some decent loot. I mean, I don't think you'll have high tier loot but it is a there's a good little stop there along the way and then even if the circles bearing down on you the the Outer Circle will most likely be somewhere around like Cascades. You know that first or that round to Circle usually will be right around Cascades no matter where it ends up on the on the map so you can make it there. Absolutely. No problem.	1.0

It was a different time again. Like when we look at how it is. Now, everything is so fluid and you know, but before everything was so rigid like this. Is he even back then it was like whoa. If you do television, you'll never be a film star. If you know, if you do film you can't go to tell like people looked at television like it was beneath the people still looked at, you know, you can go on to be a Broadway Legend and like with the music The Duality thing was was kind of rare back then I mean even when you go back before my time is You know, very make Barbra Streisand, you know what I mean? And Frank Sinatra was never really considered an actor. They were just taking advantage of situations, but you didn't certainly from the black side of things. You can see that Duality like that. So, you know, I never really everything happens for a reason and I know I put my all into it so I don't have any regrets in that way. Like I never feel like oh if I would have took this seriously like not took it seriously. I got I got thousands of songs in the stash. So, you know just Just it just wasn't meant for me to do it at that time.	0.0

Yeah, so I think honestly here I'm looking. This is possibly where we might see a running back come off the board. I think we're going to see the Packers pursue a past catching running back a passing specialist running back. There's a couple of them in this year's draft one of the James Williams from Washington State. He might be around five pick. He doesn't meet any of the thresholds necessarily he kind of is just below all of them. I think Miles Sanders is like the only one that meets them. All right now. Tony Pollard from Memphis is a guy who's kind of rising updraft boards as well. So this is where it really starts to get interesting with the Packers decide to do where they did where they decide to add depth, but I think what I'm doing here personally is I'm looking at a guy like dalen mac. So a guy like dalen mac. He's he meets the thresholds for the most part. He's a little little less agile than you'd want him to but he's a true nose tackle. He would take some of the duties off of Kenny Clarke the Packers have already met. With him, once which kind of says a lot to me, they're not meeting with a lot of players at this point, which is very surprising to me as considering the amount of visits at the rest of the teams in the league of had but the Packers have not met with a lot of players. So I feel like they're kind of they've already got their guys that they're kind of like targeting in on day lamech is a guy they've already met with I believe that was back at the Senior Bowl and he's a guy who pretty much meets what they're looking for. He's going to be a specialist guy, but he's gonna he's gonna be a tremendous nose. The NFL he won't provide much more. Other than that, but you'll be a tremendous run Defender and he can provide some juice from the interior as a pass rusher as well. He's got some he's got some nice moves that he likes to whip out every now and then so I'm looking at a guy like Darren Mack here. That would be my value pick and my best fit.	1.0
Yeah, I don't I don't love it. I like it more as like I think like a second place to go to like if I drop near it. I might go there and like okay nobody's been here or somebody has but maybe they had to drop something. I don't know so I don't like it to be my very first drop but every once in a while some of the You know, they'll be the jumpmaster and they'll be like, alright, we're going to Bunker and I'm like, all right, I do have to admit. I had one of my coolest coolest kills there because you have to tell me. Yeah, I dropped into a bunker bunker. I dropped into it. I want to say it was on the west side. So the one with like the kind of the archway or whatever and then the the two or three boxes there so I dropped. On that side and I dropped in a there. There's a bluff Honda. He's right there and I'm like, oh no no, no, she's gonna get me. I mean, I'm dead. I like I like in my mind. I had already given up here, you know, I was like, you know what? I'm not going to go down without a fight. So I just started hitting him hitting him over and over again and they're just like kind of running around like like they're brand new player in the like what's going on what's going on? And so finally a finished him off with a flying kick or whatever then all of a sudden I hear the gunfire from my teammates. Are somewhere else on like okay, I gotta grab something grab something and grab something and then I think I came up behind a couple of people and got them ended up getting knocked a little bit later, but it was like that rush or whatever. That was just like yeah, I'm not going down without a fight and I definitely didn't think it was gonna work because they actually got a gun and so they shot but it was a most home Peak. So the shot three times miss me two of them. So it was kind of crazy so number. Nine is going to be relay and relay. I felt like was a pretty good choice because I really like the wetlands. So whether or not you jump or you drop at Wetlands, like maybe you weren't quite able to get it to relay, but the good thing is that there's that redeploy right there. So regardless of where the circle is with that redeploy dropping there's really cool because you can kind of just take your time.	1.0

You know, I do believe that there is Merit to some of these like Health Trends or these different things that are being promoted now sure but 100% you should always experiment and try something on for yourself and then decide for yourself if it works for you. Don't take anything. Even sometimes what your doctor is telling you like. Nobody knows more about your body and what something feels like in your own experience than you do. With intuitive eating it's like you have to develop that strong internal Compass so that you know when something sits right because you know, I use this example all the time but like something like broccoli for example is generally considered a healthy food, right? So it's like maybe you think I need to be eating more broccoli or like even if I don't like the taste of broccoli, it's healthy. I should be eating it. Some people may eat broccoli and get horrible gas or a terrible stomach ache and like not be able to function because Are so bloated for the rest of the day for that person maybe broccoli is actually not a healthy choice and maybe they can find another vegetable that works for them. So if their Doctor is recommending them to eat more broccoli, it's just not going to be the thing for them.	0.0

I wanted to stay out of this because how TI raises his family ate my concern and it ain't my business. However, I am absolutely a here for a larger conversation about how girls and women's bodies are constantly being policed. Now, I will always be bothered by the fact that we are so consumed and fixated on the sexual behavior and the bodies of girls and women and I mean by both men and women case in point how many times have you heard men and some women but mostly men say they don't want a girl because then they have to worry about her getting pregnant or they don't want a girl because they don't want to think about all the boys and men trying to have sex with her and someday it will It their attitude is based off their own personal experience. They knew there was a time when they weren't shit, so they didn't want their own daughter exposed to some Reincarnation of their ancient Indus. So before a girl is even born before she even gets here people already policing her body. Now we have to deal with that our entire lives as women. Not just for my fathers brothers or Uncle's women can be just as guilty I often say this when discussing racism and racial oppression. Ian the real unfairness of dealing with those issues is that the burden and responsibility to solve the problem is placed squarely on the people most victimized by it. So when we have these conversations about rape and sexual assault the conversation is solely centered around women and what we need to do to protect ourselves. There's certainly a place for that but who is having conversations with young boys and men about consent about respect about keeping their hands to themselves if you don't want some asshole boy dish. Affecting your daughter then use that same energy with boys that you have when you want to police girls and women about their bodies instead of telling boys and men and run through as many girls and women as possible. If you want girls and women to be treated better. If you want us to be respected. It's simple raise better men stay on bothered.

Hmm should be interesting is to say the least I would have never thought, you know playing Teddy Pendergrass would be like Tyrese. Yeah, right. It's kind of weird. He's gotta do like, you know, they got to put them in full transformation. I suppose. We'll see how it worked. Oh, absolutely. I think that's an interesting story and then like you touching on like people are really interested in any biopics. I think you know for every for every like good when we do have some bad ones, but I mean, I think when I think of like the good ones, I think like the Bobbi Brown one that was pretty good. The new edition was probably the best one. It was a few more and they are you you have then you have the ones like Alia and the other stuff like that. So it's like it was a couple of the bad ones. I don't want to harp on them. But it's I like I like watching those because you get to see you even when you think you know everything about the artist or something like that that that's public knowledge those little those little tidbits to come in and he's like damn I ain't realized that like, will you watch the Bobby Brown stuff? You didn't know he was hitting Janet Jackson like no. I mean how many people really knew that? I didn't so it was like, okay.	1.0

So it's true only late. Once and used to be like our for our school, they would you would check down there like a Scantron sheet where the teacher would kind of everybody was absent and then take it down take it and put it outside the door and me and to my friends got there late and then we just got that sheet and we erased we are absent and then we went off and we just hung out for like the rest of that our first of all you just took the hour off easy enough. Yes. We got away with it was great. So, yes you did you did mention. Mr. Honey, our new principal play biker Smith.

Oh, yeah. Nice. That's cheesy like FM phones up like worried to be like always worried about what what's going to happen with this Maps because I don't think valve communicate that well. With the mappers and people who get their Maps included in the game or anyone for that matter. So I think it's a probably a sigh of relief for him who I'm sure it does a lot of this stuff by himself without even talking about like for example with a simple graffiti that's on cash under Heaven on be site. He did that himself. It's not it's not actually a major a major moment graffiti by Valve. It's a graffiti. He added by himself picking up from from the major.	1.0
You get all this data from all these retailers and that makes you sort of Target better. And yeah, so that's don't talk to that.

So more people tend to use it and the more people who use it the better the search results it gives because Google is learning from every single user and this is one of the reasons why it is so hard to knock off big tech companies.

The reality situation is at almost every company that you hear from on the pitch is going is needs to be moving toward machine learning and artificial intelligence. And I think that as we grow and we them More customers we have the more valuable the business gets and so as we grow that Network effect provides us with industry data based on verticals like a pit like apparel Electronics, etc. For each of Our Brands that industry is gay this seems different to me than the network effect.	1.0

Yeah, and I was just going to input that there were a lot of leadership changes during that time. But again, we don't know who influenced what and ultimately because Jeff was gone for a minute and I'm pretty sure Jeff was fired for a minute and but it was right at the same time as a like. The crossover where the change in leadership because LJ is Lindsay Jewett Sturman. She was in charge of season 5 for the most part. She took Jeff's notes and then really kind of cobbled that together and then they announced that season six was Jeff's last they got Hall age, which I'm like y'all paid out the but for this and then you know Season 6, so I'm like this wasn't a someone was doing him a favor.

Thanks for having me.	1.0
Yeah, so, I mean that's how a name gets tossed out there. I don't know the veracity of the report that was was out there. I mean if you look at the facts. If you traded Lindor and Clevenger separately you get so much more than if you treated them together, you could find a team desperate for starting pitching trade them Clevenger and get a top prospect. And then some you trade Lindor and Clevenger together and it's like yeah, you're gonna get a huge haul but you could get a huge haul for both of them separately. I think the the more realistic thing first of all as I've said they're going to go to Clevenger and Bieber at some point in the next month or two and say let's talk Extension. I think there's a better chance Beaver signs agrees to something then Clevenger does but as we said like Clevenger was a late bloomer. He's about to be 29 years old. It's going to hit free agency at about 30 right before his 32nd birthday. I don't know if it seems going to give you that. They're not going to give you the Gerrit Cole Stephen Strasburg type deal at that age. So it's and you gotta prove yourself in the next three years. So it's a little riskier. So maybe he signs. Maybe he doesn't if he doesn't And I think he does become a logical trade candidate a year from now not the type of thing where like Trevor Bauer where they really wanted to get rid of them. But you explore just like they have with tons of other guys, but I don't think it makes much sense to trade him. Now. I don't think it makes any sense to include him in a Lindor deal to sweeten the pot. I think you could dangle kluber in that package certainly maybe a younger picture. But yeah, I think you keep them separate and then During Bieber or the reason why you feel like whether you trade Linda or not, you're still going to contend and be a threat to win the division and make some noise in the playoffs.	1.0
Yeah, I'm saying this in between like somewhere like overboard and not over. Oh, whoa. No, that's obviously not over. I wish it was. It's easy. I'm I'm happy. I went I fucking hated the walk home. I have I'm happy I want.	1.0

I agree with you that I think it should be like, I think they should revisit it for a limited time think Jessica. Test and see I think it'd be so cool to have like let's say the last three squads or something and then like a Titan drops and of course, you know, like the squads are going to run for the Titan. Yeah, because I think a lot of people who are against it and saying that a Titan might be too overpowered also doesn't realize that in Titanfall them if you're a pilot and you're not in the tighten your number one like your number one goal is the mantle that tighten and pull that battery out. The Titan is like dead within a couple seconds, right? Yes, like it would it would be testing it would change the gameplay. I love it. I would like it but I could see how people who might not be much of a Titanfall fan prior to Apex would be overwhelmed with a total of those people exist who played Apex without knowing about and it's playing Titanfall. I mean the player base is so much. Oh, that's a good point. I think they're really the last time they announced a milestone was like 50 mil. Yeah, right they like that. So I Like that definitely it wasn't what Titanfall 2 clocked but but who knows? Yeah, I mean, I feel like it would just it would just be nice just to have it and the game up a little bit so that it doesn't get into that kind of repetitious Lumpur has something people can look forward to that like old fans would be really excited for I think for sure.	1.0
when everything disappeared what now? Let me tell you.	1.0
So I just made the pick Debo Samuel. Welcome to Green Bay. If this would work out for me getting a Friday which we will be recapping day 2 of the draft on the packet a podcasts ourselves in just about a month or so for now is picks flying off the board. Now as we are into round three just waiting on a few of the simulation to go. Well. Luckily. I have it on the fast timing so that will move fairly fairly well, And now grimby up at pick 75 names that came off since then notable names Daniel Jones went to Washington to do quarterback Hollywood Brown goes to the Panthers Chase winter, which breaks Jacobs hard everywhere. He goes to the Dolphins Dexter Lawrence to the Browns Charles omena Hue from Texas to the Vikings Kelvin Harmon to the Steelers Michael Dieter first Badger off. The board goes to Philly Caleb McGarry and Taylor at back to back to Houston Trayvon Mullen to the Patriots running back off the Cordero Henderson from Memphis to Philly Dan to the Dallas Cowboys rakia sin quarterback from Temple goes to the Indianapolis Colts David Edwards for another Badger goes to the Chargers Julian love gone to the chief Sandy Isabella to the Saints Jason Stern Burger Patriots get another cell a tight end which really hurts the inside Eric McCoy round 3 to the Cardinals Paris Campbell just went off the board Tyree Jackson Off the board to Jacksonville Blake Cashman off the board in a Rasta, whatever. And him to Tampa Bay last pick made was the Andre Walker Edge from Georgia to the Buffalo Bills. So one Thornhill still out there at 75. So the rock in the podium, I read it.	1.0

It's like it goes thoughts feelings behaviors. Yeah. So like if you get a nasty thought try to cut it like nip it in. The bud isn't becomes a feeling in your feelings feel real now that it can become a behavior. Yep, you know, definitely it's a cycle so and yeah, then sometimes the behaviors could take over because So tired you can just sleep and it just feel everything perpetuates.

Thanks Jay. Couple of years off my life, but the craziest part to me was that there were some fans some Indians fans who were saying still probably not enough. I'm like, what are you expecting? I do think we need a little bit of a reality check when it comes to what fair trade offers would be. I think like I mean, I think the Dodgers are struggling to come to terms with the idea of even including Gavin Luxe by himself. Like that's it. Yet you're having people saying like Lux plus May plus Verdugo. I would definitely need all three of them and then it probably want like another piece or and it's like that's not how this works and teams treasure young controllable cheap Talent more than ever. And guess what the Dodgers have a really really smart front office. So yes, Dave you think you're sick of the Indians winning 90 plus games every year and not doing anything about it. Dodgers fans are so sick of the Dodgers winning. Seven straight NOS titles and having nothing to show for it with a massive payroll and robust farm system, but still their teams are disciplined and the Dodgers have a really good front office and they're not just going to throw everything at the wall to get Lindor for two years and maybe they could reassign them. But, you know teams just don't do that. I think it used to be a lot easier to pull off this sort of trade because there are there were more dumb front offices. I don't think I think there's only a couple of now and those teams probably are pretty bad. So you're not going to be dealing with them in this situation.	0.0

It's a great read go check it out. And then she said TV, but essentially the relative athletic scores just me. They are comparing athletes for the last 30 or so years. There's a specific year that this dates back to kentley Plaid on Twitter at math bomb to the fantastic fantastic job of putting all this data together and he does it I believe for free. I don't think he gets any money for it, but it's basically a formula that he's arrived and a model and he just puts these numbers out. And what it does is it Compares Compares players relative to other players of their position using their size the height their weight, they're all their testing scores and just kind of puts out what percentile athlete they are in comparison to the rest of the players that were at that position for the last x amount of years. So every single year, it gets more it gets stronger and better indicator of what type of athlete that you're dealing with. With and it's just it's such a great tool and and we're blessed to live in the 21st century.	1.0

Hi everyone, welcome back to the high percentage podcast. I had a terrifying 20 minutes there because I was having microphone problems and I was like, wow if we don't got a microphone, we don't got a podcast today, but got that worked out. Hey back after a Hiatus last week. We did not upload an episode and an old teacher of mine used to say there's a difference between excuses and reasons and I have reasons for this. Which was I did a DCC play-by-play last weekend. It was great and it was brutal at the same time. It was two days of nothing but watching matches and typing, you know, quick play-by-play summaries on to the computer and then quickly kind of uploading them and getting them refreshed on grappling insider.com on the plus side. We had the most traffic we've ever had in a single weekend. I mean, we really crush it and I think we did the only play-by-play really that I could find on the internet. Yet and I don't know why because it's something that definitely people look for and find Value in so that was fantastic. The downside is as far as I could tell we watched over a hundred Jiu-Jitsu matches and you know, I love Jiu-Jitsu as much as the next guy or girl but that was brutal man way. It was nine hours on Sunday and we didn't finish until the Super fight ended like it probably seven o'clock and I just didn't have it in me. I couldn't talk about Submission grappling anymore. So I took a break but I did post an article about a DCC over the week and that's why I like to talk about today because a TCC is a fantastic time to kind of check in on the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission grappling because it's generally agree that it's one of the top.	1.0

Every meeting them they eat whatever you like. If you go somewhere you end up getting them food. It's just a bunch of fucking old shit or like Ziploc bags full of Just go through them in ground in the dust. It just benches manhandling so many times or apples that just shouldn't all my God.

For me, the the unit of account of function is the derived one. So you have these three function that you find the text books rather three main functions are sort of value unit of account and medium of exchange. Okay, and the essential function of one is to serve as a medium of exchange so much that that's my point of view. Right? So we have this is the essence of money to are generally used medium of exchange but with that but without coercion Well, I mean the whole stew even for those monies that are being imposed right in one way or another right? So it's the generally used medium of exchange and then as a consequence you calculate in terms of that money unless they're very strong inflation or something like this, right then you need to calculate other different places, but the foundations, of course indeed to serve as a store of value and here indeed we have problems with Bitcoin because Bitcoin only serves as we evolve. Exchange or is a store of value for services right now. It's a speculative object and so on but it has no other function whereas precious metals have multiple. Alternative uses not only in jewelry. But yeah, very numerous industrial uses because of the particular very special physical characteristics of these Metals. So that means that in the case of all it's only always have a fallback position and there's always an additional demand industrial demand or non-monetary demand that serves as a buffer to salvage the these Metals if ever the monitor uses put into question. So on bitcoin is much more fragile about that because it has no natural non-monetary use. So I think Bitcoins have come into circulation and can be kept there thanks to the ideological now and not in the negative sense right would just say libertarian talking exactly. Do you need to have people as the commitment who are ready to absorb the losses that come with a fall in the value of Bitcoins some if everybody just cells Because the price is going down. Well Bitcoins will be driven completely out of the market. So for this not to help you need to have people who are committed to bitcoin. So you don't consider it merely as a monitor your financial instrument now in the case of gold and silver you don't need this you because gold and silver have always other users and people who are active in jewelry or who use: silver cellphones or Aerospace. And however, they will be happy if prices go down and so you don't need that sort of emotional intellectual commitment to this. So therefore they are more robust Bitcoins.	1.0
Yes, and that's actually how they found us. And we basically we were in like the jeans and t-shirt kind of thing and they saw it on YouTube they loved it and they're like, we need something like this on our type of show. So we're like, you know, what why not we can compete and we can do something like this that's super creative on the side and it's the best platform where we can just show what we're all about because there you're not in a ballroom dance competition there you're in just you're in a mix of just gorgeous dancers. And again, you're just super grateful of a be there and you look around just like the best hip-hop and contemporary dancers and Jazz dancers old from all over the world and credible. It's so it was so so cool. So that decision was super easy. We're like, all right. Let's try, you know, try something new. We've never done that before and we are so grateful we did and we did. Make it that far but like we definitely got great exposure from there's people started contacting us and recognizing us for what we do and that was the biggest thing and it was just again, we're just super grateful to be there.	1.0

Yeah. So if you're looking at the the IR 500 which is a sampling of a top 500 retailers in the market 60% of those retailers don't have don't have a mobile app don't have no looks 60 that's shocking don't have any mobile app, and why because it's a very risky proposition if you are a retailer and you You want to build a mobile app and the case of a smaller retailer whose generating a million dollars or more in Revenue? Yes, that retailer spending a quarter of a million dollars the first year to build that mobile application. Yes. Okay. So a brand like Cabela's or Macy's is spending at least a million dollars per app store today. Okay, using our platform. They're spending a fraction of that and so we're giving you with a single SAS fee a turnkey solution that you don't have to worry about.	1.0

Aren't you master next RZ masks RZ masks? We bought four of them for the Department. We bought the EM ones with the F3 filters which are the carbon filters. They're really really great for mapa. Again. We were talking about him earlier tonight for medical calls. They're great for if you're on the if you're the pump operator is well and you're just getting kind of a little bit of excess smoke coming out. Its they're good for there. To ease them for them and they're great in the because they're neoprene is well, they're really good in the winter to keep your face warm and you're doing when you wandering around right? Like if you are at the idea, uh, they're very very useful still just the kind of take the edge off as well and and keep you moving forward. So if you would like to pick one up code you can use for 30% off is DTF. F for 30% off of your next RZ mask order. Again, we are not sponsored by them. We just bought them because they were good quality masks. We were looking for something a little bit less arduous like the like Runnin SCBA. You didn't need for the full thing that you still want to submit a bit of protection just to keep you safe. That definitely feels that spot. Yeah, grab my we all gone.	1.0
I agree. I agree. I mean looking back at you know, my life just long so far, but when I look back in my life, you know, I know there's times when I wasn't the best person I could be you know, and any and those those moments, you know, if you know, you can't redo them, you know, there's times when I have been unkind I have either verbally been unkind or I've mentally been unkind and both of those things are you know things as humans, we you know, we got to deal with we got to recognize it but hopefully learn from it as well. And so, you know as we notice unkind things because it's going to happen in the classroom. We're Notice on kind things. Hopefully, that's the takeaway that students can can learn as yes, you know, this happened and and showing them how that's not the person they're going to want to grow up to be right. That's not the person and and when they can look at you you teachers out there and see that person who they're going to want to walk in your footsteps and hopefully that's the takeaway from today's episode.	1.0

It's something I never get sick of telling because because I love this lady with all my heart. So when I started teaching I moved two and a half hours away from home. I knew like obviously my wife's family. That's but that's all I knew up here. I didn't know any teachers. I know nothing about the school Trish and I I moved to a town near her hometown. So we were near her family and I started this job at an amazing team that took me in there under their wings and we just we got along super great and we just had a blast together. And at the time we were a team of three teachers and I kept hearing these stories about this teacher who was now in the junior high level. Her name was honor Trotter and she had taught kindergarten. Actually. My room was her kindergarten room before I came and I got to know honor a little bit over the first couple years of teaching because she was doing A junior high like I don't science work, but she's also doing reading Specialists work on our end. So my kids got to go see her every now and then and I just I would spend my break. I know that seems like a weird word and education so we don't really get those but my break with my students would actually get time as a class to go see honor in Reading tight like that await a specific dedicated reading block that she got to take kids and do awesome activities. I found myself not taking a break but sitting and watching her and I was amazed at the way this woman taught and II guess our school didn't really have an official Mentor program at the time but I considered her my mentor because I learned more from her than I ever did from any textbook or any course I ever took and it it wasn't just about teaching it was just about the way she interacted with with not just students but human beings and I use that term a lot when I go out and speak that we need to treat these people in our classrooms and our lives not as students that are walking through a door. But his people is anybody else wants to be treated, you know, so I learned a lot from her on that subject and then When she was close to retirement, she actually came back to kindergarten she joined our kindergarten because our numbers were growing and she went to our board and our Administration said listen. I know you're going to be hiring kindergarten. Please. Let me finish up my career there where I started and of course they were like, yeah, let's do it. So I want to say I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but maybe the last five six seven years of her career were spent in kindergarten and I got to be a part of her team. It was it was awesome. We were team before for a while then a team of five them sema4 went back and forth, but it was always Myself, my neighbor Tiffany and Lori who were my three what I started and then honor it was always the four of us plus another 1 or minus another one and honored just to just was just an awesome person in the working with and getting to learn from her and then two years before she was about to retire. She was kind of forced into early retirement because she was diagnosed with cancer that forced her to stop teacher Chic. She had to take care of herself as she was weakening. She only made it about nine months. After she was diagnosed and I'll never forget when she called me up one day. I still remember I was laying on my couch watching a movie phone rings. It was like a Saturday and it was her and she was he come over for a minute and she lived like a half hour from where I live. So it's like yeah. Yeah, like what what's up, you know and my daughter was I think to at the time so she was probably napping and I just looked at Trisha. I'm like I need to go to honors house and she's like for what it's like I really don't know and I knew that she had been out and having some medical issues. I didn't know that it was going to be big and she sits me down a couch and tells me that she has cancer and of course as anybody would I lost it I started crying and I didn't know what to think and she didn't shed a tear. She's smiling at me and I looked at him like what are you doing? Like, how are you know said she goes she goes I've cried out of my I cried when I got the diagnosis, but she goes I've learned to accept the fact that there's a reason that I have cancer and and how it blew my mind. I mean, I probably jaw dropped look they're like, what do you mean there's a reason like no, there's no For a reason for this and she truly was the most hopeful person in the world. She believed that there was a purpose to her being diagnosed with cancer and I know the stories going on. I apologize for rambling but there's a point to this there really is. So I guess the point this is that that there was never specific lesson from her that she came out and said this is the way you should be treating people or here's a lesson on kindness or here's a lesson on bullying or is she there was never a specific thing that I recall a my mind at all it started with that moment when she Said to me there's a purpose for this and at that time I had no idea that it was becoming it was I had no idea. I mean no one thought she's gonna pass away as fast. She did we just we didn't really know and then when we lost honor we never got to find out what she thought her purpose was, right? So honored passed away nine months after diagnosis, May 6th of 2013 and the week after her funeral or that actually three days after she passed away was her birthday birthday is May 9th and on that day our entire Will went out back and we bought I don't remember how much I think we bought 60 because it was gonna be on her 60th birthday on May 9th. We bought 60 yellow balloons and released them one of our past PE teachers who had taught With Honor for 30 plus years brought little yellow bracelets to the school for everyone like rubber bracelets, you know that said honoring Honor on them. She given to every student staff member like thousands of these bracelets were headed out and I just remember being out on this lawn with our entire School telling stories of her microphone. Everybody got to kind of share their story about honor that was close to her. We sang Happy Birthday. We let these balloons go and and something about that day and the I don't have image the balloons were yellow honors favorite color was yellow. So that's the reason for the yellow balloons the yellow bracelet. She just loved the color yellow and that day became an image. I guess that was etched into our school forever now because it's continued but so fast forward again, and that year went on we all made it. Through the school year a new year started and then things started to seem kind of weird as they would if you lost, you know a family member best friend are our building just didn't seem the same we knew she was still there, but we can still hear her laugh in the hallway. We knew she was there but something struck me as something I guess important in the fact that I needed to find a way or we as a team or a teacher group or a school need to find a way to keep her alive in our building as much as possible and to do that on my end. I mean, we've all done our own share of things of sharing her story of an item. High-end, I wrote a book about her and it was a book called yellow that Shameless plug here. You can find on Amazon or you know, you don't have to buy my book. You can go to my YouTube channel teachers learn to dot common and see a free video of me reading it to your class. So check that out. But anyway, I wrote this book as a way to keep her alive because I felt there were so many students and staff cheated out of getting to know her and I felt lucky that I got to write. So I wrote this book. I got to start traveling around to schools as an author of all things which Blew my mind because I just wrote this just for her, you know sharing honor story. And the reason that was brought up was because her story was all about just making people happy and there's a line on the book that says Honor made people's gray skies into yellow Skies or turn people's gray skies and yellow skies because that's what she did and it wasn't. I mean, I know there's so many kindness campaigns out there then they're all great, but hers wasn't about doing anything for anyone. It wasn't about doing a random act of kindness. It was more so that she got people to realize the good in. Side themselves just like being the person she was and I know that sounds kind of confusing but I don't know how she did it. But she made you feel like the best person in her life. No matter what it was and she just found a way to make everybody smile and make you very happy. Yeah, and that's the kind of kindness that she spread was just getting other people to feel good. It wasn't going out of her way to do anything. She was just that type of human being she made everybody feel special special. Yeah an important and noticed, you know, And she made you feel good about yourself. She brought out something in me that I don't know. I'd ever experienced before you know, so I keep saying this but fast forward again and I think three or four years after she had passed away we decided to keep her birthday celebration going but even more and Anna term had come up from my book called make someone's day yellow and we just kept using that over and over again in our building would skip say to make someone's day LSA make someone's day yellow today rather than saying like pay it forward. We just said make someone's day yellow And we decided to do that. So we on May 9th three years ago, four years ago. Whatever. The first one was. We decided to celebrate honors birthday at our school with what we call Yellow day and we did just kind things all day long. We decorate our entire school to look yellow. I mean balloons streamers posters. Everything was turned yellow we did do random acts of kindness for people around the building. So we delivered like flowers to the secretaries and just rope notes to teachers and random people saying smile today are hope you have the best day ever. Or thank you for being you just things that honor would have done without really knowing them we decided to do purposefully, right and after it happened after yellow to happen. I videoed the whole thing. I put on my YouTube channel and about two weeks after the day. I got a message from a teacher and I look at the location. It was from Australia, and it blew my mind that someone lost really was even watching my little YouTube channel, right? I looked at the comment and said thank you for sharing this message. We're going to try to do a yellow day at our school and I I remember running to school the next day like oh my gosh you guys check this out someone in Australia is going to do our celebration like it's going to spread and then these emails and messages started coming in at one after another after another after another and and over the past three years of doing yellow day at our building and then spreading around other schools and other states and other countries we've hit I think eight different countries where we've seen yellow Day celebrated and 35 different states within the u.s. I can't count the number of schools that it's reached. The number of people it's reached but yellow day has become a movement is what we've used the term as As you know and going back to an honor was diagnosed and what this all meant. I truly believe that everything that happens in your life is done for a purpose whether you want to believe in a higher being or not or what your beliefs are. It doesn't matter to me. Everything happens for a reason. Let's not deny that fact there's a reason behind everything that happens and I never forget two years ago on the other day when it was really getting big and blowing up. We were getting messages from schools left and right and people post on social media like picture after picture after picture after picture. A bunch of us teachers were standing outside my classroom door talking and showing sharing images of images that we were tagged in after school. And one of our first grade teachers Donna walks by and she goes this is it Adam and I said, excuse me, and she is this is the purpose and I said, what do you mean and she goes this is why honor had cancer and I lost it like a probabilistic. I lost it. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's true. Like we never got to find out what honor believed her purpose for having cancer was until that day and we truly feel like her reason for being diagnosed.	1.0
Okay? Okay. I'm going to piggyback off you. I'm not going to name the same people twice, but as everybody knows who listen to this podcast and just you know mess with Over the years for rails my absolute favorite producer of all time, but I want to add some more people jazze PHA. I think I didn't jazze PHA definitely made definitely made a lot of Jazzy Fizzles production zaytoven, even though even though I kind of criticized him a lot of times because for the longest he did not make like different sound he beats he loved using those freaking Jamaican drums and it he will not do anything else, but they Toven, he literally like me Gucci Mane's career. I'm not even gonna lie, like he may go to man's career because those be they made for him like and all those freaking mixtapes albums that he put out. They told him made that sound fam. So like they told me I had to get his respect for the new wage trap sound in ATL like without a doubt that man is freaking amazing. Who else who was want to mention Bangladesh back when he was popping Bangladesh Bangladesh definitely has some dope-ass his just blaze just Blues.	1.0

Yeah, exactly. I know other don't worry part of you is like, I've got a marathon to go that sucks. But then I was like no don't let that throw. It's a marathon yet only a marathon and but yeah and at that point, you know, you're starting to cross paths with more people. It was and then so I grabbed another at drop bag with some more food in it. And the next there's about 18 kilometres to checkpoint for and it checkpoint for I had my buddy run. I was coming on to join me for the last sort of 27 on ches. That was Aaron Cole batch and Aaron, it was great. So I sort of push through checkpoint to checkpoint for and you go through this section. It's my favorite part of the whole race even though about kilometer. He or the high 60s you're going up through what's it called Mount magnificent and into the fitness Conservation Park and it's just the so pretty through there like its Farmland at this is beautiful farm houses nestled in amongst these like really spectacular Rolling Green Hills. It is and the kind of Rocky, but they're also really green. It's just lovely and I really focused on Deserving that but also I focused on again anytime I could run I would run out hit the hills if it was a hill I would be if I was walking I was power hiking like I was really just wanted to keep my time to get my legs moving. And so I was at managing to power like it under 10 minutes per kilometer, which I was happy with so not nice work. Yeah pretty quick. There were people quicker than me at that. But you know, and at this point, I'd Fallen back a few places, but I sort of was focusing more on. And what I was doing and not worrying too much about the race itself and just worried about my own race. And then so again to check point for which was glorious and I for the first time I thought I'm gonna have a little sit-down at checkpoint for for a few minutes and that's that was my little reward for being very efficient through the previous age stations. It's at this point you at 77 km/h know you've really sort of broken its back and I Saw My Buddy Aaron and it was just you know reinvigorated me and it was funny though. My brain was getting a bit muddled as it is kind of now and I went to take something out of my back. My back was the first time I'd taken my pack off as well. I took my pack off briefly or took something out and I just somehow everything fell out of my pack and like I just had my shit everywhere and it's like I don't know how to put this back in and it's like I've been people laughing at me and And she's a really good atmosphere there and everyone just friendly and I got it all back in probably spent longer there at the age station that I really wanted to but you know it is what it is and it just some you know, it was not that was not part of the plan. But then with Aaron she just can't be honest and kept me running when I could run and made sure I kept sipping fluids and eating a beer and like it was a turn into a beautiful afternoon. Coming into the last sort of you come into kaipo forest from the last sort of twenty five k's and it's a pine Plantation. And so all right. Yeah. So pine trees everywhere. We've got a nice sort of feel and one going between farmland and pine plantations and like really I didn't have any like spectacularly low moments. I just I feel like I mean I was at low power low ish points, but I just was able to manage those low points better than I have in the past. So I'm really happy about that. And so my goal was always initially my main goal. I wanted to get under 12 hours, but I knew that was off the off the Record like 12 hours is pretty lofty goal one day one day one day but my next goal was to beat the Sun and so I thought I can still do that. So I had to do about under 13 hours to do that and I came into there's only nine kilometers between checkpoint four and five and I remember coming and so it's really nice short break. I grabbed a sat down had a ginger beer at checkpoint 5 didn't try to see there too long stuffed in some noodles. What took them on the go and I ate some of them and then had to ditch the rest because it was just getting a bit too hard to eat and I remember I had a what happened next? Yeah, then the last sort of 10 kilometers. Yeah, sad to feel a bit nauseous and then you know, but kept positive Aaron made me laugh and I was trying to high five as many volunteers and Spectators that I saw a long anyway, and then coming into the forest. I know the course really well the final and I actually from previous year. I had a landmark point where I knew. There was one kilometer to go but somehow this year I went past that last kilometer to go Mark and didn't notice and then I came around the other shit. The Finish Line was right in front of me was like just straight up by 200 meters and so some like always and I always was like somewhere I was able to leg it for the last couple of hundred meters and I managed to finish without using my head torch and not needing it probably if I was out for another 10 or 15 minutes. I would have had My head towards yeah, but I didn't need my head towards cross the line in 12 hours and 48 minutes and I'll start. Yeah, well, that's brilliant. Yeah, it's good.	1.0

That's a good question for me. I don't know if there's one thing I could point to to say.

I mean, I guess I'm proud that I've pretty much I was able to preserve my Integrity, you know, and you know my for the most part keep my moral compass as a man, you know, and that means something to me, but for me like my career is like pieces of Mosaic like half of it is done. That's the half we talking about another half. It's like it's not there yet because I love it. I love the whole thing.

At dinner, I just spoke about and who he was. No, I mean vaguely, you know, like the Digital Underground thing, but it was it was more vague. You know, we've I blew it was cool. Yeah that you know, he had that pack had that thing that some people have like when they walk into a room there's a magnetic energy that he just, you know, sort of sucks the air out of the room and then after you know, We all found out we got it and I think he was staying at Harlem at the time but his mom's and then they started bringing us in like the rehearsal process and that sort of thing. That's when we started getting cool and but Park was Park which is a one of one-of-a-kind do really really smart way more book reading people give him credit for and then you know, once we started the filming process man, we just Got tight and got cool and it was it was all New York. So, you know cats was trailers was getting ran up in and robbed and it was all type of stuff happening around the filming process because it was still old New York and no I remember going uptown with him to you know, go to his mom's crib and met her and he was a good dude, and he was told he was recording his first album at the time so I have fond memories of like in between Takes all the you know lunch break. He'd be like yo o run up being I'm run up in the trailer and he would be spitting around to me and I'm like, oh, what's that fool? And he was like, oh, I'm gonna do this song blase blase bar, and I've told her story once before but I remember with this is when I really sort of Genius apart one day we came to set and he was reading the papers and some woman had through her baby in the incinerator, right? That's a horrible thing, but sadly grown up in New York at that time. That was normal to hear like you heard stuff like that all the time and park was so affected by like it was messing with him the whole day and I'm like, oh it was like whatever and same thing happened at lunch. Call me in the trail. Yo, he starts spitting this verse and I'm not putting two and two together now months later when the first album come out and I saw Brenda's Got a Baby. I was like, oh shit, that's the joint that and it but I saw the whole process and I was like, oh, yeah, he did.	1.0

And of course anchor which houses everything that you hear here and we appreciate all of the support and we hope that you all continue supporting us in the Future Let's go ahead and get into the notable new releases. Now we were talking about last episode that we were kind of disappointed because it hasn't really been any music coming out but last week we did get a healthy dose of music. So let's go ahead and go over the new releases 2 Chainz brought out his new project called rapper go to the league, which you had LeBron being a are for which I found that very strange, you know, it's a lot of controversy behind that because they were saying that he did not go to some games or he I'll just just to work on the album, but that's neither here nor there. It was very interesting to change took him onto to be in a are so and he said like this wasn't only project he had them like work on another project to so we'll see what comes through with that but it was a decent album. I listened to it on Friday when it dropped T-Pain Shawty pain because I don't know you probably don't watch it. But I know my girl religiously watch The Masked Singer where they had a whole bunch of whole bunch of Artists and athletes and everything you can name of entertainers dress up in Crazy suits and singing and then, you know, they get voted off of what night and T-Pain want it all and she got me into watching it and I was like, yeah, I was like I can tell his accent. I know that that's t-paint right there and the judge just weren't getting it but he ended up winning everything and if the funny thing ironically though, I would say coincidentally, I won't say ironically coincidentally his New project called wind up drop like the same week that he would so now everybody everybody is thinking that it was just a roll out. This is just to get people to listen to his music. But what did he case his new project called one up that came out like in the middle of the week didn't come out Friday, but go and listen to that Solange. She has been bringing like a lot of visuals and everything and people were like what's going on like she was even like posting a Pedro BlackPlanet people like this Black Planet back. So like right? Yeah, so it was kind of weird it everybody would kind of like speculating what was going on but turns out she has a new project. So she was just doing a lot of promotion for that. So her new project is called when I get home you can go and listen to that little Skies dropped Shelby. I think that this is his second official Studio project from not mistaken. I don't know if we have any little Skies fans that the listen to us, but I believe this is the second official Studio project. So going to listen that if you're a little Skies fan and finally the baby I just get so confused because there's there there's now a saturation of babies out there. We got a little baby then we got double baby. So it's very confusing at times. I like who the hell is is but he's a North Carolina native their child in North Carolina and he dropped his new project called Baby on baby. So very interesting title for a project but those are the notable new releases for the week of March 1st currently its March forth as we're recording. Adding this but these are all the release that came out the week of March 1st. So let's get into the music news. First knew that we have here is Tyrese. Mr. Tyrese is slated to play Teddy Pendergrass and the biopic Now by all pigs have become like very very popular. I think that more and more people were seeing like that. People are very very interested to see some of these stories from the people. You may not know much about you like the inside scoop go through everything that Of that they have been to in their lives and I don't care how many people clown Tyrese I think that he's a good singer. I think that he's a good actor as well. I know he did get called The Fast and Furious stuff, but I mean that's where he made all the bread as I ain't mad and forgetting all their bread and stink it up stick it with the series as long as he did, but Tyrese obviously has been in other movies as well. Like baby voice is probably where everybody remembers him from but he said that Teddy Pendergrass actually asked him to tell his story before you passed away. Not a one thing that I've always. Always had a problem with that. I had an issue with it when it comes to biopics it when you don't actually ask anybody who was around the person or you don't ask the person himself. If you're just going to like make us up as she go that's not a good biopic in my case. But in this particular case with Teddy Pendergrass, he actually is going to have Joan Pendergrass which is Teddy Pendergrass his widow Teddy Pendergrass. By the way. He passed away in 2010. And he's going to have little Marvin is going to come on and write the screenplay and this is all supposed to be Do this by Lee Daniels which pretty much as his hands and everything, so I'm not surprised that Lee Daniels it's going to do this but this biopic but I thought this was interesting though. We have no date as to when it's going to come out. But this is this is all the news that we have so far. So, how do you feel about Tyrese playing Teddy Pendergrass antibiotic?	0.0

So I do time. The first time was amazing. It was three months to the day after the shark attack and I just had two stitches and Staples out of my leg. And all I wanted to do was get back in the water and two of my mates came over and they took me down to Bondi with a couple of surfboards and I was really paranoid about it because As a really populated beach in so I felt embarrassed and self-conscious and I've got my eight foot board under my arm and the paparazzi were there taking photos and so it was pretty hard to deal with but I'm hoping down through the soft sand and I get to the water and I can maneuver my way to about waist deep and I put my board down and the only thing I was worried about was I just whispered to myself. Please don't let me paddle around in a circle. I didn't I nearly drowned smashed by every single way. But eventually I got out the back and I was in the song sitting on my board with my mates and it felt so freaking good and you know, I try to remind myself that a lot when the running blade actually hurts a lot when I run I don't enjoy running that much anymore. But I remember how good I felt after I made that huge effort to get down to the beach to Get out into the waves, you know, it's not always about the struggle of doing something. It's about the happiness at the end and knowing and they're just living and that that it motivates me to get up off my ass a lot of the time when the alarms going off at 5:00 and I'm like, I don't want to go to the gym. It's cold out and but I know that feeling will come as soon as I'm out there doing it and living and so I always give myself a bit of a mental uppercut and Y'all started live. I've never ever regretted that but I've definitely regretted not doing things.	1.0

Okay deaf, and Alice is surely now. Yeah, sounds like Shirley, but to be honest I get inspired a lot from Contemporary videos or like hip-hop so something that's not Ballroom sometimes of course, like if I'm doing a ballroom practice or something, I'll look at like that. So my favorite girls and I'll just like watch them and see the way they move their bodies and get inspired but a lot of my inspiration comes from hip hop dancers and especially people like his funny but like, you know, Casey rice. Yeah, I know keys right here comes Shawn and Casey are she has no idea who I am, but it's okay, but I'm a put it out there in love with the way. She's connected to her body and especially people like I don't really know her like Jade Jade Chenoweth. Yeah, I'm not really familiar with her. But her work is just I love the way. she's like she's committed into what she does wrong and Fierce and Powerful years people like that really inspire me people like Beyonce when she releases those videos and she has like her hair flying like that also inspires me like her Persona inspires me and I want to be like that like that kind of girl in that Ballroom field because a lot of times like you don't really see ballroom dancers out there, you know and feel like I want to inspire people the way these icons Inspire us, you know, like people like I like that Fela or Beyonce.	1.0

It's yeah, it's they're trying to saturate the market that's always kind of been there thing, which is also the one of the main reasons. I didn't want to buy Battlefield 5 because it's like it's they've been trying to saturate the market so much which is also like one reason I'd be kind of scared for Apex because it's like, you know how much now that now that it's making money because let's admit like one of the reasons EA didn't give a crap about this game beforehand is because they didn't believe in it, but now that it's making money. I'm scared for respawn because how much are there going to start trying to manipulate you spawn and like I was actually talking with Nate and just wasn't on air. I don't think but I was actually talking to Nate and I was like, you know, well like $18 for a skin that's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. It's a gun come on and I wondered to myself now respawn obviously stated that EA had no hand in making the game, but when it comes to the monetization how much of a hand is he a hat?	0.0

Living like literally thriving I'm having so much fun. And so we're like, let's call an Uber. Let's do it. And she's like one more tequila shot. I was like sure so we down it he's looking at me like I have ten heads. He's like this girl cannot drink because I've literally I've known that I'm like, I cannot hold my liquor like, oh, you're a small human. Yeah. So well, I was even smile my God. I was even smaller than like, it was crazy. Like now I'm lightweight. Yeah, so it was so bad. I would have like three glasses of wine and I'm still guy still get hammered after three glasses of wine now, but yeah, so it was it was wild. So like imagine me after 12 tequila shots.

Listen to fall into a life of sin, you know, and that's the thing, you know our life as Believers. We've been called to a higher standard and then you know on top of that, you know, if you if you want to go the extra mile and you want to be a person you feel that you're called into Ministry.

We agree and I'm so excited for this draft because I don't foresee any more big move from the Packers prior to the draft. I just don't think they have the ammo that they're willing to part with and then also the financial flexibility is a little bit less now that they've kind of, you know revamp the defense through free agency, which is honestly is all going according to my perfect plan for the Packers offseason. And that was to supplement the defense with veteran free agents and then go into the draft and address the off. That's with depth offensive pieces. So I'm very excited for good cuz he can do anything he wants to do, you know, he's going to have to work with patent and the floor to make these decisions and get get this team back to their Championship status.	1.0

Yeah. So yeah, he's like guns or religion to me. And he's like all these specific things that he couldn't do. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I wasn't sure how cool he was. I felt like they're trying to do like kind of like a drive Vibe Ryan Gosling for Drive type 5, which I liked but then that's the vibe that if anything goes wrong, he's definitely capable of fixing it, even though he gets really fucked up. Yeah, but I right he's been he's been like Daddy by a couple of characters who are either smarter than him or whatever. Hmm. So but I guess you know, I got to have like that humanizing element as you watch him kind of learned sure.	1.0
Wait, well, the funny thing is in the periphery you have I mean everywhere you have the same type of problem Google department and greater region inequality. Right? But in the periphery these problems are stronger, especially the redistribution problem at the if you look at people initially the upper class in Italy. There is a greater difference between them and the lower classes in in Germany. Hmm. Or in Spain or Portugal and so on so probably all right. The problems should explode in the periphery and there's an exploding for free as you know that Greece Spain is very particular. I'm very iterative of Spain right there all the way through this crisis. There is a lot of coverage but then the society it's definitely not something they literally went through things that the Greeks for instance did not would not tolerate the silent could say the same for our the Irish.	0.0

There's a lot going to people's birthday parties and I just was like, I can't like if I heard your voice from behind a door, I would know it was you. Yeah regardless of where I was. Yeah, so I just don't I don't I don't understand I get that. It's a kid show. And like at the time I didn't think much of it but it's just come on. Yeah, I mean I understand for her classmates as a little different but again, like you said something supposed to be that way. Yeah. Oh, I know this is stupid, but I noticed when Donzi left and they were still like out in the parking lot area. They have Fountain that's just full of flowers. No water so funny.	0.0
I love what you said because so to answer your question from earlier like a lot of people think okay. If I if I ditch the diet mentality, which I'll name as the first principle of intuitive eating. eating is stepping away actually from those diets from the strict rules about what's quote-unquote good or bad for you and instead giving yourself permission to include all different types of foods in your life in a way that promotes balance and you know, just Variety in general so To answer the question. Can I eat whatever I want? It's like yeah, you can you can eat whatever you want. But if you truly are in tune with yourself and listening to your body, as you said Casey, I would I would imagine and I've experienced and I know a lot of people I work with have experience that you do want to eat more foods that make you feel good because when you are connected to how you feel after certain foods, you're less likely to just eat, you know foods that drain that energy or that make you feel Early tired sure, you're going to eat them sometimes but I think people have this idea that like if I didn't have this super intense discipline around what I ate, I would just like, you know stock up on french fries and Twizzlers all day and I think we need to give ourselves more credit than that.	1.0
She wore them a gift. She wore those boots from the	1.0
Okay. Well, who knows that a funny story It's gotta be appropriate.	1.0
All right. Check. All right. All right, but that Batman and Robin movie is I saw the Batman Forever. I didn't see that I never saw that in the theater, but I saw Batman Forever in the theater and even that I was like this is fucking atrocious Batman and Robin just takes it to a new level imagine George Clooney at that time being like he had nipples on the suit.	1.0
Yeah, and she's like, let's do it. I'm going to be in California. You're going to be in California. Let's meet up or going to use his Studio. Here's a gorgeous space.	1.0
Yeah, I think so. I mean it's certainly the best intro recorded so far.	1.0
In this would be phylogenic. Would it not in terms of Casey in terms of am I using that? All right. Yeah. It's an honor can't unlearn but I think a problem is that we need to remember also just talking behaviourally for a second it remember food is Food Water oxygen sex Jinx, of course, we both say that one believe activity. These are all unconditioned reinforcers like you are born from day one known as to teach you these things are valuable to you, right? You are born from day one saying okay. This is like this is something that I like write it maintained your behavior if you cried and you got food. Wow, I'm going to cry more. I'm going to get food again. So this happens but what we've set up is and this has been that we naturally need we've created this idea that food should be are like reinforcer for doing something like oh, yeah, I I started with my pajamas today. I went to the gym today now I get to eat right or like I starved myself six days out of the week. Now. I can go ham and put every single thing that I like could have spread out them across the entire week into one weekend or you know, and I think that like, I think that Maybe Society has also shaped the way that we look at Food whereas it should be something that is like you need. This is a human need is really I marry yeah, these are primary and unconditioned reinforcers. You need it and we're looking at it as that's our reward, right? Like how many people are like, I mean, I remember just yeah, I'm sorry. I mean not I'm sorry. I meant I'm sure you remember and yells also going to be embarrassed. I mentioned this. But your sorority days back before you were this hippie chick like you always were this girl at heart but I'm saying I remember even talking about it with you. Like how many girls would go the entire week not eating anything just so they could get super drunk on like and go. What was it Big Slice?	0.0
There's more to this coaching stuff than just running practice and playing games.	0.0

And at first I was like, oh,	0.0
Yeah. I think the stakes are much higher and the industrial environment. It's on the business disruption side. So lost Revenue, Related to construction activity. That's a huge driver as well as just the magnitude of their construction spin. So they're looking at it from both sides right there looking at it from how long is it going to take to construct this new plant or retrofitting existing plant? And what's the overall cost of construction services that I'm going to you know that I'm gonna spend on construction services over the next 10 years and and they are capital planning on that type of arising Capital planning in commercial. Environments tends to be a shorter Horizon. And so that also then also challenges how we think about Innovation and work programs in things that we can do to make the construction delivery process more effective like off-site construction. And I also think the dollar spent is smaller as well. Like you said you might have one off buyers or Construction Services or even if they're not one off they may build a project every five years. So you're essentially are a one-off type Builder or they're planning Horizon is Noah's law. So if Multi family developer or Builder cash right now. You're probably saying I hope I hope the music keeps playing for another 24 36 months and I'm running out this wave of multifamily boom, and I'm not really quite sure where this Market will be five years from now, whereas oil and gas and petrochemical owners there. They've got a 10 15 20 year view on the capital spent where that's going.	0.0
You pull hose with Eddie and you can run a two and a half actually quite well using it like soda solo. You know, I know there's a couple techniques like what we call when we call the Jimi Hendrix that it that is taxing on you. It is tiring did use that method just it's To remove two and a half by yourself standing up. It does deplete you put the this negative when I when I used it as actually it's quite quite a lot easier to handle hose that big run a full. Yeah. So motifs that makes them kind of other cool stuff door wedges and things check them out on their website. We're supposedly getting some new stuff.	1.0
So we'll see that's that's I do wish I had done something with animals, but maybe at some point when I when I stopped helping not get involved with I ever become rich and famous from this podcast you and I can open up an animal shelter.	1.0
It's ER it's pretty far but we were able to split it up under like three or four nights and we just kind of we like visiting these little museums and the bread make a nigga was fun out of it was and the car that I had like a Scion at the time. I'm and like that thing was just wheelie and all the way on wait a minute. Yeah, did we know that we both had Saiyans at one point? What was it? I had a Scion tC. Yeah, he's black TC. I had a black XP. That's why I don't think I don't think we've ever talked about this. I don't think we have we'll do a whole episode on silent. They don't even make them anymore. Mine was basically a Pepsi can on Wheels is what I kind of thought of it was a hollow a scar Paolo. I liked that. It was a hollow car basically, so now he was cool. So at the time, you know, I moved out Here I didn't have a plan on the way out. I did apply for a job at Backcountry.com and a lot of my friends at the time work there as well. And I was thinking, you know, I'll just apply and I'll work in the call center. You know, right? I'll talk gear. I know gear I ride for companies. This is great yadda. And on the drive out. I actually about six hours away. I got a call and I got the job. He does awesome. So that was really cool. And at the time a job was a job. I was just going to snowboard and I always had film and you know video to you. No lie back on it in case something didn't work out. Which was really really cool. So I don't feel like in school. I learned as much as I could have. Yeah, but I knew once I started going in the right field and working for people that I could keep developing those skills, right? So what was really cool about Backcountry as is I was there for two months and I get an email about job openings via email like internal and one of the jobs was for video and I'm like, okay, they're building out a new video program. This is great. This is this is a big opportunity for me. I apply instantly boom. I don't hear back for a month I hit. Back, I'm like, there's no way I got this but it's worth.	1.0
I think the number one way to start practicing intuitive eating is to just begin to notice when you make decisions about what you're going to eat. What are the factors that are coming into play that that come up for you as you're making that decision? So as we talked about if you're sitting down at a restaurant and you immediately think okay, what's the you know, quote unquote healthiest or like lowest calorie option.	1.0
Yeah, so I don't remember Were the formulas or any of that stuff? I was I think I went a hundred and thirty feet was the deepest ever did and at that level you went twice that it felt. So weird like everything compressed. I remember I had to keep tightening my weight belt because everything shrinks from the pressure. Yeah you deeper and you get knocked.	1.0
Wait, this is team Harris team of the decade with no current walls playwright player.	1.0
It's like having a vacation.	1.0
So just some random thoughts on how I get comfortable to clean, but the less clothing that I have on the better. Basically, let's see taking out the kitchen trash. That's something that I often do to make sure that my house is smelling good we take out the trash every day. We don't live in an area where they have the same. Separate recycle bins.	1.0
It's a convertible. Well that and like there's no way Jackson could afford a car like that.	0.0
I keep telling my friends. I almost feel quite lonely in it because nobody else understands what I'm going through necessarily. Yeah, and it's fine. I'm not like going through stuff but like but at the same time, I'm like, yeah, I wake up every morning and people are screaming that I'm going to hell and like it just kind of feels like garbage to my soul sometimes.	0.0
Yay. Had a fuckin eat, right?	1.0
So coming back to you your point about deflation, which is something that I was considering to be the most likely initial outcome. Before we get some kind of inflationary bust and perhaps a collab complete collapse in currencies, which would love to get your view on in just a second. But so I can get my head round. How how does a deflationary environment unfold when there is so much QE going on there is so much intervention going on the so much debasement of these currencies and at the same time. I mean we're seeing Currencies and becomes like gold move up. How could these how could this actually mechanically happen?	0.0
I like to make sure that I'm comfortable and a lot of times that means being cool enough.	1.0
I'm not going to sing a lot Bennett but a lot of the time it is you never did. No you are right, but those two are and Cody the Freer and natural with the ball at the fit. They're all they're all midfielders. So it's natural that we are going to retain possession better under distribution is going to be better. I mean the out ball is a lot better, especially Block then Duncan part of his leftovers, right? So yeah, I think we've adjusted seamlessly tight body's not even not even gone but even got he's got to come back straight to the team.	1.0
But the thing that's what I was thinking.	1.0
I have HBO besides didn't HBO's one thing I would get some a fucking HBO slut. I love H. AI love each leg Yeah, so I would do that because that's like they have so many shows that are there. Is that are all good.	1.0
I was young little bit cocky. I guess you could say because I'm this things.

What have you I would pick up the floor if there's anything there bonus if there's nothing on your bathroom floor, maybe you don't have kids. Or they're older or well-disciplined. You know, I'd like to think my kids are well disciplined.	1.0
That's it and then and voicemails if you have the time go have to check voicemail. Do you might have my queen I have a ton of original sin' you Hey, listen man a voicemail for to backed up we will get to it. Yeah, but if we do have space then we might then we will then we'll read it on the plane will listen to it. You can be part of the show you could reach that upper echelon of content creation that makes feels like is the only thing keeping us out of a bubble right now. That's right.	1.0
Just like this is fucking kid in a sideways tribe shirt. But this kid Walker it wasn't can walk it away. Amber Alert. They tell you. Oh my God. I tell you what, there was an amber alert, and it was my car like the description was my car. Oh my God, I didn't kidnap the kid. I didn't kidnap a kid, dude. Did you guys hate it when you have an amber alert, and it's you Your car I just try to be relatable. No, I meant it was an amber alert that happened to be my car, which is very generic and I like was gonna go somewhere but I was like, maybe on second thought maybe on second. Thought I'll stay home. We'll take an Uber. You gotta start thinking about these things with a beard. You know, I'm done.	0.0
Yeah, so we go tomorrow and then we stay there and then we're there Thursday, I think so. It's going to be a little bit stressful. They're not going to have as much time together as they usually would but she can be fine.	1.0
I was reaching for my champagne. I was like, I'm sorry, I enjoyed the episode because like we've never seen this challenge before so it's pretty new. I loved like I guess it was a comedy challenge to get some way. So it was Personality. Yeah.	1.0

I have to say as University. All right. Thank you so much.	1.0
Yeah, I felt like pretty good. We had a pretty good crew in the in the hall. Yeah. It's a big thing that I've been working in. My normal job. A lot is a lot of Education and Training people on the locks own and just changing a lot of the stigmas and the Misinformation out there voted as well because everything is a miracle drug and and you know, there's lots of things that people are ingesting and so are smoking or or injecting and in our locks on will not actually reduce or reverse those effects with more people think that if somebody takes something and they've overdose that naloxone is the golden ticket is not so lots of good information with that.	1.0
So we got the weightlifting class and the level 2 and that helped me the most right but the level 2.	1.0
I don't think I've ever even seen him wear jeans in that's in the opening shot. He's gone wild because he do he has it. He's in the hospital and he's got his white coat. He's got jeans on ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding that's fucking that's cause I didn't do it right but that was the I had the spirit of correctly do it right.	0.0
Well, that's just it's all public education. Right? I mean, there's so many opinions with it like you got a lot of harsh opinions and well, why are you helping some of these overdosed, you know like but like I said like with when somebody approaches me, I just tell them they look like I've literally my career I've had to resuscitate like 14 year olds from Man overdosed in the past and it wasn't intentional like they're not a drug user. It was a first-time experiment that went South man. Everybody's got a mom and dad right? And so they're very happy that we brought them back. So there's a there's a lot of information on there just needs to the public needs to be aware of and it could be anybody could be completely accidental.	0.0
But I wrote that down but then later I wrote down the the dog was definitely a plot device because the whole point of having the dog was that	1.0
Alright. Well, thank you for listening and we will see you next week. See you later. Hi.	1.0
They are the top and it's just it's the point where I was always like, okay, like that's enough.	0.0
Yeah. Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to show that measured The Bite in my wet suit and my leg said that it was between two point seven three meters. So so about 9 foot 9 or 10 foot long. So it was it was Much bigger than I was just sure sheer power.	1.0
So you just said that like Tupac was initially tabbed as Malik. So how did you slide in and get that?	1.0
Okay, so sometimes when I fold and put away all my clothes, it can be frustrating when there is not room in my drawers for the clothing. So and I don't know if this is going to be relatable for many of you are not but sometimes I need to go through my Roars and hang some things up to make room for things that I want to keep in the drawers because I have more room in my closet than I do in my dresser and I don't want to get another dresser dressers are expensive and I already have a couple plastic units with drawers like one of them is in my master closet.	0.0
this is such a trip like we're all just doing our best and figuring things out at like a really Scribbly way and my thing it's like I forget everything I learn all the time. And so having people sort of bear witness to you and how you're doing and remember for you and you remembering for them and like everyone can like hold up a loving mirror and ask questions about why you believe the things you believe like Human beings are designed to need each other. And what's dope about that is it like once that need is met like it feels really good and it feels really safe and it feels really complete. And so even if you feel like a maniac especially if you're like a woman, especially if you are like a woman of color or you are just not like you're like average cishet, you know, like monoculture like mono conscious person who's like quote normal or a quote like skin-toned, you know, like yeah, like it's just a way to like take small defiant actions to like take up space and to like reaffirm your own agency, you know, not dump not like pollute not take advantage, but just like command that attention. Um and have and like amplifying other people and inviting them to do it to like, you know, I'm literally sitting here recording a mini pod on the floor about asking how are you like that's where I like that's the key to Wellness. Like it really really helps me and it's free. You know, so I hope you find some utility in that and I hope you have a gentle day and I hope you find small reassuring ways to accept the flavor of brain that you have in like hopefully grow to love it and appreciate it.	1.0
So I have to say I'm really sorry that this happened like that we brought on an investor on our show. That's this flaky.	0.0
- right. Yeah, say hello and have a quick conversation with him. Brandon was talking about the fact you guys are headed to Disneyland this week to film which I think is going to be so incredibly exciting and I was like, I would just want to go down there and watch because you guys have no idea what's coming. It's gonna be insane in a the best way possible you get to work with Zach woodlee Have you ever worked with fact before?	1.0
She was kind of it was just I just didn't although I did the thing about this plot that I did like was when they cut to Jackson and Lily on the couch back at the house. That was kind of yeah, I like that and she really was like, why'd you put on wrestling and he was like, this is the award show. That was funny.	1.0
It could I think I'm going to believe in like you leave the classics alone. I think you could take like the bits and pieces of the story line and modernize it. You know, I don't know if you continue it.	0.0
It's not really in bulk. But you don't use the whole package at once by especially like for beans and rice.	0.0
Yeah, so that's really good. And so now we interviewed someone who you know fairly well fairly recently interviewed his broke by the name of Carl for see how you know, come a little bit its colors my partner.	1.0
And then, you know, then they can sort of talk about how they feel and and then like again because people are so in used to it.	1.0
I hadn't realized my husband looked at me and he was like, oh man. I have not seen this side of you in quite a while right could anyway, so here's the thing though, right? It is often easier to strike out in frustration and accuse someone else than to admit. MIT an error and ask for forgiveness like in this is kind of what sir, I did to write like she arranged for Abram to take hag are and and was like give me a baby in the husband's like well, okay, like like whatever you want, right? Um, but then she's angry about it.	0.0
And I wanted to put yeah, but then they'll be like what a good bunch of copycats don't like.	1.0
Are you scared time to start dming you want to do do a Kickstarter to raise a thousand bucks or a couple thousand bucks for flights. And we do this live in California with all the boxer guys. You can do a little we can do this real shit.	0.0

So then yesterday I did another 10 minutes add another 5 minutes. And again, it's feeling pretty promising. I'm pretty confident. Yes, no real issues as of yet.	1.0
I don't think that's just kids right? So like It's a little bit different when you have kids you been conditioned by work and having kids the but yeah, it's like but on a Saturday you're like, I want half.	1.0
All right, so is is for me it's a 50/50 thing 50/50 in that, you know, I was 17 so I didn't know shit about nothing. Right and it's that's naive Tay that you have that when you're that young that I think protects you from the realities of the entertainment business now personally, I always thought we was making fire because of what the movie was. I was like yo, this is like our life, you know what I mean? Like I could relate so much to the film that I felt like I would go see this, you know, but then you know, this is me saying it in hindsight, but you just there's so many variables that come into you know, the filmmaking process the timing the market Yada, yada yada, but personally I always felt it was going to be fired. You know what I mean? Because I was a part of the process again. I'm on set with pot we doing this scene. We doing that scene and storylines going here going there. I thought it was dope.	1.0
No, I'm just saying them being on the same side as you for your oh, please everybody is scared of emptying the Diaper Genie.	0.0
You know, it's funny about that is nobody really knew I really didn't I mean my mom knew but it was just my peers in school. Like I still have my boys on the Block and he's just like, you know go to performing arts and I was just quiet with my wall and then you know, I had my boy Boys that I grew up with that we went we all went to the same High School my boy mom and my boy Mitch so we shared that thing and and I mean it for me it happened pretty quickly. Exactly. Yeah. I got out of high school a book juice and that's when he was like, oh like you really like trying to do his acting thing and I was like, yeah, but um, you know, I've been I've been blessed ever since. So how did you book juice juice was what they call a cattle call. So I so I you know, Got out of school and I was one of those and take a year off get a job kind of figure out, you know, I didn't I didn't know if I want to go straight to college one of my boys went to how and I was just like I'm gonna kick it around in the city audition heard about this audition went and it was like, I don't know how it seemed like it was like a thousand people there go in read they called me back read again. It was like every call back. It was a smaller group and it was a lot of chi don't remember how many callbacks but I wouldn't be surprised if he was something like 15 called like something out there and then there was like there was like eight of us that they were kind of like trying to put will you to read this role and you read that role and then they had a dinner and I remember my manager at the time she was like, you know, they really hot on this guy 2-pack 2-pack shocker and I was like what you just like whatever you do try to sit next to that guy because they really love love that. And of course as it would play out we sat on opposite ends of the table, you know what I mean, but after we had this dinner and everybody just vibed out and about couple days later. I got a call from Ernest Dickerson. He said hey man got some good news. Looks like you got the part and I was like really and was like it. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life.	1.0
Well, I was going to ask if I mean the back free I think that was one of the first times really we saw Cody then Duncan say sort of look pretty pretty solid. I know we've had previous games. We've spoke about it the Arsenal game and so on but forward touch on it now before we move on to the next game, how do you lot think that I know they didn't play that back for you today? But how do you lot think we've adjusted? Life without Willie Bali as well because I personally think it's doing a lot better than what I am.	1.0

So, what is this? Hey video game a video game switcher brushing to the other side of the top of your mouth and keep brushing. A video game is a game kids or grown-ups play on a computer. That computer could be a gaming system a phone or a tablet people make video games. I writing code the code might tell the characters in the game what to do when a player presses certain buttons. Like if I hit the up button my character in the game will jump level up your brushing by switching to the bottom of your mouth and give your tongue a brush, too. Here's your next riddle.	1.0
I like that.

So before I became a trainer, I was working at Cold Stone Creamery for Five years and that was you know, I had a great job there taught me a lot of character. I was cleaning every night taught me to bring the energy but how personal training came about was. I was training my mom and my dad one Saturday morning at Cal Fit and I was stretching them in the manager walked by and he approached me and said that I wasn't allowed to like instruct or tell them what to do because it would be a liability but He offered me an opportunity and he said if you take the certification through our club you could be a trainer for us and pass the certification and the rest was history. It's been four years since I've been trying to now it's crazy.	1.0

Right and we most of the time we don't understand how God's plan or his. Promise is going to work out but we need only to be obedient to what he's calling us to like that first step right not having to have it all figured out anxiety stress overwhelm. This all comes like in our life. I know in my life when I try to take when I try to figure out all the details right like when I try to be in control of everything or Get super impatient while waiting for God. In in in when Waiting for God period right like I know that I can become very impatient. Like if I'm like, okay. Yeah. God is definitely calling me to this like let's make it all happen overnight. All right, like I am so impatient. Oh man, but it says Be Still In know I am God. So this is actually in Proverbs or in Psalms. I'm sorry.	1.0

Thanks very much indeed. Line up by now that was fascinating absolutely loved it. So interesting really really interesting just before we came on air you were mentioning the House of Commons. Yeah, the I think we must be watching this. I forget the Channel's name because it was either the BBC News Channel or BBC Parliament and possibly both because we ended up switching off at about 10 o'clock in the evening and we started watching roughly lunchtime and I I tuned in to catch boris's statement returning from New York after the Supreme Court ruling and actually it was almost one of those entertaining afternoons of my things in my life. So for anyone asked to see me, you must watch if it's not the full show that at least the highlights of Jeffrey cocks the Attorney General because it was absolutely a PST A Pas du tout pas de resistance. Unbelievably full-blown that the whole works in the guys going to this is amazing roaring baritone anyway, but he just he just blew blew the opposition away. I think there were there were heavy expectations coming into yesterday because we're recording this on Thursday the 26th 26th of September. So it's a few days just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the Pierogi of Parliament and there's an expectation coming. Into the commons that know that they were going to Duff up the attorney general and follow up by duffing up Boris and my god did those expectations get reversed very very quickly. So first the Jeffrey Cox in this is fantastic and hilarious and then you have you know, the man himself. So Boris came in and basically just gave no quarter and there's a very appreciate what Dido just said about social media. He's absolutely right, but if you do have the To engage with say Twitter. There is a very special pleasure that can come with engaging with Twitter while simultaneously watching a big event and the Parliamentary session was a big event. So it's almost that's that's what it's designed. Almost all yeah always had become as a mixture of Theater Grand guignol black comedy. I don't know how to describe it. I'll be I'll be looking at grand grand. What does that thing? I couldn't tell you I decided to extend impressive but the Macabre so I've always interpreted, but I don't You know the full definition Barack possibly. I'm just starting at mindless French words now either. What's I don't know what's happening and being taken over by Spirit of Madness. But Boris launches at there was no Contrition. No apology was General Gregory an to the power of infinity and during during the proceedings. Basically, he's worked out perfectly how to be the world's most successful troll on the back of perhaps the success of gone. From so he started using the phrase surrender Bill about the Hilary Benn act which is basically means to be can't can't leave without a deal and every time he used the term surrender Bill the opposition benches would just get would just get more and more Angry. So course you would then continue to use the phrase surrender bills that why you change your Twitter hand. So I've changed my Twitter handle to surrender a bill cousin of surrender bill, but last night I was just having the funniest. Time of it and then I thought okay. Let's really go for it. And I said could everybody please stop using the word surrender Bill hashtag surrender Bill and then I think followed up with the first rule of surrender bill is due not mentions do not talk about surrender Bill. The second rule of surrender will is do not talk about surrender Bill and those have been my most popular tweets ever. So everyone has been filed in and it was extraordinarily funny how that must is so much fun. But on honest on a slightly more sobering note D. The one thing that Also kind of a last night was I think was Barry Sherman and some woman who is named. I don't even want to remember from the Labour party the amount of hostility rage blind rage real hateful rage that came back up Boris is it was a sight to believe and for what? It's worth. I'm and I'm clearly on one side of debate among arm the pro breaks it side but it struck me that I think labor and the lib Dems have called the public mood a hundred percent wrong on this so when they're saying own, Where the language is in temperate and in moderate and all the rest of it? I think they're no because what Boris was doing yesterday was he was giving a like a sort of a Channel of venting for those of us those Seventeen point four million people who basically felt completely cheesed off the last three and a bit years and he's actually no lightning rod for the for the opposition but an opportunity for those those sitting there not a trivial number of people who frankly have felt cheated and betrayed and he's now he's now just Taken the taken the fight to Parliament in those small way. I know anything can happen. But what do you what do you think the next steps are II couldn't even begin to say because I mean, I'm no expert in Parliament procedure and there's been but apparently neither. Does anybody else this writing the laws now as they go on I saw a headline saying that Boris had lied to the queen or something is that these terms are very nuanced. So I'm again stress. I'm no expert but my take on it is that at Boris had perfectly Sound Advice perfectly credible advice from his legal people including the Attorney General to do what he did your ocean to the mechanics as that basically said dismissing Parliament to then reinstating it the later date and that was all deemed to be sufficiently legal for him to go ahead and meet the queen and then the Supreme Court Bear in mind that also a number of very high-profile local British Justice. People also approved it and then the Supreme Court 11 to nothing decided that it was it was technically unlawful. But I think is Boris himself said what's really happened is that the legal system has been brought in it to a pine on these it has no matter talking about it has nothing to do with politics. This is the last thing you really want to happen in terms of the UK the British constitution. It is not for the courts to decide what parliamentary procedure ought to be. Like it's none of their business and you know, because we've got hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent to draw upon and people are now that that is exactly what gido is talking about in relation to the elites. Now when the elites had cornered they will do absolutely anything to you know to ensure that they win. Well, I think in this case this is this is a classic example of a Battle Royal where neither side is backing down, but the difference is know that there was a simple majority the leave And that simple majority a total of 17 and a half million people have been ignored for us three years. So no surprise that they're angry that I'm angry. And so there's a phrase that John Lanchester used it in one of his pieces a while back guy who writes for London of your books that somebody going to quote ridiculous Basil's 40-ish lengths unquote to achieve something and that's what the remain cap of done. So they're driving a coach and horses through historical precedent through law. You're through normal parliamentary life through everything just to overturn a perfectly legitimate vote. It's quite sickening. Really. Are you have some I know some people who are remain has and I get I detect that they are starting to get weary with it as well. You know Whitney nothing. Yeah, if we're not careful something get killed. Well, I say that in all sincerity. I don't mean it to have her that wanted to happen. But if trust me when you see the footage of certain labor and peas just that does blind with Fury just lashing out at Boris is deeply unsettling. Well, we can still get there. Can we is that particular YouTube and I've had some this morning on some more happy topics. I just want to say a couple of shout. Shouts first of all to Dixie Deville on YouTube.

That sounds great because I'm worthless anyways, and I don't have any purpose anyways, and yes, and I think one of the things I learned from going to therapy was that I'm really good at playing at a situation that's occurred. And then I try to like then I replay that story over and over and over in my head of well, why did they say it that way or how did what did I do wrong? And it's always what did I do wrong? And then I'm basically become Steven Spielberg and I've like made all these movies in my head of how they should have gone or could have gone. And I've been like look down. Like I've just spent two hours consumed by a probably that something that's not even real that nobody cares about. Yeah.

Oh, yeah, you got it. It's like it's actually super easy for me to pinpoint the moment where I knew I wanted to like put, you know moving images on a screen and that would be in the Summer of 1991 when I went to the theater and saw Terminator 2 Judgment Day. How old were you in? 1990-1991 I would have been I was 13, I guess 13 I guess I was too man. So it was my wife.	1.0
So I would just another fan outside of that I think because when I when I was doing my research I'm back in the day. I kept hearing about oh called The Wolf he's evil and he's terrible at I'm like really seems fine to me. He loves Derek's or why not and started doing just some digging and I noticed that the second that people started talking to you and by people, I mean industry people insiders people involved with the show. That's when things kind of started to go sour on the steric side, and I think That that 100% is because of jealousy basically and then they're like, well, you know who's pulling him stuff? Why does he get to know anything and that's usually kind of how that starts.	0.0
Exactly. Well, I also think that's a common state of behavior. Like we could put this behaviorally into deprivation right when you deprive Yourself as something then how much more do you want to write? Like you're like, I can't be having this now. That's all I want. Right? I mean that's how it works. I mean it's even a simple as like don't think of a pink elephant now don't you want the Pink Elephant the think in your head so like I see how this works. Also. I assume when you're trying to stick to all these diets and like you create these contingencies if I'm only gonna reward myself when I do this for how many days I mean Casey what's one of the I feel like you've done like Whole 30? Yeah. Definitely. I've done probably everything and Whole 30. I actually thought was pretty good to just figure out if you had any sensitivities and I don't know if I'm that is something that you see But like eliminating like the top kind of things from your diet just to see if it does affect you right and then slowly reintroducing it. I like that style. But again, you are you're limiting yourself so you can't have carbs can't have gluten. So then guess what? All you freaking want is a pizza, right? Like you're like, I can't have it like, oh my God right versus that open flexibility or the psychology the psychological flexibility of being like I can have it if I want it does it? Serve my body right now. Is it going to make me feel good? Do I know the consequence of when I eat pizza? I feel sluggish. I may have you know, some Diet, you know some potty issues. So yeah, I like I love this is great.	1.0
It's a good game and I felt so bad for respawn not getting the attention they deserved and I was actually looking forward to Titanfall 3 and I think I was I just happened to stumble over a live stream. That was the day they announced Apex nice. So I downloaded the day came out and I've been playing it since yeah, definitely.	1.0
And so that's what stop trying to put a round Peg. Us into a square hole, you know when that was a big thing with everyone all of the couples that I spoke to they all said we spoke the vision. We made it clear. Hey, this is the guy especially hey, this is what I'm called to do. Are you willing to go with me? I'm not trying to like, oh this one. I think it can work. I was in a personally I was in a relationship back in the day that I was like trying to figure it out like oh, you know, this person's not exactly what I thought when I mentioned Ministry, they like froze like a deer in headlights, but I think we could make it work, you know like Like you need it if you're called to go into full-time Ministry. You shouldn't be looking for someone who's like who doesn't wanna have anything to do with it. I just want to stay home with the kids someone who's like I've talked about before someone who's like working for the weekend, you know, I just love to travel. I love going on vacation. You need someone who's like willing to work like there's a mission at hand. Adam didn't get Eve so she could like spend all his money and take them on vacation. So you could take on vacation like there needs to be a purpose behind your marriage. Even if it isn't Ministry if it's like, hey, we're We're Kingdom Minded people and that's the whole purpose of this podcast is like get you to be Kingdom Minded like your life isn't get an education get a good job retire at 65 and enjoy life as much as you can. That's not the gospel. The gospel isn't enjoy life. The gospel is take up your cross and follow Jesus like your life on this Earth, you're gaining treasure in heaven. You're going to spend eternity and treasure and maybe if you're lucky a hundred years on this earth like at a hundred and eight years at I tried hundred and twenty years at Max but our life here on Earth is is short. This is a time of sowing and reaping for eternity that you are making choices now. And so your marriage should be geared in that direction. We one of the things that was said and I'll go over some of the Practical boundaries, but they said that they didn't want to be always on the defensive so they had clear boundaries. Hey, we're not going in the house together by ourselves. We're never going the bedroom together. Even if there are people in the house there were some practical things. You know, I think I think you shouldn't be making out with somebody like full-on like making out with somebody before you're married. I think you know, it's crazy. It's 2019. It's normal in this day and age even by Christian standards like it's cool to fool around a little bit like but draw the line for yourselves everyone that I talk to and these are people that I look at and say they have a they have a good marriage. They all said, you know, we had clear lines and if any of them said hey, what do you if you could do things differently it was hey, I wish we had drawn more. Clear lines. I wish it had been clear. I wish we would have I wish we would have I was I wish the boundaries would have been better. No one said, you know, I think our boundaries were too strict.	0.0

It's you really got to be true and honest with yourself to be able to do this in verses like, you know, comparing yourself to whether it be something you're seeing on social media or what you think that you should be doing or what your friend is doing for this like I feel like I should like green juice and I just effing done. Okay, like I Lee don't like kale drinks, okay or smoothie bowls for that. Yeah. I really what I prefer and I've learned this through my body.

audience is seeing it and you want to give them the same show that you guys kicked off a month before two months before and it was great because the people in the show were so great and it was such a small cast. I think it was only eight of us all together including Derek. So it was such a good intimate cast that it felt like such a small little family traveling America together. It was so cool. It was just always uplifting. We never had drama like it was just always super that's helpful to Super positive. Yeah.	1.0

Earlier in the season we weren't really I guess you could say and we're going to come out more live and have more passion.	0.0
I know lately. I've been using bars of soap in the master bathroom. My husband and I each have our own sink were pretty much the only people that use those things. I mean occasionally akid might wash their hands their if they used our restroom, but for the most part I have my own sink, he has his own sake and then the kids share a bathroom. So I decided that we didn't really need to have a pump of hand soap in the bathroom and I might change on this later. But right now I keep just a bar of soap but it's sink and one of the reasons I like to do that is sometimes if I'm getting ready in a hurry and I'm not going to take a shower that morning.	1.0
Yeah. I mean, I'm actually you kind of make me feel a little bit better about myself because I thought it was just me because literally this is how it happened it came out and I want to say I started the stream because I think it was what was it was either 11 or noon my time. And so I started the stream, of course my wife got off right around the same time, so I had to go get freaking groceries. But I only got uh game in I got a single game in I got two kills which you know for me was actually really cool. But I got I got both of the kills because of the jump at the first was in midair and then the other one was after I had landed so it felt really satisfying and I'm like sweet this is how I'm starting off the season then literally I go grocery shopping. I get home. I get some food for the kids, you know, like shut up go over there and he And then I start my stream again and just out like you said I just started getting slaughtered left and right it was to the point where like high morale was just so low and I'm just like, oh my God, I'm I'm trash I hate this and yeah, I mean like I feel a little bit better knowing that it's not just me that apparently was a lot of people because yeah, that was that was what happened with me. It was so yeah. Oh my God, I felt bad for a couple of reasons. I mean for one, obviously, I have a podcast where or like here's some tips and tricks and how to get kills and so to get slaughtered like that really really puts a damper on your mood. That's number one. But then number two is I'm trying to stream it. So like for anybody heard out there who doesn't know I'm a bus driver and this week happened to be this week happened to be spring break for the Boise school district or so. I'm like, okay, I don't have to go to work. This is awesome. I have a whole week division to Now they're dropping the battle pass. And so I was starting to try to get a little bit of a schedule for my twitch going. And so I started that but I'm doing horrible just absolutely terrible and it yeah, it felt horrible and I'm like the other side of the coin is the fact that it's like well, I'm trying to entertain people but it is so hard to entertain somebody when you're just not having a good time. I mean just losing one after another after another. I was just like okay, this is this deck dad's when I get it.	0.0
Well, it's Simon who lines because it's not offside. Yeah. It's a referee's decision. You have to blow the whistle when the phase of play is stopped because you can carry on and school like he did not what that's not OV.	0.0
But yeah, I've just been very rare very yeah, he's very rare thing when you can't blame those teams picked used to kick rather than swap sighs, you know, so yeah, I think today was will struggle to live with Sheffield, you know is energy levels. They were they were every second ball. They will get it and perhaps they are the a little bit hungover from first the people say the professional athletes playing two games in a week. She'll be an excuse. It's not an excuse to you come up against professional athletes or implied. At all in the way. Yeah, so there is going to be he's a difference there. But I thought Jeff Ward United in terms of how they play with pretty poor. It was direct. He's running the channels. It was it was crap football, but it's so effective not the only game where you look alike. They goal kicks. They push everyone up they make the volcano literally all the players were probably 10 10 meter radius of each other because they know they're going to win that second ball and I can get more they so much the second door.	0.0
Yeah, so I mean, I guess I could start it like the beginning of the present which was like actually having a career in video production and the first real job I got I was still in college when I got it was is hired by a company to do wedding videos and Ari. Yeah, I think anybody that's gone very far in the video production field has probably done wedding videos at one point or another great starting point.	1.0
So then we like I don't even know there was this other girl there and of course, I thought he was my boyfriend like obviously he didn't think so nor had he ever asked me or shown any signs of affection towards made him your boyfriend.

I'm not a liar the fact that you're an atheist. Yeah and like that. I recommend your channel to so many people who comment on my videos because yeah because like you do not at all represent the things that I am opposed to you know, like and I think it goes back to this idea of when I was a Christian and when I would kind of be going Like what you're going through trying to defend gay marriage and like all these things. I was always very analytical of this idea of God and in my head I was like if you're telling me that he's a loving God. I feel like we have to be able to attribute certain qualities to this deity. And so often when you are kind of like the girl to find girls who are living in this Christian bubble who like just read the scripture in her.	0.0
And you know the yeah as somebody who's never really been to like the Midwest or south at all like yeah, like the thought of that does kind of surprised me a little bit.

The Selby is God cast is brought to you by and this is just like such a difference and that's why like this wrote this this podcast is a roller coaster never want people to feel completely comfortable and if we can keep that as the general theme of this damn thing and I feel like we've done our jobs.	0.0

If it was very tough because that it felt like a lock when I walked off of the off of the stage. Yeah, and so initially it sucked and worst case scenario of everything bust that we've got a whole lot of other great things going on for us. So we're not you know, I can't I'm not going to dwell on that because I'd still be stuck there and not making the progress we're making right now.	0.0

We know, you know that kind of thing, but it's so interesting and like confusing because like during season 4 like sterics were not like we were not here for I didn't even watch these in for I watched literally the finale and only the finale because I got information that there's going to be a big steric moment in it. And I was told like there could be a hug or a kiss which there wasn't a hug or a kiss but it was a big steric moment and it was like, why is the show actively trying to like kill steric but then have a moment like that where you have Derek dying and so many different like the he was going back to Styles over and over and over again. Like she'll why is that in the show like who put that in there if you guys hated so much which I have wooden table fan.	0.0
It's just about it's about until it's just about Gathering as much as you possibly can you're Under One Roof. You can't leave your sweet or else you get swarmed by crazy people in the lobby. And so you just sit up there and you talk about different scenarios with your fellow front office members and you You talk to other teams and see what they're doing you talk to agents to see what other teams are doing. So that's what this is. And and I also think I mean, it's crazy. I'll and I know fans this is this is a different situation like last year. I think fans grew tired of the kluber Bauer stuff because it just seemed like it was a different report every day and then nothing ever happened. This is different. This is the face of your franchise. This is a franchise shifting decision one way or the other. You're setting yourself up for the next decade one way or the other so I get it. But also like I landed yesterday there were a couple like vague reports and a specific report from someone who's probably never even been to an Indian's game and like everyone's panicking and saying I bet something's going to happen in the next five ten minutes or like we're getting close where there's smoke there's fire and it's like don't be surprised if this lingers I mean this is yeah. This is not the sort of thing that just gets hashed out in one. Dinger one phone call over an hour like this is this is a lot of back and forth between two smart front offices. And again, like even if the if the Dodgers are like will give you Lux and we'll give you may and you give us kluber and Lindor and the Indians are like, we really like this deal like this is this is definitely what we need to do. They still should go and talk to other teams and be like, can you top this like this is going to take a while and I think there are a lot of keep saying hurdles are off. Pickles but there's just a lot of things that you have to check off before you make a trade like this and I won't believe it until incarcerated.	1.0
Well, I would probably get the government out of it. You kitchen I was just completely out of it all education.	0.0

Yeah, he's in he's in deep, but we in the episode with with Kevin and Betty and Charles where Kevin does say that he'll tell them. But given the fake information and find out where the farm is located. It looks like they're located at some Hotel on the other side of the maple Barons right there. Hold up of the bunch of arms and they're ready to make a stand. Yeah, so I guess I'm gonna have to go by what Kevin saying especially what we saw in a previous next week, right?	1.0
I see that okay this year, especially because like my baby girl, she's just like a different type of personality and we Have an interest in connection because it's like she's I just um, she just like me in a sense of out sometimes my wife gets frustrated and I'm like I go over I say three things and she's like, oh, okay and it works and she says I'm just like, I don't know we got this thing, you know that it works. But with yeah, my son is definitely because he's a mama's boy. And so it's a he's a great kid, but it really is challenging because you want as a man as I look at it. It's like, you know when you discipline your kids like the Appling you're going to receive outside of these walls of our house has no love attached to it. It's just cold. It's just you know what? I mean? So the discipline you receive with us. It's coming from a loving place. There's a lesson to be taught here as a lesson for you to learn and I think like as a man you like, you know, you want your son to be tough. You want to this she wanted to be that but I think you have to meet each child where they're at. They're all three different personalities, you know, and and that's another part of the challenge. Because you just want to sort of lay down this one law that doesn't work for you, you know, and that's you know, when you when you juggle in three different personalities or have them in multiple kids that definitely can be challenging.	0.0

Now New York is like London. This wasn't that New York, you know what I mean? So when you come out the club and you go around the corner to get into it the Wolves is on you so you kind of had to kick up dust so people who they knew who not to you know rock with it in that way, but you know that ain't nothing but a little adjustment.	1.0
