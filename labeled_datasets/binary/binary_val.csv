You know, what's interesting is like I didn't feel I felt sad for him because so let me take you through the so so that happened at 12:00 right when I'm 21 reconnected with my father and that's when I came into my sister's life. Then that dissipated now. I mean I've been in my sister's life ever since then but I'm saying him and I was relationship. I'm 25. I try to do it again doesn't work. Then when I was about to turn 30 at a long conversation with one of my aunts that inspired me to try to rekindle that didn't work and so through my life up to you know, when he passed away. I had tried to open this door, but through that experience. I learned that you know Every relationship has to be a dialogue and can't be a monologue. And for some reason when certain, you know, we would talk about certain things and when certain things would come about he would certain Poise a conversation will come about he would just close off he would just close off and so, you know, I told them, you know, I told them I forgave him. I told him, you know, it's all love and you know, I gave him those things and you know, I would tell him I'm saying, you know, they must be if we're both still here God must have a purpose for us to build something, you know, so so when he passed, you know, and I'm saying this just to be honest with you and I'd say this with no I'm not trying to be it was like hearing that someone passed, you know outside like when I leave here, you know, it was like a stranger because I didn't know and For me, I just felt more sad for him because it didn't have to be that way, you know, and he had other kids. He had one other son who he was in and out of his life. So but I was the first one I was the oldest and there was a point that like I did so let me tell you this other part like with my sister. I I got to a point where I was like I was willing to have been the guinea pig like I get it I was your first kid is all new to you volleyball. But when I saw that he repeated that pattern with my sister, that's when I lost a bit of respect. I come on like I would have much rather. That's when I had expectation. I thought at that point he would have been like yeah, I figured it out. Okay, you know also given but when he repeated that same pattern with her That's you know, that was a disappointment.	0.0

It's just about it's about until it's just about Gathering as much as you possibly can you're Under One Roof. You can't leave your sweet or else you get swarmed by crazy people in the lobby. And so you just sit up there and you talk about different scenarios with your fellow front office members and you You talk to other teams and see what they're doing you talk to agents to see what other teams are doing. So that's what this is. And and I also think I mean, it's crazy. I'll and I know fans this is this is a different situation like last year. I think fans grew tired of the kluber Bauer stuff because it just seemed like it was a different report every day and then nothing ever happened. This is different. This is the face of your franchise. This is a franchise shifting decision one way or the other. You're setting yourself up for the next decade one way or the other so I get it. But also like I landed yesterday there were a couple like vague reports and a specific report from someone who's probably never even been to an Indian's game and like everyone's panicking and saying I bet something's going to happen in the next five ten minutes or like we're getting close where there's smoke there's fire and it's like don't be surprised if this lingers I mean this is yeah. This is not the sort of thing that just gets hashed out in one. Dinger one phone call over an hour like this is this is a lot of back and forth between two smart front offices. And again, like even if the if the Dodgers are like will give you Lux and we'll give you may and you give us kluber and Lindor and the Indians are like, we really like this deal like this is this is definitely what we need to do. They still should go and talk to other teams and be like, can you top this like this is going to take a while and I think there are a lot of keep saying hurdles are off. Pickles but there's just a lot of things that you have to check off before you make a trade like this and I won't believe it until incarcerated.	1.0

Welcome to another episode of the packet a podcast your One Stop Shop for all news and Analysis from the green and gold. My name is Mike went along with me Tyler grigorik as always as we turn the corner from free agency. Now toward the draft. April is just about a week away are about one month away from the NFL draft course. That's where the Packers make most. Most of their bread and butter and Tyler you've been doing a lot of work with the draft coming up not just with the cheesehead draft guide but also with your Packer threshold and everything you've worked with so I guess tell us all what you've been working on as far as the draft goes over the past few months.	1.0
Totally. Yeah, and so what happens and it's interesting that you know, you all speak so much about like deprivation and I'm curious to hear the connection. But like when you when you go through that process of whether it's fasting or just restricting your calories in some way even if you don't think you're restricting your calories, but to your body like your body doesn't actually know if that's intentional that you're on a diet or you're trying out some new fasting Trend or if you're literally like experiencing food insecurity or a famine. So on the weekend as soon as you are around abundance with Food or as soon as you like loosen the reins on the tight grip of your eating habits, your body is also kicking up your Cravings your hunger hormones your metabolism to try to compensate for that missed caloric energy that you missed out on. So again, it's like it's not even Something That We're consciously doing but as soon as your body believes that you're that you have access to food again, it will send you into overdrive to try to make up for that loss.	0.0
It's like Jeff Davis is a genius and remember us all being Bamboozled for like a good while but him I have so many posts and like probably tweets that were like, I remember just like a while ago like a few months ago. I found like an old tweet of mine that was like Jeff wouldn't do steady eye. He knows that it's not going to work he is not Down he's a good writer. He would never do that. It's like the foolishness the ignore my God I had for this man.	1.0
You know that you haven't eaten and they're no good anymore. You might want to remove those. So that's one way of cleaning out the refrigerator, you know, sometimes we have good intentions and by a lot of produce and don't eat at all. And you know, I have to get rid of that.

It just didn't work. I think we were just like so stressed about time when you're home.

I'm not participating but chat representing my view, you know, like there's almost like this we're owner Ali connected and saying the same thing and it's like that's why I love like the streamer and shat relationship. I think it's so unique and funny because it's like we're all supposed to pretend like we have equal. We're on equal footing even though we're all watching One Loser on camera, you know, like it's funny like it should be a there should be some sort of relationship and the best dreamers that I see like xqc and everyone know how to use chat in that way.	1.0
I also think that their outfits look better than the runways. I know we'll talk about Runway. Yeah, but also I think they're the strongest MCS out of the bunch. So they did really well.

Instagram and all this is so huge with this generation and people get this little peek into your life. That's all the more reason to be so much more careful what you're doing where you're at and where you guys are together because you know, maybe we see you're at the house together sit on the couch and there's other people around but we don't know and so now we all think you guys just hang out at the house together because that's what's on your Instagram, you know, and so then it leads us to believe we don't know where you draw lines. We don't know where you draw boundaries. And so now you've given off the appearance of evil because you know, we don't know the full backstory and so I would just say to somebody who's dating be so conscious of the fact that first of all you're an example to people that are younger than you your example to people that are around you especially if you're in the church, especially if you're a leader and you're somebody that people look to you know, everything that you display of your life in social media, you know, people are looking at and they're analyzing whether you whether you think they are not they're doing it and they're looking to there. Really looking for you to set a standard. You know, when we when we go when we used to go on trips with our with our work and we were working a secular job people would always come up in make jokes about us, you know, not drinking alcohol and be like, hey you want a drink you want a drink and of course, you know, we don't drink never have and that's not something that we want at all. It's not even a temptation. But you know, there was there's one person in particular that would always be like, hey, you know have a drink have a drink and I think I think back to all those times and I'm like, you know What if we actually would be like, you know what since you've offered it like 25 times sure why not that person would be so disappointed because the thing is people actually like clear set boundaries. They actually want to see you as a Christian live differently than them as the world. And so that's why you find people people that are unsaved they'll see somebody that was like a minister at a bar and then they're like, hey, why is that guy here? You know the unsaved person thinks it's strange that you as a Christian are trying to Gov and be like the world so so it's even more so you should be looking at your life and evaluating. Okay, what are the things that I need to be doing? Especially as a young single person especially as a dating Christian person. I can't look like the dating person that goes on vacation with their with their they're very, you know, their boyfriend or girlfriend. That's not what you do as a dating Christian that's just doesn't work and it's the biggest thing that came across from you when I spoke to	0.0

Find the point when the bubble actually burst because we get we it's been blowing bigger and bigger and bigger and people might say well look it's working. Right the stock market is up. It was that we had a crisis in 2007 2008. The market is up interest rates are low, but they're still you know, this there's some very small move down you could make I'd argue that they were at a point where they're meaningless, but but it seems to have inverted. Cam has worked how much longer can this work for before it all goes wrong in your view. Is there can we look at history to find a way to predict how close we are to the end of this?	0.0
Yeah, you know, I'm actually looking to supplement either I linebacker or defensive line here. Now this just to be quite Frank. This is not a good year for inside linebackers specifically when you start looking at the Packers thresholds now their thresholds for linebackers are actually relatively strict. There's never many prospects that meet them. So I think when they see Layers that are close to the thresholds or even meet them they're jumping all over them and there's only a handful of guys that you're probably even looking at here a guy like drue tranquill from Notre Dame. He's on that. He's on the cusp of meeting all the thresholds. A guy from Catholic. I like Cameron Smith from USC. Bobbio correctly from Stanford, but I didn't hear you. Say Caitlyn Saunders. Is he still available the defensive lineman from Western, Illinois?	1.0
So This you're underwater for that long. And basically you're fighting for your life. And at some point you just kind of have to come to terms with it and peacefully accept that this is the end like that that's a long time. I assume it seemed like forever. However long it really took but is like can you even describe was it like almost like an out-of-body experience? Like when you finally accept death, you're like I'm here was there it was there any kind of weird?	1.0
Yeah you were I see on Denim and then yeah, I'm using right away like yeah, he had a baggy on the - yeah, because scenario was you know, we're in a parking lot of these people are just kind of passed out like there's no signs of accent or anything Todd see this. Sorry that guy he see right away is like are you thinking it's some sort of a OD course, there's three people in the car and none of them were responsive really and one of them may be in the back. Is still someone at the Atlantic and yeah right away. We open the doors. He said I'm putting on masks everything like that. And then he's got me looking for any drug paraphernalia and we have found some white powder in the front. The best board has treated it like that. So it was it was good to see that scenario worked in to do that that sort of event now go get you thinking about it.	1.0
Alright, so If you guys don't know already if you've watched any favorite TV shows like Simpsons family guy Futurama American Dad. I don't know if they really predicted anything. Yeah stuff like cartoons. Yeah older cartoons. Yeah, all these cartoons and all these shows have actually had an addiction to something that happened in the future a couple years after the show like that episode as are Simpsons they think the creator of it is a time traveler, which would make sense. He's predicted like 18 to 20 things. And hold like life work like doing it. One of the biggest ones was the Mitt Romney thing where he was trying to vote for Obama and it kept going it was the machine that kept voting for Mitt Romney. There's that one. They predicted 9/11 early so that it was that they are becoming president. Yeah, that one they predicted 16. No. Yes, 16 years. They had the exact same place. He was at like as it was happening all the other thing they predicted which was really interesting was the God particle. I don't know if you guys know that one, but they had like Homer Simpson was writing on a board and he had I guess it was really close to the exact equation that was used to Sorry for the actual God particle, and I don't know how I don't know about me. But you put that together that if it says that close to the God particle, you might have you might be thinking something. You know what I mean? Like it's not part of God Particle because I have no idea.	1.0
Because it won't work luck. Only last you so long. You can only hit you can only hit black on roulette for so long until you hit red right? Nice analogy, bro. Thanks, bro. I just went to Vegas last week. I was there you just need to be real know that you know, but I so it was cool though. After that. I and I started going to college I went to school at IU. I didn't move too far away. I owe you that Indiana University and we that was the Campus based on of Bloomington. They had a telecommunications program there. So when I was there, I guess I started in between going to college and high school, but I actually started working with the local photographer. He Is the best in Indiana he still is is Kevin Hudson Hudson photography. He's absolutely amazing, but he taught me a lot of really cool lighting techniques because I was the guy moving his lights around we were using old strobes and things like that and he's cool. Yeah. I think he had like he was using the 5D. I think the time Mark to you know, Mark to Angela. I still have a 5D Mark II. Honestly, it might be a Mark 1 now that I'm talking about it so so in I know he has the 3 and the 4 now, but at the time though, I mean he had the best camera. I would shoot little promo videos for him with my camera. He he really liked the video aspect because he was Leave at ography right and studio photography.	0.0
All right now and I'm so glad you mentioned that because this is something that not only we need to be doing with our students, but we need to be teaching to our students. That looking people in the eye and saying hello Yeah, and it's amazing to me how much that effect can have on someone and I'm probably overly do this. I probably had annoyed the heck out of people a big city because I do now that I've got the travel a lot more with my career in education the way it is now like I go to DC quite a bit I go to I was in New Orleans last week I go to some big cities, right? I make a point no matter where I'm at to to look at people and say hello, and I know that one. Our parents have told us like all the time don't talk to strangers. Don't talk to me. But why not? You know, I'm not saying go get in a conversation with someone and tell them everything about your life. But when you're walking past them on the street. Hello. Hi. How's it going? How are you? You know I say hi to every single random person I passed and I get some really dirty looks I get the shaking of the head. Like, why are you talking to me? But why not? You know, why not just say hello. I mean, it's a simple simple thing when you're walking through a Lobby of a hotel Or when you I don't know. I know it seems like it should go without saying right but the do it and I get that this is educated for reached out to you here and obviously we sincerely hope you're doing that your students every day. I know all you amazing educators are saying hello to your students when they come in every day. That's that should go without saying but teach that to them why not teach your students to start doing that around the building for starters, you know instead of don't tell them to go out and just talk to every stranger they meet but say hello to every single person that passes them in the hallway or or on the playground or at lunch or in the office or on the bus hallway, cause there's no talking in the hallway screwed.	1.0

But I mean, let's talk about the level of padding things like multiple people associated with Move I've gotten Petty with fans to a level. I don't think I've really used to I mean, I think the only thing that comes close is like Steven Universe, but like I heard that been in what kind of aren't it was a Steven Universe or Voltron Voltron Voltron where you know, there was a huge class between the Show creator people of people involved with the show and fandom and they actually kind of went back and forth with each other, but that was later. So like before Teen Wolf, I don't really remember that happening. Often enough for people to find out about it.	0.0
Yeah, I mean I wouldn't as same thing for me like at 12. That was when I first was told that I'd be worthless if I had sex before marriage and like you're saying identity wrapped in Christ. My identity was wrapped in my virginity that was definitely an aspect of it as well. Yeah, so like and then when I wasn't a virgin anymore and even when I was married, I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know what made me a good. Person anymore because that's all I was like, that's all I heard about. What a good person is a good person is a virgin. Well, yeah. Yeah, it's a disaster. So my Christian advice to anyone in countering any theist or someone that simply doesn't believe the same things or God forbid a Christian that actually believes different things than you two just like trust the Holy Spirit if you believe in God you Proclaim to like believe that Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit puffs. Faith that like everyone is on their own journey and everyone's going at their own rate.	0.0

So then we have to make choices like there's some good content that I won't watch. So at some point with all these Services coming in we're going to lose like the ability to even in participate or watch like great great shows so that much that's money lost. You know. Yeah that's sort of a and I choose and now for some reason I choose to consume less like easily accessible content over excellent content, you know, like instead of watching like Better Call Saul I'm going to instead opt for like a twitch stream because it's so accessible.	1.0

Way, I fully believe that what you do in dating like when you go too far you steal from Marriage from that and so you're stepping over boundaries that when you get into marriage, you're like, they'll be less of an enjoyment. So you have a and that's why you shouldn't date for too long. Like if you're 14, first of all, you shouldn't be dating. I don't think anyone under 18 needs to be dating. The purpose of dating is marriage. It's not to have a friend like the that's the purpose. It's like what is this person right for me? I think honestly, there are some 18 year olds who are like ready to be married. Read and there's different people I wasn't I mean I was 30 when I got married, but if you don't have life figured out, if you don't know what you're called to do, if you don't have a job if you're living at home, if you're not you don't have a course that you're on if you're like still playing video games for a few hours a day. You're not ready to be married. And therefore you should not be dating but choosing the right thing understanding the purpose. It's not companionship. It's not so your Instagram feed can be awesome. People can think you're popular like the purpose of dating is in that's another thing too because because of how	0.0

That was a long time ago. That was like back in November. That's early stages. So I've been in this process for quite some time quite a few months. So it is I'm not I am now ready. It is time for me to reveal this news to you and part of the reason why I wanted to do that and why I wanted to include my surrogacy process in this podcast is because of the feedback that I've gotten by family members and non family members. So I I wanted to shine some light into that part of my life to help people make the correct decisions and to help people understand what it's like to be on my side. I know that people see a lot of advertisement about making x amount of money to help and what not and I basically want to give you my side of the story and why I'm doing it.

It's always the conversation is always about what black fathers aren't doing right as opposed to this is how you manage, you know, being a black father and what that means.

So The thought came about because that at one point I can't even remember when I launched the bedroom packages, but if this was quiet and I needed to create another income stream because when you're not staging properties, you need to find that how you've got to pay your bills, right? So I thought these bedroom packages would be a really nice idea because I had clients that would say to me. Oh, I just want you. Come in and transform my bedroom and just do it. I'll pay you so I kept getting these little hints from people. So I thought I'll try and make it a reality and it's a really simple concept that you can purchase a bedroom accessory pack and instantly your bedroom is made over with beautiful art and cushions and lights and it was really well received and I then started working on living room accessory packs. Kind of a similar idea. We just add the artwork in the cushions and the lamps but it all is in a theme.	1.0
You would do this dude, you fucking house.	1.0
But anyway, so so you you guys are recent on on the the Bridwell card, correct?	1.0

What exactly if it's outside of the yeah, but we also beat them a few times in different polls and like knows Madness was everything there was no ship and to move that ever came close to being able to beat like it would be like it would be steric versus like studio and we would win and then like the studios would be like, okay new poll, here's stare and here's there and it would be like only like to study a fancy.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, it is nice to turn it off and listen to Nature sometimes. But I just love listening to music I listen to all the time. I listen to it. I walk to school to pick up my daughter. I listen to when I'm working. Listen to what I'm running its. Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
So I was glad to see the Dancing with the Stars was something that you were able to yeah, it really is do it was so great because thing was Derek story was my first tour ever and it was hard because it was three months long with the preparation and everything and that meant I had to move to California for just a little bit for the rehearsal period and being that we live in New York not to see him for three months was Only extremely difficult so he did come out and see me like time to time. But of course, it's not the same when you're living together know right away the moment I got Dirk's called to be on this tour Tasha said I don't care what you do. You're not even going to think about you're doing this tour. He's like it's not just for you. It's for us because we want the world to see way more basically ballroom dancing has been seen as all Glitz and glamour, you know, that's and rhinestones and which is great but great hands. Right and at the same time like even in our competitive career whenever we danced Ballroom, it was really more pedestrian type of Ballroom where you get up and you wear jeans and t-shirts and you make it sexy without all the rhinestones which we saw in World of Dance right season 2. Yes, exactly. And that's exactly what we wanted to deliver. So the fact that I was able to kind of go into Derek store and like really fresh out of the competition floor and just do what I love to do and just kind of Be as partner on tour, which was great at the same time. It was just so great for Pasha and his family. So it was it was definitely something I shouldn't have thought twice about but the only reason I did thought think twice about it was just because Pasha was in New York.	1.0
So you all really excited about that Owen other Sally so against today's on the bed you do. He's an absolute decline. Yeah. He's a big audience a-wing backwards. Midfielder but dropped started using him as a Centre back.	1.0
I've got talked about this last but I think it's actually it's a good segue since you mentioned the day or so and Tommy Boy situation. Now this new just came today, but the original story from a few weeks ago our boy Kanye West has been in a legal battle with Rockefeller and Emi who has been signed with since 2003 Kanye West with the Timothy to gain his ownership of his music and receive unpaid royalties, but now the news has come around that's mr. Kanye West has sold his soul and you know, I mentioned that he was with the Amana 2003 but his contract got extended in 2010, but according to this contract and I'm going to read what it says here and I can read the whole thing, but But verbatim it says at no time during the term. Will you seek to retire as a songwriter recording artist or producer or take any extended Hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing your musical career and the same basic manner issue in for sued such career to date. So what that means is that if Kanye loses his battle this man still can't retire like that's that's just wild this is wild. After all it is your trying to get ownership of your music Emi Rockefeller on it. You're trying to get unpaid royalties and they like well, okay no matter what happens. You can't retire bread according to this contract. So it's just another one of those situations where you're not reading fully what's going on or you are reading and you're just willingly signing over everything that you own and everything that you work for. These companies are shady man. And it just it sucks. I know that we made for The Kanye Kanye gun some wild stuff especially last year alone, but I don't want to hear this from anybody. I don't want to hear anybody trying to fight to get ownership of their music and then end up being a Slave at the end of the day because of some loophole or something that the artist did not look at before they actually signed a contract or signed the extension. So, how do you feel about this whole situation with Kanye?	0.0
So back in those times when I've ever been there's plenty of other times when I've woke up with eggs on my head and regret and I don't drink Tennessee Honey whiskey either but so many weird memories, but that one that one really, you know Takes the Cake that one seriously Takes the Cake if we don't acknowledge her she'll go back to like licking the Kelly's like being a dean. And yeah, she needs she's trying to company. Okay. So tell your story that was a great story. Um, so I we each have two stories. So yeah, I'll tell mine then you tell your next one and then I'll tell my next one. I'm going to start off with a college story. So I had a couple girlfriends my I think it was like my sophomore year of college and we I want to say it was like st. Patrick's Day or something like that. Maybe it wasn't I could be making that up but we all like got super dressed up like curled our hair like put a bunch of makeup on like how to hot outfit we frickin wore heels like we were doing the damn thing and one of my roommates from college we will call her. I don't know. We will call her Mary that way marriage a week Mary. That wasn't her name. But we're going to call her Mary. So Mary had a friend will call this friend Bethany. So Mary had a friend named Bethany and we saw a couple of my girlfriends and Mary who was my roommate we went to this party. Like it was like this big thing. And so I we got to this party and you're having a great time. You know, we were we were all drunk as fuck living our best life's I would do anything to go back to those days, but maybe not and so Mary's friend Bethany. Are we following along Mary Mary?	0.0

You got a macaque. Yeah real you got a parachute to come home with yes.	1.0
Okay? Let me yeah, okay, I can give you what one thing that I read recently. Okay, so many things that I like but as seen at the very beginning we talked about philosophy and sorry some of the servants rather suits but this is really great and it's accessible for everybody. So I have this I discovered this Austrian friends of mine this psychiatrist by the name of Victor, Frankl Viktor Frankl Man suit	1.0
Well, I actually consider myself an agnostic atheist. So basically agnosticism is, you know a claim about knowledge. Like I don't know if there's a God or not, but I'm an atheist because I don't currently believe in one. I don't I don't think that I don't know like I don't think there's a God I don't Necessarily see a lot of proof of a God, but I'm more open to that conversation of maybe because I know like when people start talking about science and I start talking about like the origins of the universe and all this stuff. Like that's very fascinating to me and it's not something that I have studied as much as I would like to um, but I never want to be like one of those people where I'm like, yeah, there's absolutely definitely not a God and I'll fight you like to Able to prove that it's like no like I don't have this like hidden agenda. Like I don't want there to not be a God on top of that my friend circle like since their identity was in Christ my identity to them became non-Christian like that is all I was to them or that's how it felt and I would be like introduced as like, oh, this is Nicole. She's a non-Christian. Like this is my reward. Yeah, like to their new like church friends and you know more extended people it was like this is my non-Christian friend like that will know that was my label and it was so like demeaning and I'm like literally that's all I am. That's all they see is the lack of belief in their God and then I've had some people stay like you're never going to know true Joy or true happiness or true fulfillment. You're never Have purpose and your life is like destined to be meaningless because you don't believe in our God and that's just like so mean to say and it like really breaks people down and I think that goes back to this idea of like if you break people down enough, they might come back to the belief system and it's like such a manipulative way of going about things for them.	1.0
So I was totally disconnected from being a household name because there was no social media, so I didn't know that you didn't know you were famous now, I know. I was famous like in New York, you know what I mean and you know certain places if I went to do promotion and it was it was a different world. So we didn't have that that instant connectivity. So I didn't know how famous if you want to you know, say like that and plus the type of person that I am. I'm more like laid back I had to depart to feign that I really had to you know, I'm from Brooklyn like it wasn't do staring at what they looking at and we got a whole different mindset and they might just want to autograph and it's like oh	0.0

Yeah. I think I think in the next season they get into high school. So they're either an eighth grade. They might even being seventh but then again there is Young and I guess that accounts for the fact that they seem a little less mature when they're reading the lines, but also the lives that they're given are clear. Lee written by adults for kids and they're not they just don't seem like things kids would say, I don't know. Yeah because like you look at a show like Andy Mac or something like it's very we're going to always be comparing. Yeah, but just like the you can tell like they actually like talk to children and like you understand kids at that time. So yeah, I agree with you.	0.0
Yeah. I mean like for instance I bought the $10 and I got a legendary. I got a legendary Banner. Oh my God poor blood Honda. She had like the snake the snake one. So I really like that one. So any time I'm black Honda I get to have that and it's really cool. And then the other one was the G7 Scout. I got the Gold Dragon one and so like that but like I don't know how much that feeling would be towards something that like I bought it on purpose like having that. I mean, I'll God I'm speaking right to the I'm speaking right to the British people who are trying to outlaw loot boxes, but that feeling when I got as a surprise was really nice because I didn't spend 18 effing dollars on its so having it this Nice little surprise while it boom orange. I'm like, oh, I like this, you know, yes and I have to admit that that was part of what made it nice if I had to spend $18 on a gold dragon.	1.0
this week on Chompers its In charge week, what's in charge week? Well, it's about all the ways that people are in charge of stuff. So to start we've got a quiz about who is and isn't in charge.

Everybody up just our I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot down a line real brief with it. Just all top because it's so many to name her like I can see like the I can talk on and off ever so high but I won't I was just like just be real brief just the ones I think of off top and then I'll just name a few that I feel like never get the credit. They deserve that I think is really good as well. But I'll start off you got to start off with the Fuji Quincy Jones like Quincy Jones. We talked about Quincy Jones When you talk about his Netflix, Joining, right mmm, but I like how you didn't even know that he produced no saying a lot of different stuff. Like when I was talk about the Austin Powers and it's my party and all that type of stuff. Like a lot of people didn't know about that. You know, a lot of people don't know about the Michael Jackson stuff. The Quincy Jones had his fingers in a lot of shit got though Quincy Jones our IP J. Dilla course, no saying probably my favorite of all time. Probably just the way he the way he laid laid his chops and stuff down was like some shit. Brilliance for like people still can't figure out how you did some of the city due to this day with that. Mpc2000 DJ Premier and other one 9th. Wonder who's my personal favorite right now Riza. Well, I think never gets the credit. He deserves, you know with the Wu-Tang dr. Dre, of course Timberland, if you're not if you're not aware of some of the shit that tamerlan did man like everything from Missy to live to Justin Timberlake North and Nelly Furtado like you name Timberland for someone who's the dude for real? And then I throw in Kanye now, I'll just I'll stop right there. It was a because it's just a lot of different people like I could like opt like people that don't people don't check for as much I believe that Big crib is a dope producer that people don't talk about nothing crisis who's with the soul council with 9th Wonder and I'm he don't get talked about he got some hot shit. It a lot of different people man. Not that's another one that I checked for. What about Hindus to do them? Gz beats and trap beats shorty red Shawty red on the trail. He used to do some hot shit man. Like Todo Jones was hot man. That's a lot of people Mannie Fresh. He was another one I can think of this is a lot of people mantid. You could just go on for hours talking about producer.	1.0

Like I always tell people, you know, when you hold that syringe back up, you can see the are in just slowly push the plunger of the syringe up until that are is gone. You don't need to see in the movie spurting out of the syringe because we're not wasting our naloxone, you know, just until that are is out and if there is still Mariner totally fine. It's not gonna do anything to you. It's like said it's not like the movies.	1.0
That's so interesting because from my end. I'm sitting in the control room and I couldn't tell what James was feeling. Because he wasn't saying much and so when he all of the sudden says I want to put in a hundred fifty K and I want to lead the round. I was completely stunned like what did that feel like in that moment?	1.0
three bad jokes Which one circular do this way I take nice and easy chips. That's number one for me right now. I didn't see that as a joke. I thought that was just part of the story. I saw that as a joke, but I see you as a joke from a fucking hat us and I don't know why but we were fucking running from side to side just a bunch of fucking kids in the line like running as fast as we could and we would just smack the fuck out of the wall and No, it was it wasn't a game. We're just running. I think we must have been like annoying and they could tell we had a lot of energy.	0.0
I think we're Jillian's getting out is where is the defensibility here? I've been long time. Right? So we see Squarespace. We see all the platforms Magento Shopify etcetera and we're kind of thinking are they gonna do this? And one of the answers could be you have some you have all these data right? And so is there some sort of Data Network effect.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited about that. I think that's I mean just that itself and our lighting perspective. It's got a very dry feel. It's you know, got a very stranger things feel. Yeah. I'm just excited for it.	1.0
Right? So again, like I told you earlier when I first came around went to work for Dawn Kish and and sure if anybody anybody knows anything about bucking bulls and those who've gone to issues and knows what he did for a lot of years and and So I worked around that outfit for a long time and you know, I learned a lot about bulls. I think I learned a lot about bubbles in it and with around a lot of bowls and a lot of cows and lot of All That Jazz. And there was a time when like in the late 90s when I first went around there and early 2000s when if you wanted really good Bulls you need to raise them. I mean, I think everybody would I think you'd be naive to say that in that period of time you needed to raise the goal is to get the kind you wanted that were that were beyond what everybody else had but as we all know through the last 15 years, it's changed, you know, the You know heck there's there's people showing up to those a BBI events that nobody's ever heard of that just flush the cow and put it with this did that and have a mother and had a really good bull, you know, I mean II am not and when I say really good, but I'm not talking about bushwhacker. I'm just saying they have both it turned back in the gate bucket or you know, 22-point Bull and it's somebody that's not really a bull person. They've just bred that way and and and not to try and get and I don't Mean it like this discredit people like they don't know what they're doing. I'm not saying that what I'm saying is it would be no different than me and going and Bryant buying a cutting horse out of highbrow cat and some fancy mayor, you know, I the Bloods there it's in them. So if you know, if you don't as long as you don't mess him up, you know, the Bulls are available and so forth for through just the supply and demand of the rodeo the kind of bulls we Rodeo with week, you know, you guys all know that we don't need both like, you know Long John rodeo with or frozen or whatever, you know, you don't need those but we just need you know, you just need good Bulls to turn back and guy can be 85 or better on and and and so for us what works when my wife Haley and I started Bridwell pro rodeo, you know and and here a couple of years ago. We just found for us. It was more cost effective just to buy the boats, you know with with raising them and that I just don't have the feed for him don't have enough country out here in California Every Little Bit of Country. I get I have to put the horses on because I can't afford to buy the high-end horses, but I can I can I can buy, you know, I have to raise those but I could I can match around and they're really good Bulls, you know, just for free.	1.0
But yeah, so so here's my idea is right. Okay, I love them through and entertainment like movies TV shows talk about what's going on in that range of things. Straight talking about like what movies are doing good movies aren't doing good that kind of thing. And then my second idea is music. Like the music realm I guess we could get into music to an extant has that is definitely the other things going on in the wrap in the rap culture right now, like not even just rap.	1.0
Yeah, that's a great point. And one of the things we've noticed is it's been uh, it's been small single digits over the past in 15 plus years and we're projecting it to climb to almost a third of the construction starts in terms of dollars spent and that's a that is a huge shift in the way in which projects are built and it's In amount of large projects and the challenges they're becoming is proliferation of these large projects and the experience on them is largely bad from a cost standpoint from a schedule standpoint. We are seeing as I mentioned this at the Kirk conference from our point of view and working with contractors. We're seeing lots of what I will call voluntary exits from a space. So contractors that are saying we've gotten into these large projects we've had bad. Experiences we've lost a ton of money in the case of some public companies. We've lost a lot of Share value and we are strategically pivoting out of that market and we are going to go find work elsewhere. Well what other contractors participate in the reproductive and then there are you know, sort of what I've referred to as the involuntary exits is we have seen a lot of in the past 24 months is contractor bankruptcies, even for some of the largest companies in our industry that go belly-up as a result of being involved. These big projects that get sideways and they can they can take down even even a really large contractor.	1.0
So every once in a while, I'll be like give me that fucking thing and I go order isn't he?	1.0
I actually Michelle's not I'm finding myself saying this more this season. I don't know why but I actually kind of agree with her because I felt like it was a very it was kind of like let's create a theme that can be anything. So we don't have to be as specific we can kind of do this and we can kind of do that we can kind of do this. So, I think that was kind of her point and I did kind of agree with that because it was it was like there was an alien, baby. Baby that you could touch but then there were moons and stuff. And then there I don't know. It did seem a little it didn't seem as cohesive as the hive which I know we will get into and I have notes about it, but I liked it and I agree. I think they were hosting wise I thought they did a good job.	1.0
It was so bad and I was just being like so just oh my God, I was literally being the worst human being so tell everyone I would do it was literally like talk about like some salt to the Earth like real awesome.	0.0
Yeah, and I definitely appreciate it shout.	1.0
Yeah, they're they're taking their Fortnight, you know connoisseurs and trying to bring it over here. Like now that stuff doesn't fly all the time. It doesn't come go one to one all the time, you know, and I mean, I think the only thing is like, yeah, you can't really slide as as good but your actual like speed Really isn't affected all and so yeah, I think maybe it is just a mind thing. So we just opened up the floodgates now, it's just going to be like everybody's going there taking vacations. We're good. We ruined it speaking of ruining it number four is the pit. The I think my favorite thing about the pit is nine times out of time then again, if I drop at the pit, my next stop will always be the slums because because of that Redeploy their it is always really good. And I mean no matter where the ring is. The redeploy will get you close enough where you can kind of take your time. So you can you can go all over the pit. You can go all over the slums get to that Secrets place that we were talking about and still have enough time like okay, I better go ahead and hit that redeploy. And then you start going towards, you know, like the what's that bunker called like to the West I mean, it's just like this big kind of Hangs over the mountain kind of hangs over the Cascades and stuff. I don't know what it's I don't know if that's named technically. So it's kind of like what it's just a little bit south of artillery, right exactly that so you can kind of start heading that way you won't make it because there's a little Bridge area but even that bridge area has some decent loot. I mean, I don't think you'll have high tier loot but it is a there's a good little stop there along the way and then even if the circles bearing down on you the the Outer Circle will most likely be somewhere around like Cascades. You know that first or that round to Circle usually will be right around Cascades no matter where it ends up on the on the map so you can make it there. Absolutely. No problem.	1.0

You've got to figure out what it is that actually makes you feel alive. And if you understand that the game that you're playing is actually a game of brain chemistry and that nothing else matters. There's no objective truth. There's no one path to Glory. There's no one life for you to live. There's only the subjective truth that thing inside you that gut instinct that voice that Whispers to you. You've got to learn to trust that you've got to learn to trust it by building it up. You've got to The Trusted by taking actions and gut checking yourself and asking is that me is that who I want to be or is that somebody else cultural voice my parents my lover whatever trying to speak through me and his Harley Davidson said when writing a story of your life, don't let anyone else hold the pen. So right now ask yourself. He's writing your story. Is it you are you really listening to the voice in your head? Are you looking at and listening? Living by the things that give you the chills or are you trying to live a life that somebody else wants for you? And remember when you think about that question what William James said act as if what you do matters because it does even if for nobody else every step you take every thought that you were allowed to permeate your mind everything you obsess about your dreams the things that you want the hopes that you spend your time. I'm with they matter to you because they tell you who you are.	1.0

Maybe I can compete next weekend or something that you know, like why you're staying with your Technique you want to make sure that you're ready ready for anything and maybe I don't want to compete necessarily but I definitely want to continue doing shows with Basha because I do love dancing with him and retiring means I don't get to dance with him anymore, you know, so I don't want to think of it like that and I want to think of it just I'm trying something new. I'm still the same dancer. I just have a new audience. That's it. You know, I don't want to finish it.	1.0

Clean that tray underneath kind of my trick if I have not been good about cleaning my burner trays and they've gotten discolored.

I realized that people wanted their In properties furnished and so I had to then go and every job I got where I needed Furniture. I would just buy for that house and it has just accumulated over time, but I don't have any higher options. I think Canberra is probably the closest and that's 3 hours away.

Yeah hundred eighty eight and my we always dive with bodies when possible because it's a dangerous business and it's nice to have someone there to back you up, but my body couldn't clear his is and so I had to go down by myself. And this is just outside the heads of Sydney Harbour and this is a great white shark highway is tiger sharks as bullshit. And so I have to sit at my what we call a wet.

We're not going to be happy Indians fans Indians for an office to I would venture to say that that's probably the takeaway that they have if they want to go draft day. They put a note in their pocket and it says Gavin Lux or nothing walk away and so I I have a certain faith in their ability in these negotiations to be able to walk away because we've seen in the past they They stick to their guns on this this sort of thing. They very rarely will meet you too far in the middle. They'll make trades. They think are fair and I don't know if they're necessarily trying to go out there and and Rob anybody but they have in their mind what they think is fair value in return for their guys. And if you're not willing to match it unless it's a situation where they're losing the player at the end of the year or the player doesn't really factor into their plans. They're prepared to just say no. Thanks and keeping Francisco. Lindor is one hell of a Secondary prize and I could argue is probably the first prize but as you've laid out before you've written we've discussed in this podcast the last week. If you do hold on to them, then you better you better make that worth it. You need to make that move count for something because once once you pass this winner and you the season starts to me, it's like a car driving on a brand new car driving off the lot the minute it does that the value has declined a bunch and lens or anything. Your cars, no kidding the luck. I have and Lindor is a I mean you're already starting with the value that is through the roof. So even if you're treating him for one year, you would give back something useful, but you're not going to get back. Somebody's top prospect like Gavin Lux, that's not happening. If you trade him. I think if you go through the end of this offseason and you hold on to him you can wave goodbye to anyone getting anyone close to that level.	0.0

So I guess there is a good part to the story. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm just looking at my notes and I had a couple different stories and I just looked at this and there was a time where I fell asleep in one of my best friend's driveways in high school. But other than that that was a whole other story, but we're not going to get into that. But yeah, so I'm like crying to this cop and they like clearly tell that I am struggling and so as I know from this point is that I have a drinking ticket and when you go to drinking ticket, I think you need to Like 30 days until they call you because you need to like go to these classes so you can like you like path I be in a yes at 16 years old. No, but listen to what happened, I actually got pretty lucky. So they're supposed to call within 30 days. And if they don't call you, then you're like off the hook. They like forget about you. So that's what happens me. But if they did call me I would have had to do all these classes. I would have had to pay like a huge fine, but they never called me. Oh my god. So let's assume I'm fine. There's bigger and better things to conquer. I know I think I like Even Lee was like people doing heroin. Oh, yeah, and I was just like drunk off of two bears at 16. Like I was fine. Yeah. I feel like in high school like drunkenness was very different than drunkenness in college. Like I got hammered and lost my toenail and didn't remember. Yeah, but for me a school without it happen, I would have seemed very much remembered. Yo, I don't know my high school was pretty like it's funny because I got into a relationship with Cody the my freshman year of College so like I'm not trying to saying this like lame in college because I wasn't like I still want out and shit but in high school like I think like I don't know our fucking high school was pretty wild like I had some of my wildest times in high school, but also in college, so I think it's like pretty definitely I would say training College. Yeah. No, I think I hit it early in high school for sure, but I do think like equally I've had just this crazy times in college then I didn't High School. I had to get my eggs for me in high school was like a thing thing. Like I was smoked I was so against weed for the long. I don't think I had like my first oh my God, my first so bad like blonde or whatever J anything until Earth smoked out of a bowl. So I was in like 11th grade I used to but I got drunk guy in like seventh grade. So I used to go to my car on my lunch break when I was in high school and literally roll a joint and walk in.

Like I still have my boys on the Block and he's just like, you know go to performing arts and I was just quiet with my wall and then you know, I had my boy Boys that I grew up with that we went we all went to the same High School my boy mom and my boy Mitch so we shared that thing and and I mean it for me it happened pretty quickly. Exactly. Yeah. I got out of high school a book juice and that's when he was like, oh like you really like trying to do his acting thing and I was like, yeah, but um, you know, I've been I've been blessed ever since. So how did you book juice juice was what they call a cattle call. So I so I you know, Got out of school and I was one of those and take a year off get a job kind of figure out, you know, I didn't I didn't know if I want to go straight to college one of my boys went to how and I was just like I'm gonna kick it around in the city audition heard about this audition went and it was like, I don't know how it seemed like it was like a thousand people there go in read they called me back read again. It was like every call back. It was a smaller group and it was a lot of chi don't remember how many callbacks but I wouldn't be surprised if he was something like 15 called like something out there and then there was like there was like eight of us that they were kind of like trying to put will you to read this role and you read that role and then they had a dinner and I remember my manager at the time she was like, you know, they really hot on this guy 2-pack 2-pack shocker and I was like what you just like whatever you do try to sit next to that guy because they really love love that. And of course as it would play out we sat on opposite ends of the table, you know what I mean, but after we had this dinner and everybody just vibed out and about couple days later. I got a call from Ernest Dickerson. He said hey man got some good news. Looks like you got the part and I was like really and was like it. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life.	1.0

I'm going to just take a step back and be like, I think you've been off more than you can chew and I think you're going to fail. Well, I appreciate my husband telling me like, I don't think this is a good idea then it was like he put the anxiety in my head of like, whoa, I think you're going to fail so like it was yeah, I'm setting myself up to fail, but I'm already being I'm already failing. So yeah, it was like, I think I'm not going to that. So anyway yesterday girls like Did you start at South both 75? I'm like no. No, didn't you enjoy it? She's like, okay. Just checking. I was just like and then she felt bad because like she thought I was like, right I was like no it's not a big deal. I was just it was it was like a like a gut decision that decision in the moment and I'm like, but that like for me and my lifestyle that I don't think that's a good fit, right? Yeah. I mean for me it's my goal is to get up and to go to the gym every day and feel good about you know, if I wake up and I don't feel right or like my Foot doesn't feel right. Like I don't go like I want to I do it feels good for me that day or if I need a rest day. It's great. And then yeah, um, that's what I do on that kind of a thing. Yes words are hard today.

So the other day, I'm at Sacramento muhittin hip and kind of making shoot forward and had a little bit of a different day that bull usually right there to the right. You like he'll go like a round or two right there to the right in the gate and then he'll jump forward and go back a left generally, but the other day, like I said, he hit he hit his hip and made him shoot forward and then he kind of had a kind of a I don't know. I didn't love these is move before I turn back. But once you turn back then he was fine. But yeah that hit so that will Omaha. I like him. He's a good boy, but he came from a friend of ours up in Oregon a guy named Rusty Gorham raised that boy. So the in their sure proud of them Rusty and Lisa are real proud of that bull. So that's cool. Cool for that deal back here. $3,500 will 10 Bingham was like 93 on them at Kennewick or something. Wasn't he? Right? Yeah. Yeah at Puyallup at the yeah. Yeah, and then his brother Tyler at Spring Road. The only time that Bulls been rode the last couple of years. Other than that the PBR deal, but Tyler Kimball throat. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Hi, you know good good good boy, the 93 I think was a stretch that was quite a bit of points. But but but he's a good-good bull and in back to our point is for for what works for our business and and I'm not saying that works for everybody. But for what we're doing it, it works better for us just to buy the both, you know, so I can see the guys that raise them like the pages I watched. They're Bulls at Sacramento. Watch what they do on the sales. And if not and how they do their their their business and I can see why they do what they do. It works. They block like hell and they sell it for lots of money. So they're doing they do you know what works for them? That's good for exactly. What so what about to you can kind of answer this in the two-part question but like us fraternity guys and stuff what kind of segregate our bulls and stuff and then I take it rodeoing, you know, it's um rodeos may have ample amounts of pain some may not Are they are they just in general population like at your house? And then how many how many trips a year roughly. We you put on a bull? Well, the first the first part of your question is is you nailed it. There's there's a lot there's rodeos have the facility that to split them up pretty good. But then there's a lot of a lot of rodeos at don't have that, you know the kind of facilities. You need to split them up a whole bunch. I'll tell you how I try and make them live. And and you guys being bull guide, you know that there's sometimes you just can't make mixes. There's some mixes that just don't work. They just don't like each other. We know we all know that kind of force them through it and get them to get along but for us how I try and do it as I pay them how they fit on a truck. So in a cattle pot sets of 6 is I got using I got a couple sets of fours or like a set of for a set of three got to be the nose and the back step and then sets Six is on the top, you know the top and the bottom decks. So and then that also fit for the pins that we have in our house, you know, we have pins that are about all half acre lots maybe from half an acre to maybe one acre lot and and that's plenty of room for them.	1.0

I can't fix any of this no matter what you do and I think that's where anxiety gets tricky for people like us it's because it's like you can't fix it. Like when your dad was going through that there's there's nothing you can do and feeling powerless hmm to somebody like us who is very Very successful at fixing things.

So I was and I got in I was like girl didn't I was like, I'm sorry, so she standing out there and I was like, I'll call you an Uber. I had it connected to my Dad's credit card at the time and I was like, I'll call you an Uber and she was like, I don't want an Uber I want to get in and I said well, I don't really know there's nothing I can do so, I don't know how long she stood. Out there, but I went in. It was the year of being a selfless bit like selfish bitch. I just wanted to get him on all you did when you weren't 21. All you wanted to do is get in like you're gonna leave your friends, but it's like hard to even think. I mean, I'm only 20 years but it's so hard to think about when I wasn't 21. Yay. I like don't because you literally had to like fight to get into places or even like pay them. I give them like throw my like, I remember Haley like let me use her. I think it was Haley. Yeah someone let me use their ID one time. Thank God it's it's stressful. Yeah, you got any of like makes it more fun accomplish this massive feat. So like I'm not turning around. Also, I was wasted so like sorry, but then I see a couple of friends from home. I know my friend won't mind if I shut like shout him out his friend. His name is Devon. He he came in he visited he's a Ellie stop eating the bed. All right. We met we need to sell your bed. Yeah, we need to do a lot of things. We need to train her Ellie. Don't lay on the phone.

Yeah United and so, you know, I was just so happy to see him. I was so happy to be with my friends. I was so excited. And I got completely wasted like Beyond life my boyfriend at the time went to the bathroom. He was gone for maybe three minutes. Like I don't really know he could have been gone longer and I just thought he like I don't know what happened. I thought he was gone for hours. He wasn't though and he was like Andrea. I literally just went to the bathroom. It's time to go home. It was like 1:30 in the morning Nicki Minaj was playing. People were twerking. It was just getting wild and people weren't working. I know and I never I never learned how to twerk. Like I'm either I like tried, but which is Barren because I've been like a dancer and cheerleader. I should know how to do that. But I should have Kaylee come on in like give an example or like give up a step by side Kaylee green. She teaches teachers teach you how to twerk. I need that I've other friends I can talk to and I just like can't like, you know what that's actually a lie. I use when twerking was for a school. I definitely get to work and now I'd like got old and I can't anymore. I'm just if I break a hip same so hey, I'll I'll finish my story so real quickly. So Taylor can get onto hers, but we leave we're in an Uber I of course get the spins. I don't really remember why but I was like, I'm gonna fucking puke and so then we get out of the car.

Evenly when I start this with my teams. They all look at me as if I am treating them like children around the second or third week. They get more excited and their answers get weirder as they become more comfortable with everyone. This reinforcement bonds them all and gives them things to talk about A Works towards my value of the team getting along. It's weird. How much to girls can Bond over both loving turquoise discipline. You've already created rules and discuss them both with your players as well as their families. Everyone is on the same page. Let's say you have some pretty basic rules like no kicking the ball. No swearing no side conversations during Huddle's Etc. So what happens when one of your girls gasp breaks one of these rules, this is a major decision. You need to make before the season. Ins because the first time it happens it sets a precedent. Are you going to let it slide? Will you give out warning after warning yet do nothing about it in the end or will you stop everything and send your players to the service line and make them run until you think you get the point across drop in the middle of a match and do push-ups as former players. We probably all experienced differing disciplinary Styles coming from our coaches maybe even differences from the same coach depending on their mood the head coach may have been extremely strict while the assistant was. Mainly there to encourage the girls on your team while you don't come into your first season wondering what sort of punishment your team will serve for various offenses. It is something you need to decide on make sure your other coaches are on the same page. Not sure where to start think about this. The whole point of discipline is to make your girl stop some sort of behavior. Usually one. They know they shouldn't do but decide to engage in any way. The best punishment is one that they do not want and will therefore try to avoid some rules one, bro. Are more detrimental to the team than others kick a ball out of the way when peppering not good, but likely just a reflex give them a warning Buddha ball across the gym after missing a dig. She's sitting out no questions asked which leads me to my next point my personal approach to rule-breaking is this you break a rule you sit out everyone knows the rules and I don't have the time or patience to give warnings in very rare circumstances. I'll give a warning but because my team's know that I'm a no-nonsense coach when it comes to breaking the rules warnings are rarely necessary while different age groups will have different kinds of rule-breaking you need to decide on punishments which are consistent with your temperament and coaching style. I don't personally agree with punishments such as running lines push-ups laps. What have you this gives those activities a negative connotation and I want my girls to want to do those things to be in better shape. I do make one exception to running as discipline simply because a former coach of mine used it and I think it's genius Swearing was not allowed on the team. And if someone decided they were going to cuss the entire team will get mad at them. But why why would a player be mad at another player for breaking a rule depending on the number of letters in the word of choice? That is how many laps the team had to run but wait, it gets better the person who swore would stand in the middle of the court or jam and count the number of laps out loud for the rest of the team. My old coach used pure pressure against us to curb our attitudes I can Practically guarantee that if you implement this rule with your team swearing will be minimal whatever disciplinary policies you decide on make sure you stay consistent in your enforcement of the rules. Just because one of the girls who has never once gotten in trouble is having a side conversation during a huddle do not let it go fairness is something girls are very sensitive to particularly when they feel it is going against them giving up the perception of playing favorites can be just as damaging to their trust in you as if you are actually playing favorites. Practice design one of the topics I'm most passionate about when it comes to volleyball is practice design organizing skill practice and game like drills in a way that builds up and culminates in proper skill execution is vital to running a successful practice. It is crucial that you spend more than just a few minutes coming up with practice until you are a seasoned coach and even then you'll probably spend more time tweaking drills to make practice just right. So let's talk about practice design what I mean by practice design is the a flow of your practices from one major category of skill work or Play Games Etc on to the next to begin. You always need to warm up. This should take roughly 10 minutes for each practice to make sure your girls have warmed up their muscles properly the rest of how you spend your time will vary depending on how long your practices are with younger players practicing for shorter amounts of time usually and can be broken up as follows Dynamic stretching stretches that make your players move warm-up game a game. That gets the players moving and playing volleyball but uses them into play there should not include scrimmaging and should limit full serves or attacking right away games with a lot of movement are ideal skill demonstration and concept introduction explain a new skill or concept for this example. I'll use jousting Jousting is one two players on opposing chords go up to direct a ball that is tight to the net and could end up on either side. This may be too advanced for younger teams, but is a good skill to practice. Of 12 and under or middle school volleyball explanation should take no longer than five minutes unless it is very complex skill or concept specific drill. Now you run a drill which focuses on the new skill or Concept in our case jousting and sure you are running a drill which is slow down enough to focus on good technique, but quick enough to get a lot of touches on the ball and keep their attention game like activity which incorporates skill or concept similar to the warm-up game. We're not getting into full-on scrimmage. Out here. We just want to put the girls in a game situation in which has everyone practicing jousting as if it were happening in the game playing a short Court game where players can only tip will help the jousting situation arise more often old / familiar skill demonstration. Since Jousting is not typically one of the first skills you cover you are probably a few weeks or a month into your season by the time this comes up your team should be familiar with their defensive positions by now so you can review defense at this time. Sighs tip coverage as this is related to jousting scrimmage, which incorporates both skills and or concepts now is the time you get to test out how well your players have grasped the new information you have given them by running a full scrimmage. You are allowing your players to get in the habit of implementing their new skills in a way that would naturally occur in a game. Not one that is forced or predictable cool down. Your players have probably put a lot of effort into the last 15 to 20 minutes of practice and need to ease into their normal state. Cooldowns do not need to take very long but should not be skipped. Also, it's very important to incorporate water breaks for the team. If someone is thirsty during a drill that you should also allow them to get water right away schedule these in but make sure your players know that they can get water at any time. This is a safety issue. This does not by any means have to be followed religiously at every practice. However, if you are struggling to create a schedule for your practice in this might be a great place to start some nights, you may also have skills, which do not easily work. Whether using this framework, for example, you need to work on serving and setting it can be hard to make these two skills. Mesh.	1.0

Ring well, it's very exciting. And I guess it's something that I was a little bit naive probably being in Brisbane in the capital city. We had plenty of options when we started for hiring Furniture. So that that wasn't a limitation, you know, it was our real limitation was how much what you know, what happened we quickly could we build relationships with agents how quickly could we actually win some work and whatever work we were able to win it was either going to be constrained by you know, how many employees we had or how you know how we're going to actually fulfill. The orders whereas now I've met more people from Regional centers or rural sort of places something that didn't even cross.

This is a small-town Southern Indiana and this guy was teaching me all the stuff that he had learned for 20 years. So I'm taking this and I'm trying to implement this as much as I can on set while with him, but at the same time I'm in a telecommunications program at IU and I'm not I don't feel like I'm learning. Earning anything right now and taking it's a university. So I'm taking these hard math classes finite math and you'll later once I got going in into college kind of my Junior and Senior year. That's when the fun classes started to pick up. So we had like production classes script writing classes script writing like I have kind of a tiff with because my screenwriting teacher unlike yours was actually really rude and yeah, it's a bummer so I kind of have this like little itch, you know with with screenwriting but I'm still working on it.	0.0
Exactly. So, yeah, I don't know how they would be able to incorporate like all the wall running and just and the island itself there certain areas that aren't made for all of that running.

Section 8 and ventilate these people because when they're coming up there's a very misconception that people are hammering with the locks on and they come up swing and they're just fighting. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they're probably fighting but they're hypoxic. They're you know, they're not thinking straight some of them. Yes, they come up you can kick them in withdrawals. If you give too much of a dough. So we generally start with point four point eight than one milligram, etc. Etc. But yeah, we don't like to hammer him right away with one two milligrams immediately because you can cook them. Into withdrawals. There's a very small percentage of people that could present with like a flash pulmonary edema, but the bacon is with those withdrawals. So then yeah, you won one of their going to feel gross from the barf, you know, then could have a whole other vast problems going to go into a seizure.

Yeah. Yeah, and there's been and so I think when you think about particularly in this audience, the construction users Roundtable, which is comprised of a lot of industrial owners. All side says something they're pretty familiar with and it's really their conversations are how do we continue to push the envelope? How do we do more of it? And how do we get the rest of the industry on board namely contractors and I think - real space is an area where owners have really been leaders and that regard because the incentives are there two things off site or as maybe you look at the commercial side of the industry where commercial owners have kind of said well contractors can go figure it out. And if you can deliver a building faster or cheaper through off-site construction, we'd be interested in contractors go. Okay, great. We're not Apple or Google and we'll have billions of dollars worth of R&D to go figure this out come up with a new mouse trap. So it's innovation in manufacturing and off-site construction is sort of limped along this some extent and the and the commercial space because there's been a lack of funding or interest or incentives on either contractors around or side on the big stuff.	1.0
Yeah, exactly. So who was engaged so I James I mean the whole time James got it. He got it. It was like like I like I was speaking to his soul and then I also felt like Jillian got it, but Jillian was Gillian was also incredibly, you know, she's Savvy as hell and so I mean like she is incredibly Savvy and so like A person like that can like you know, you think that they may have it but you're not sure until they say yes, you know and the other folks I could tell were like they're asking really good questions. So I think they were trying to get there but for whatever reason they couldn't respect, you know, but generally speaking, you know, I could tell that Jillian and James got it.	1.0

The beginning of the season has a lot of formalities which need to take place including meeting with the families of your team and setting expectations establishing team rules ordering uniforms Mr. On the bright side. You actually get to start practice which is why you are drawn to coaching in the first place right meeting the parents meeting. The parents can be an intimidating situation unless you are from a small town where everyone knows Is everyone you'll be going into this meeting with no idea what personalities you'll encounter from. The get-go. Everyone will be extremely friendly. Most of them will be just as excited. As you are about the upcoming season will be eager to hear your plans for the team. However, this doesn't mean you can go into the meeting totally relaxed. And without preparation families will have questions for you. And the ones who will ask you questions are the ones who are not concerned with sugar coating their enquiries. This is why you try to address many of these Topics in a welcome speech / presentation. So you give off the vibe of being prepared and that you are fully capable of leading their daughters. Here are some examples of the questions. You might be asked at your first meeting of the year.	1.0
Discuss anything other than running we do you mean running is a big topic of conversation and I'm sorry, we do believe it or not do other things and have all that interested, you know for sure running is a passion for both of us and we do talk about a garage sale.

Well not quite every weekend. But yeah, I'm not a fan of taking time off. I just do as I said things. The fall off when I do that, but I did tell her we're in my life in February this year. I did the I do that with Carl and I did the Brisbane Valley real Colonel Marlowe this year, which I did last year and last year and I actually collapsed a few hundred meters from the finish it my body went into shock, but I've made it I made it to the end with 20 minutes to spare. So I made it I think. 29 hours 40 minutes and this year I finished third third be mailing or just over 21 hours. So I learned a lot from that from last year. I was going to climb so high this year, but it got cancelled. So I did my own bun a high of 50 around being on the same day.

What do you mean? It's not a studio? It doesn't look like a studio film space, you know, like okay, so, you know how like the difference between like for example the set at Rico's and then watching episode of like and emac like the the set is different.

Yeah, and if you guys have the time Ross juggling did a fantastic study put together a Packers big bored and he did it pretty much based off the RS for the most part. It's a great read go check it out. And then she said TV, but essentially the relative athletic scores just me. They are comparing athletes for the last 30 or so years. There's a specific year that this dates back to kentley Plaid on Twitter at math bomb to the fantastic fantastic job of putting all this data together and he does it I believe for free. I don't think he gets any money for it, but it's basically a formula that he's arrived and a model and he just puts these numbers out. And what it does is it Compares Compares players relative to other players of their position using their size the height their weight, they're all their testing scores and just kind of puts out what percentile athlete they are in comparison to the rest of the players that were at that position for the last x amount of years. So every single year, it gets more it gets stronger and better indicator of what type of athlete that you're dealing with. With and it's just it's such a great tool and and we're blessed to live in the 21st century.	1.0

You're listening to clean with me the podcast about cleaning to listen to while you clean.	1.0
That doesn't belong for example the other day there was a toy a up there. There are certain things that go up there like a plant framed pictures a key basket, but there's other things that shouldn't you know, glasses there certain things that I allow up there and then certain things that just don't belong up there. So just remove any clutter from your living areas clear off the surfaces and the floors and then of course lastly you're going to want to sweep or vacuum the floors and there. And that's probably going to take the most of your time but it also probably causes the most impact as far as how your house looks having clean floors in your living areas, whether they're vacuumed or swept and mopped can make a huge difference in the appearance of your home. It'll definitely give you that bang for your buck people will be able to tell that you've cleaned, you know vacuuming and dusting is a big thing. So, Most of your time might be on vacuuming or picking up the floors. Most of your time might be spent on that. But since I can talk faster than you can clean. I'll give you some ideas of bonus chores in those areas and perhaps it's a day that you don't need to sweep or vacuum. Maybe your floors already look good some things that you can do are additional dusting. Maybe you need a desk some knickknacks a bookcase a piano. Maybe you have a window to wash - or you know something really occasional like dusting the baseboards. I've talked about this before but an easy way to dust your baseboards is to rubber band a microfiber cloth around the bottom of a broom and then just rub those baseboards or if they have a lot of buildup you might need to use a wipe. Our sponge or something like that and actually, you know you something wet, but if you keep it dusted you can prevent it from getting to grimy other bonus chores in the kitchen living areas.	0.0
And is that like what 6:30 6:45, it's for the yeah. Okay.

Well, I remember I forgot what year it was, but it was in December of one year that I was talking to the people from the after-show and back then I think Steph was kind of like you're not supposed to talk about it. Like it was already starting to get to that point but it wasn't as bad as it got with the rest of the show because they wanted me to get on that show. Show and I was talking to like the people behind that and I was supposed to be on that show and then it kind of stretched a few months. Like I was supposed to be on in December and then that got rescheduled there was some sort of like internal problem with the filming or whatever. So then it was rescheduled to like March or something. And then when we got to March it was like, oh, you know this guy handed off to different people like different Executives that took control over it and then I was kicked off. Then they got whoever I don't know. Who else.	0.0

It's something I never get sick of telling because because I love this lady with all my heart. So when I started teaching I moved two and a half hours away from home. I knew like obviously my wife's family. That's but that's all I knew up here. I didn't know any teachers. I know nothing about the school Trish and I I moved to a town near her hometown. So we were near her family and I started this job at an amazing team that took me in there under their wings and we just we got along super great and we just had a blast together. And at the time we were a team of three teachers and I kept hearing these stories about this teacher who was now in the junior high level. Her name was honor Trotter and she had taught kindergarten. Actually. My room was her kindergarten room before I came and I got to know honor a little bit over the first couple years of teaching because she was doing A junior high like I don't science work, but she's also doing reading Specialists work on our end. So my kids got to go see her every now and then and I just I would spend my break. I know that seems like a weird word and education so we don't really get those but my break with my students would actually get time as a class to go see honor in Reading tight like that await a specific dedicated reading block that she got to take kids and do awesome activities. I found myself not taking a break but sitting and watching her and I was amazed at the way this woman taught and II guess our school didn't really have an official Mentor program at the time but I considered her my mentor because I learned more from her than I ever did from any textbook or any course I ever took and it it wasn't just about teaching it was just about the way she interacted with with not just students but human beings and I use that term a lot when I go out and speak that we need to treat these people in our classrooms and our lives not as students that are walking through a door. But his people is anybody else wants to be treated, you know, so I learned a lot from her on that subject and then When she was close to retirement, she actually came back to kindergarten she joined our kindergarten because our numbers were growing and she went to our board and our Administration said listen. I know you're going to be hiring kindergarten. Please. Let me finish up my career there where I started and of course they were like, yeah, let's do it. So I want to say I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but maybe the last five six seven years of her career were spent in kindergarten and I got to be a part of her team. It was it was awesome. We were team before for a while then a team of five them sema4 went back and forth, but it was always Myself, my neighbor Tiffany and Lori who were my three what I started and then honor it was always the four of us plus another 1 or minus another one and honored just to just was just an awesome person in the working with and getting to learn from her and then two years before she was about to retire. She was kind of forced into early retirement because she was diagnosed with cancer that forced her to stop teacher Chic. She had to take care of herself as she was weakening. She only made it about nine months. After she was diagnosed and I'll never forget when she called me up one day. I still remember I was laying on my couch watching a movie phone rings. It was like a Saturday and it was her and she was he come over for a minute and she lived like a half hour from where I live. So it's like yeah. Yeah, like what what's up, you know and my daughter was I think to at the time so she was probably napping and I just looked at Trisha. I'm like I need to go to honors house and she's like for what it's like I really don't know and I knew that she had been out and having some medical issues. I didn't know that it was going to be big and she sits me down a couch and tells me that she has cancer and of course as anybody would I lost it I started crying and I didn't know what to think and she didn't shed a tear. She's smiling at me and I looked at him like what are you doing? Like, how are you know said she goes she goes I've cried out of my I cried when I got the diagnosis, but she goes I've learned to accept the fact that there's a reason that I have cancer and and how it blew my mind. I mean, I probably jaw dropped look they're like, what do you mean there's a reason like no, there's no For a reason for this and she truly was the most hopeful person in the world. She believed that there was a purpose to her being diagnosed with cancer and I know the stories going on. I apologize for rambling but there's a point to this there really is. So I guess the point this is that that there was never specific lesson from her that she came out and said this is the way you should be treating people or here's a lesson on kindness or here's a lesson on bullying or is she there was never a specific thing that I recall a my mind at all it started with that moment when she Said to me there's a purpose for this and at that time I had no idea that it was becoming it was I had no idea. I mean no one thought she's gonna pass away as fast. She did we just we didn't really know and then when we lost honor we never got to find out what she thought her purpose was, right? So honored passed away nine months after diagnosis, May 6th of 2013 and the week after her funeral or that actually three days after she passed away was her birthday birthday is May 9th and on that day our entire Will went out back and we bought I don't remember how much I think we bought 60 because it was gonna be on her 60th birthday on May 9th. We bought 60 yellow balloons and released them one of our past PE teachers who had taught With Honor for 30 plus years brought little yellow bracelets to the school for everyone like rubber bracelets, you know that said honoring Honor on them. She given to every student staff member like thousands of these bracelets were headed out and I just remember being out on this lawn with our entire School telling stories of her microphone. Everybody got to kind of share their story about honor that was close to her. We sang Happy Birthday. We let these balloons go and and something about that day and the I don't have image the balloons were yellow honors favorite color was yellow. So that's the reason for the yellow balloons the yellow bracelet. She just loved the color yellow and that day became an image. I guess that was etched into our school forever now because it's continued but so fast forward again, and that year went on we all made it. Through the school year a new year started and then things started to seem kind of weird as they would if you lost, you know a family member best friend are our building just didn't seem the same we knew she was still there, but we can still hear her laugh in the hallway. We knew she was there but something struck me as something I guess important in the fact that I needed to find a way or we as a team or a teacher group or a school need to find a way to keep her alive in our building as much as possible and to do that on my end. I mean, we've all done our own share of things of sharing her story of an item. High-end, I wrote a book about her and it was a book called yellow that Shameless plug here. You can find on Amazon or you know, you don't have to buy my book. You can go to my YouTube channel teachers learn to dot common and see a free video of me reading it to your class. So check that out. But anyway, I wrote this book as a way to keep her alive because I felt there were so many students and staff cheated out of getting to know her and I felt lucky that I got to write. So I wrote this book. I got to start traveling around to schools as an author of all things which Blew my mind because I just wrote this just for her, you know sharing honor story. And the reason that was brought up was because her story was all about just making people happy and there's a line on the book that says Honor made people's gray skies into yellow Skies or turn people's gray skies and yellow skies because that's what she did and it wasn't. I mean, I know there's so many kindness campaigns out there then they're all great, but hers wasn't about doing anything for anyone. It wasn't about doing a random act of kindness. It was more so that she got people to realize the good in. Side themselves just like being the person she was and I know that sounds kind of confusing but I don't know how she did it. But she made you feel like the best person in her life. No matter what it was and she just found a way to make everybody smile and make you very happy. Yeah, and that's the kind of kindness that she spread was just getting other people to feel good. It wasn't going out of her way to do anything. She was just that type of human being she made everybody feel special special. Yeah an important and noticed, you know, And she made you feel good about yourself. She brought out something in me that I don't know. I'd ever experienced before you know, so I keep saying this but fast forward again and I think three or four years after she had passed away we decided to keep her birthday celebration going but even more and Anna term had come up from my book called make someone's day yellow and we just kept using that over and over again in our building would skip say to make someone's day LSA make someone's day yellow today rather than saying like pay it forward. We just said make someone's day yellow And we decided to do that. So we on May 9th three years ago, four years ago. Whatever. The first one was. We decided to celebrate honors birthday at our school with what we call Yellow day and we did just kind things all day long. We decorate our entire school to look yellow. I mean balloons streamers posters. Everything was turned yellow we did do random acts of kindness for people around the building. So we delivered like flowers to the secretaries and just rope notes to teachers and random people saying smile today are hope you have the best day ever. Or thank you for being you just things that honor would have done without really knowing them we decided to do purposefully, right and after it happened after yellow to happen. I videoed the whole thing. I put on my YouTube channel and about two weeks after the day. I got a message from a teacher and I look at the location. It was from Australia, and it blew my mind that someone lost really was even watching my little YouTube channel, right? I looked at the comment and said thank you for sharing this message. We're going to try to do a yellow day at our school and I I remember running to school the next day like oh my gosh you guys check this out someone in Australia is going to do our celebration like it's going to spread and then these emails and messages started coming in at one after another after another after another and and over the past three years of doing yellow day at our building and then spreading around other schools and other states and other countries we've hit I think eight different countries where we've seen yellow Day celebrated and 35 different states within the u.s. I can't count the number of schools that it's reached. The number of people it's reached but yellow day has become a movement is what we've used the term as As you know and going back to an honor was diagnosed and what this all meant. I truly believe that everything that happens in your life is done for a purpose whether you want to believe in a higher being or not or what your beliefs are. It doesn't matter to me. Everything happens for a reason. Let's not deny that fact there's a reason behind everything that happens and I never forget two years ago on the other day when it was really getting big and blowing up. We were getting messages from schools left and right and people post on social media like picture after picture after picture after picture. A bunch of us teachers were standing outside my classroom door talking and showing sharing images of images that we were tagged in after school. And one of our first grade teachers Donna walks by and she goes this is it Adam and I said, excuse me, and she is this is the purpose and I said, what do you mean and she goes this is why honor had cancer and I lost it like a probabilistic. I lost it. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's true. Like we never got to find out what honor believed her purpose for having cancer was until that day and we truly feel like her reason for being diagnosed.	1.0
Do you think well, I mean what happened if the Central Bank does no longer increase the money supply so its own money. Yeah, right or if it doesn't increase it enough so that people who have been counting on the stronger increases. I left in the cold as we've seen lat. Actually quite with the liquidity issues on new are so if something of this at this can spill over right and that's also the reason why the Central Bank step very vigorously in and prevented that interest rates would rise further and panic would Spread spread and so on so under these circumstances, there's no definition of a meltdown, right? But of course my solving a problem springing from debt with more credits. You do not provide a true solution. Yes problems. Right? I mean, this is something that most people are understood that we are in a very tired are paradoxical situation. They were trying to solve problems bringing from debt with there are more credit. This of course observe because we are just reproducing the problems that we had in the past on a higher level almost exactly as Marx put it in the capitalist system reproduces his own problems on a larger scale because it's not difficult to guess.	0.0

Dance spoiler alert guys, Brandon Armstrong was here before Daniela because we pre-taped an episode that's going to are October 22nd because I'll be in Barcelona so I know I can't wait but he was bragging about the two of you. He's so sweet and but everyone's really appreciative of your talents and what you guys are both bringing to the show this year.	1.0
But yeah. Was great. It was doc said probably the best I've seen apply especially especially under Noona if we just take our chances are many times. I need to keep saying and that game would have been out of sight and in the second half we wouldn't have happened. Well, it obviously would have happened but you know, we put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that second half a lot of unneeded pressure. Is that deeper and deeper which have been conscious of in the past few seasons. Anyway, I Watford New Year if I could Braga. Yeah, so it yeah, the first off was great should have put the going to bed, but it's one of those Delivered when it was terrible probably the worst team us. I've seen this either. I'm not just saying that because of the villa and there are local Royal.	0.0
All right, so we got past that bullshit laundry and dishes neither of them ever end. No ever they don't laundry Nate.	0.0

Yeah, Kenny jackett changed it.	1.0

All right, if let's do that Nick bow. So it number one to the Arizona Cardinals Josh Allen to the 49ers Quinton Williams joins Leonard Williams on the Jets Devon white, too. The Raiders ratio on Gary goes to Tampa Bay Kayla Marie the newest Giants backup quarterback. We'll see if that goes well John Taylor to Jacksonville Montez sweat is on his way to Detroit and Oliver is in Buffalo Dwayne Haskins will be Joe Flacco's back up in Denver and Andre Dillard the tackle from Washington State goes to Cincinnati with 11 according to this simulation. So Tyler Alice Q if you had to pick which player would you want to take at 12?	1.0
So don't think it'll take a like I'm bragging. I'm just trying to say how it works for us financially and up it to be efficient. I bought a bull at the NFR sell two years ago, but we call him 100x helmets Boot Hill. Well, I guess 3500 for him at the NFR sell two years ago taking him to the National Finals twice and the other day at Sacramento PBR. They are Vieira was 89 on them want to short go on him, you know, and I know that that doesn't always work out like that. I'm not being trying to be naive either that that it always works out like that but like him or the bull jive turkey that they the other Brazilian boy rows are in the short goat Sacramento. I bought Josh Last year at the enough ourselves. I give 6,000 for him. He come from Toby Floyd and and that and he was like $89 88-89 on him a guy can put by a really damn good bull anymore.	1.0
this is such a trip like we're all just doing our best and figuring things out at like a really Scribbly way and my thing it's like I forget everything I learn all the time. And so having people sort of bear witness to you and how you're doing and remember for you and you remembering for them and like everyone can like hold up a loving mirror and ask questions about why you believe the things you believe like Human beings are designed to need each other. And what's dope about that is it like once that need is met like it feels really good and it feels really safe and it feels really complete. And so even if you feel like a maniac especially if you're like a woman, especially if you are like a woman of color or you are just not like you're like average cishet, you know, like monoculture like mono conscious person who's like quote normal or a quote like skin-toned, you know, like yeah, like it's just a way to like take small defiant actions to like take up space and to like reaffirm your own agency, you know, not dump not like pollute not take advantage, but just like command that attention. Um and have and like amplifying other people and inviting them to do it to like, you know, I'm literally sitting here recording a mini pod on the floor about asking how are you like that's where I like that's the key to Wellness. Like it really really helps me and it's free. You know, so I hope you find some utility in that and I hope you have a gentle day and I hope you find small reassuring ways to accept the flavor of brain that you have in like hopefully grow to love it and appreciate it.	1.0
So hopefully you get the concept of everything that's good. Let's talk a little bit about Derek Hough because I'm sure let's talk about Derek because obviously he's had a huge history on Dancing With the Stars but Working with him really started with World of Dance where he was a judge for you. Do you think that he saw you and you know Pasha dance and it probably was thinking I want to work with these two at some point in the future.	1.0
But if you're setting an amazing example, yeah, you guys will never forget that tour and even if there was like some tension between choreographers or if something wasn't working and everyone was getting like kind of frustrated. How come I can't get this stuff red wherever he went into the room and right away. His presence just makes Feel like I got this like he's just such a positive person. So it was it was just great like no matter what or how you felt when he entered the room. You just knew everything was going to be okay and you can get through this.	1.0
How about socks? Oh my God. Fuck.	0.0
I think I'm going to ask.	1.0
Yeah, and the field wasn't huge. I have to say a lot of people also dnf'd and there was the option to At a certain point you could decide if you wanted to continue doing a hundred and nine or instead do the 69k option and a few people chose that option. I was determined to finish. I want to buy cowboy hat, which is what you've got if you finish the hundred and nine case, but yeah, I don't know. I just um, I just pulled it along with you just want to always do just just put a lot to take a checkpoint to checkpoint Jenga homework. I do feel nauseous for myself. The day I felt quite it all I didn't eat a whole lot that. I really kept my fluids and electrolytes. And so yeah, that was more electrolytes taking it slow heat up. Yeah, excellent. And if you give to give the to give the listener and not some idea it was 10 degrees above 10 degrees Celsius above normal. So about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and probably a little bit less maybe 70 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit above the normal temperature. Tommy year so it was really a guy that gets fixed. It's a very exposed area there.	1.0
Thank you. So this is episode.	1.0
Yeah. Okay. Why are we so you don't have any excuses what you're saying?	1.0
Is he planning on heading back to New York and and teaching and I don't know if he doesn't If he if things don't work out and if he doesn't do the tour, I think he's probably going to go and just do the best that you can teaching and improving himself because you still want to take lessons.	1.0

Yeah, and I mean, I it's not like I reached out to say hey, like what do you think about this offer? Because I would not you know take that seriously, but someone had texted me and had that response and I was like, I can't not share this because Twitter was going crazy people were believing this guy for some reason and so we put that to bed. Well Oliver. Well, I want to see the one thing that didn't dawn on. till now that would have you know, I never needed to panic because I scheduled a really early morning flight back and with the stopped at Chicago because I assumed that's the flight that the Indians front office Executives would take turns out they took a later flight closer to lunchtime. So they were in the air when all that was going down and when you had texted me and so I don't know why I panicked because I think they're means would have been pretty limited engaged in quote unquote serious talks as aunt.	1.0
I think it is the repeating like that's what triggered Nate like it was halfway into that. I still oh my God, I would I took way too much pleasure in it because it was just like it was so funny to see him go there but I think what really triggered him was actually like some of the audio Clips he started listening to him and was like, hey, it's season one and then Bangalore. Hey, it's season one caustic. Hey, it's season one.	1.0
I'm so happy to be here.	1.0

They pull their way out and then they'll start talking to you. Some of them come to the hospital. Some of them don't someone tell us to peace out. But yeah, we want these people to be transported to the hospital or at least if they refuse service to be with somebody to be monitored because Locks on will have a shorter shelf life. It will burn off faster in their system than the opiates.	1.0
But I always I feel like it's so much fear because I remember feeling I remember being on the opposite side of that I could see myself introducing someone as a non-Christian back in the day, not tomorrow. Yeah, but I was I love God so much and I have for so long that if anyone didn't have that and then and then when I can Christian church or an Evangelical Church when they're pounding into our heads like you said, this is your identity. This is the thing that gives you purpose. This is where true happiness. Flies I just felt sad for people that didn't have that. I wanted them to have like salvation. And then when I was even younger I was so scared of everyone going to hell. I was like, oh God, I love Nicole so much. I really don't want her to go to Holland is actually like excuse perience a genuine heartbreak on both and and it's not healthy for either party.	1.0

I'm and like that thing was just wheelie and all the way on wait a minute. Yeah, did we know that we both had Saiyans at one point? What was it? I had a Scion tC. Yeah, he's black TC. I had a black XP. That's why I don't think I don't think we've ever talked about this. I don't think we have we'll do a whole episode on silent. They don't even make them anymore. Mine was basically a Pepsi can on Wheels is what I kind of thought of it was a hollow a scar Paolo. I liked that. It was a hollow car basically, so now he was cool. So at the time, you know, I moved out Here I didn't have a plan on the way out. I did apply for a job at Backcountry.com and a lot of my friends at the time work there as well. And I was thinking, you know, I'll just apply and I'll work in the call center. You know, right? I'll talk gear. I know gear I ride for companies. This is great yadda. And on the drive out. I actually about six hours away. I got a call and I got the job. He does awesome. So that was really cool. And at the time a job was a job. I was just going to snowboard and I always had film and you know video to you. No lie back on it in case something didn't work out. Which was really really cool. So I don't feel like in school. I learned as much as I could have. Yeah, but I knew once I started going in the right field and working for people that I could keep developing those skills, right? So what was really cool about Backcountry as is I was there for two months and I get an email about job openings via email like internal and one of the jobs was for video and I'm like, okay, they're building out a new video program. This is great. This is this is a big opportunity for me. I apply instantly boom. I don't hear back for a month I hit. Back, I'm like, there's no way I got this but it's worth.	1.0

Pete Rock true true Metro Boomin shout out the st. Louis Metro Boomin. Definitely. He was part of the the new age sound as well like the the current sound and also want to throw in Tyler the Creator. I think he's very underrated as an as a producer but he's definitely one of my favorites today as long as he's still making music. I just met my best results and I messed with this new sound. He definitely evolved a lot. So those are just so many people that I want to mention. It's definitely a lot more but To the one that I just wanted to to mention besides but the people to flock are you mentioned so it's a lot of good producers man. I just want to say that a lot of good producers back back in the day and and up until today. I know everybody's like looking for the new sound and I guess like right now you say like Pierre Pierre born. This is one of the people who has a lot of sounds that a lot of people emulate take Keith. I feel like he he does a lot of frickin Beast that sound the same to he's finally trying to expand but he would definitely do a lot of a lot of bees that sounded the exact same and I was like what the hell is is but a lot of you trying to lay his stuff. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's as far as well. I can think of right now, but but she also produces man because like I said everyone for y'all, I really think that a lot of these people would sound pretty wack in my opinion a lot of influences our name that man.	1.0
Yep, so guys this is our first podcast of big facts podcast. If you guys want whatever you're listening is on. I wouldn't know what you're listening in on.

I'm not a liar the fact that you're an atheist. Yeah and like that. I recommend your channel to so many people who comment on my videos because yeah because like you do not at all represent the things that I am opposed to you know, like and I think it goes back to this idea of when I was a Christian and when I would kind of be going Like what you're going through trying to defend gay marriage and like all these things. I was always very analytical of this idea of God and in my head I was like if you're telling me that he's a loving God. I feel like we have to be able to attribute certain qualities to this deity. And so often when you are kind of like the girl to find girls who are living in this Christian bubble who like just read the scripture in her.	0.0
Oh my gosh, you know just like secondhand anger at someone else's content with life if that makes any sense. Yeah, that's it. Again. You see how people in relationships and you're like fuck them. Yeah, that's like a big big thing that to this day. I'm working on conquering you know what I mean be another comes conception with depression is that one are going to be like done not suppress. That's not how fucking work. Yes, literally. It's just I mean it's going to keep coming back. So you better get used to it. You better be nice to yourself and you better learn how to tame it. It's like it goes thoughts feelings behaviors. Yeah. So like if you get a nasty thought try to cut it like nip it in. The bud isn't becomes a feeling in your feelings feel real now that it can become a behavior. Yep, you know, definitely it's a cycle so and yeah, then sometimes the behaviors could take over because So tired you can just sleep and it just feel everything perpetuates. Yeah the thing so literally it's to be as simple as being like this thought is wrong. Oh, my feelings are not real. Yeah. It's are valid control of your brand. Yeah. Absolutely. And again, that's the number one number. One thing I'm concerned about with people who just run to medicine is that they're not actually addressing the thoughts and taking control of them. They're just putting metal BT C BT exactly. Cognitive behavioral therapy not to because you have to find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia, you're straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms another big thing. That's big wrong. Yeah, but yeah another think therapists a good therapist not easy to find you now. I'm so sorry. I have a good one now. Yeah Isabel therapist actually yet. My I just I hadn't sanaka therapist. Yeah, one of my therapist was like yo look, I've seen you for a year now and this is what I think is going on. I could lose my license for this but I'm going to say it you're being haunted by a demon and I was like hon, I'm paying you $60. I'm paying you say. Yeah. I was a session to tell me that I have a fucking demon in me.	0.0
Yes. Stop grunts. A moral of the story is I would think everybody has some form of anxiety and I think if you were saying no, you're kind of full of baloney because I think any denial Lingus you're doing here in denial is not everywhere in Egypt. Yeah Egypt. Yes. Anyway home and gen Wu I would say yeah, I mean On everybody is affected by it, you know obviously severity is going to change to you're not alone. I think that's the most important thing and three if you need help ask for help, like there are people there that to help you there are there are resources all over the place. I'm sure we could probably pull up a list of yeah, but put a list of resources together. That would be good for no notes who we show notes. We're also going to have some we have some in fact check. Yeah, there's no facts here. This is all just opinion. Actually we should probably	1.0

So it was like three days before we had to leave to that in like early. I'm not going anywhere. What are you talking about? Its International dancesport Championship, but you listen to surely don't you I did you're supposed to supposed to and then she's like, I don't care you're going I was like, okay. Well, if you say so I went to LA and I saw Derek there and he's like, oh, this is so awesome. Like and I think he remembered me from yeah, that's what he was like, yes, but then we did that music video and it was just so successful like we had so many views on it and people loved it. They were sharing it for like a year after that. So it was insane. Well, actually it's been it's almost been a it's almost that here.	1.0
You don't share a lot of experiences and you know. Just enjoy we both both my cousin's we literally can just be in bed. Chill together eat good food. Have a good workout and just do the simple things in life. And it really doesn't matter what we do when I'm with them. It's just as long as we're together and I think that's the beauty of it is. It's very low maintenance, you know, just as long as we have each other we find gratitude in that and it's always a good time, you know, but with you know, Richard Nico both of them, you know, they Have they're like my best friend's, you know, they've been my best friends ever since I was younger and you know, keep it real with you guys, you know, as you get older things change feelings change people change. There's a lot of movement in life. And sometimes you forget about the people that helped you get to where you are and I think for me by my you know, the blessing my mom. She had told me a couple weeks ago that because it's miss me and and I wanted Create consistency and effort and shows them that I miss them too. And I know it's been hard and I know it's hasn't been things. Haven't been the same. So it's kind of like having that body bit about bodybuilding mentality, like whatever your weak points are in a relationship like focus on those like all the people in Sacramento. Like I see them consistently. I see my baby girl Cindy all the time. I see Kev, you know weekly, you know, it's about maybe investing time in to the people that you don't see a whole lot like I don't see my sister's a whole lot. My nephew's a whole lot my cousins a whole lot. So I think this year I definitely want to have a better goal of strengthening the relationship those types of relationships.	1.0

So you say something funny and then it beeps? He says something funny on command. We're testing it out fucking will be. So today mean Isabelle going to be talking about depression Isabel's my cyst and we both have depression. So that's why we're talking about it today both think we can offer some advice and just share our experiences with it. A lot of people say that they have depression when they don't and they're just sad so there's like a difference between being depressed and just sad so I'm going to read the DSM-5 criteria, so It says the individual must be experiencing 5 or more of these symptoms during a two-week period and they are depressed mood most of the day nearly everyday markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement that eager loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day recurrent thoughts of death recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. Rude, yeah, rude, they are so rude. That is so rude. Yeah. Hit me where it hurts the most. Yeah. Yeah, so When did you kind of realize like you have that like, oh shit moment. Like I have depression it was with you. Actually we were in we're going to see our dad and Florida and you're just hanging out on the beach and I said, I was 12 I said hey. Even when you get in the car, do you sometimes like like not want to put your seatbelt on just like if you get in a car accident, so you'll die in the not have to wake up and you said no. Nope, I don't remember that at all. Wow. Yeah, so I realized that no one else around you want to get hit by a bus. Yeah, and like everyone has different like Degrees of depression so when I say have depression, I mean very recently after our father passed away. I got depressed but I wouldn't say like I've clinical depression all the time. Mmm. It was a very depressed period of my life. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself depressed. But as you would, you know, well, that's a big difference to like there's a normal scale of like grief that people experience but mine was passed that they're like, there's no right way to grieve. Yeah. But I think my grief turned into severe depression because it lasted for like a year and it became well, that's when it persists. It's that's what it's different. Yeah, but it was far too hard DSM-5. Yes, but it was triggered by something. So whereas yours was just like always kind of present your whole life. Yeah. I can look back and be like, yeah like yeah, we saw that I would always say like and as well as also bipolar Sorry by pulling impressive. Yeah. Yeah, so but I remember thinking when I was six like there's a good Isabel on a bad Isabel and we pretend that she had an evil twin named Bethany. Oh, yeah, let's Bethenny. Yeah. And so whenever like we'd be eating at the dinner table, Bethany would be looking at me with like these dagger eyes and I feel like I can't tell my mom the Bethany's here. Like I have to pretend it's Isabelle like yeah, I get so nervous. Like Bethenny would be in the card. Like I remember just being terrified of When Bethenny came out no one was having a good day. Yeah savagery. Yeah, it was savagery. But I think one thing people don't realize about depression is how much of your life that you miss out on and just completely blank on like Olivia has this whole memory. I don't have any memory of it at all. I didn't remember Bethany until she just said Bethenny right now and like I'm assuming that's the right name, but I don't Bethenny, but I don't have a memory of it. We would do it at summer camp to to like freak out the kids out. Hmm. So and I was so used to it. It was so normal for me. Yeah, but other people I'm sure thought we were like crazy. Yeah. Is the point I'm trying to make is that depression can take away periods of your life with leaving you with no memory almost like holes and associating kind of not associating you look back and you don't remember anything. Yeah, like literally have memories that people have your brain is empty. Yeah. That's very sad. Emptiness is a good word. I think but it really do be like that. So I really do be like that it really do. I think this is like so after my dad died, I remember one day I was going on a run and I usually love to run but this run was hard and then all of a sudden I just started like sobbing. And like it hit me like then that I wanted to kill myself and like that's what I all I could think about the whole run was how is going to kill myself when I got home? No when I got home, but like in the future like when I was going to do it all this stuff and I just told my mom right away. I was just like this is very abnormal for me. Like I got put on an antidepressant and it helped immediately almost But that was a phase of my life where if I am afraid to go off my antidepressants because like what if I do have depression now mmm, you know, and it's just the medicine just works. So well, you know and it's not like that for everyone that comes so lucky that like it was a period, you know, definitely Well medicine is hard because it it only works just to such an extent where you kind of had to put in the work to you know what I mean? Like it'll give you the tool in your toolbox exact. It's not the whole box. Yeah, definitely. So on top of it to the Press since it doesn't mean you can just take a pill like go about your day. You actually have to actively like tell your brain. Hey, dude, shut the fuck up. Yeah, you'll lot of things you don't need. Kill yourself you genuinely don't ya and sometimes it's like reminding yourself like all the good things you have which sounds really cheesy but that's actually helped me a lot just sitting on my bedroom floor. I'm being present and being great. Yeah and like Isabel like it's so good. Like she'll go outside with her crystals and like charger crystals and do some like stretching like she didn't need to do that before she does things for herself now, like go to like comedy nights and stuff, which I think is really awesome. And she's definitely like has come a long way. It's all comes down. Down to just being kind to yourself. You can't be angry at yourself for not making progress every single day. You're not going to make progress every single day might regress. Yeah, you're going to live with it for your whole life. So you have to be kind to yourself about it and you have to reassure yourself. Like you're not always going to be in this mood and just kind of today not every day is going to be exactly and just keep encouraging yourself and being nice to yourself and the nicer you already yourself the more that like guilt that comes with depression will go away. I think that's kind of also how I knew that I had depression was because I had All this guilt for know that's a big part of it. Yeah, and I was just like there was a point where I was like calling people and saying sorry for things that I didn't even need to say sorry for her because I just couldn't fathom why I was feeling so bad about myself. Yeah. That was like I did something wrong, you know, like these people hate me and I think that's another thing with depression is like it really is storts your view about you're like purpose and your place on this earth like you really do think no one loves you sometime so definitely, but you're not lovable, you know. Mmm. or that it would be better off or you wouldn't be affected and like something that I've had a hard time with is just like I always tell myself now like most things aren't the end of the world. Which is a good thing, but also like the world's going to keep going, you know, yeah, definitely and I think that's a thing that people with depression is just like why am I here? Like, they're very smart people that are depressed. Oh, yeah, definitely have a lot like most people have a higher IQ if they're depressed because they just are so aware of everything that's like going on in the dusty. It's not like when everything is thriving in the world depression rates go up like it's directly correlated with kind of the state of things. Yeah, because people Like we're affected by each other quietly gently genuinely are affected by each other. If you're having a bad day. I I consider myself an empath. I don't have a good day either, you know, like if people that I really love like our are sad like, I can't be happy. Yeah are genuinely happy. For me, I just think it's like I think a lot of the problem is like depression in this first world country when you have all these Comforts is like I literally have no reason to be depressed right now that makes it worse and it makes you make yourself feel guilty. Did you just sit on it? The guilt? The guilt is a really interesting thing. Like I remember being like Five and like putting away like my first tour was ever was like putting away dishes in the dishwasher and there were like big forks and little forks. And I was like, I don't want to separate the little forks from the big Force because like the baby force them on me for seem to be together and I felt like I was like the worst human ever for doing that. You know what I mean? Like I always even then I always needed to have a reason for why I was guilty. Yeah, I would I just felt guilty because I was always so angry. Yeah. Like anger is a secondary emotion, you know? Yeah, definitely. Another thing about being this angry in this cute. Is that when you get angry everyone around you goes? No, you just make me like five to give or take an inch. Yeah, so normally takes us seriously. Yeah, definitely. People laugh when I get mad. Oh, yeah. That's how I know like, okay well, but they're like all that chipmunks having a bad day. I know. Oh, yeah. I feel like there's a lot of stories. I have that about depression that like a lot of things where I'm just like normal quote-unquote like morals neurotypical people just like wouldn't think this way mmm, you know, but like what are some like misconceptions you think about depression that That don't have it. Kind of like Get wrong. I just think the number one thing is that People aren't kind enough to people with depression. They're not patient enough and they expect too much. So they don't view it as something that's seriously chemicals are incorrect in your brain that affects you every day. That is almost like a physical weight on you every day when you wake up. That's not what they do it as they just say like they think you can snap out of it, especially if you're high functioning especially for high functioning like I go to work every single day. I work six days a week and every day someone tells me you like you make my day all the time. You always make me smile, you know, because I'm such a high-functioning depressive and the other day. I said, you know, I am really struggling right now think I got to go see a new therapist or something and there's this almost they said, oh you have depression and I said, yeah and they said I would have never guessed the yeah you had depression because the way you carry yourself. Yeah, it's just but that tape but they don't understand how much effort that takes out of someone. And almost when people tell me that sometimes I'm like, thank you honestly, but also like doesn't have a look. It doesn't have a not always. Yeah, it does sometimes like oh you can't like look at somebody like they're having a bad day. But like eyes exactly why I think it's important to talk about it because you wouldn't expect certain people you wouldn't expect to be depressed and they jammed the happiest people like yeah are depressed like Robin Williams, for example, he was very very depressed and he was always making people laugh. He said something really good about depression, which I think like we need to hear it out. It was like it was something along the lines of yes depression is a crippling illness that is not 100% Like people aren't 100% in control of but I also do believe that if you are not thinking the right things actively eating the right things actively hoping actively loving yourself actively. Then you are not giving yourself a Fighting Chance. That's so true. You cannot just give yourself with who? There was a point at school and I think I tend to get more depressed when I'm stressed and it is depression because like there was a point where I could not get out of my bed for eight days. Yeah. It did not leave my apartment for eight days and all I ate was Oreos. Yeah, and that just perpetuated the cycle. Like if I had healthy food, you know, I probably would have just been invented my like right mind but I literally as well knew I was calling her like crying. I'm like, I was depressed like it was hard. Yeah, and it's hard for me because like we were saying earlier like Olivia wasn't always. This way it was always me so then me seeing the way that I've always been on Libya someone who always be this happy. It was really hard. It was really see ya because a lot of people give me that way too and I wasn't fake either. It was very genuine. So after my dad died, I went on antipsychotics just because I was I needed to be stabilized because I wasn't doing well. I had a lot of PTSD. Yeah, and I didn't laugh for four months and it was the scariest thing because I felt like I couldn't Make emotions. Yeah, I didn't have emotions and it was Yep, jarring yet and that's why when my I feel like my my mood is kind of getting getting really bad. I don't immediately jump the gun and say, okay, let's medicate. I kind of step back and wait it out and be patient with myself and be kind to myself. You can look hopeful for towards the future and then you'll find so much better like think about how you coped back then even versus now like definitely changing holes in walls now you don't do that anymore. Yeah. I know. I'm 90. I can still punch a good hole in the wall. Yeah, I don't do that anymore. Yeah, I just go to hardcore shows. Yeah, we're it so punch other people. Where's okay to hit people. Yeah, they wanted they literally want it. Yeah, it's gonna pay for it. And another thing with depression finding those Outlets that you can be that place where you can see angry at. Yeah, there's always some anger like late and anger. You never really know about. Yeah, but that that bitching third grade Duty told if you're angry that I farted. Yeah when it was her, yeah. Yeah, that would make me angry still. Yeah. Yeah, but like I'm not saying you need to go but all your friends go to all your friends talk about how sad or angry you are, but I personally like my best friend. We love ranting to each other above pick things that make us angry to friend you leave that person to we're not each other's therapist, but it sounds fuck I fighting to fucking go off. You know what I mean? Like she's there to listen and she thinks it's funny. You know what I yeah, like again when I'm small but I'm angry like Funny regardless, yeah, so having that person that you guys kind of both enjoy and you feed off each others, like fuck this and you kind of just get that out for today Twitter was invented. That's why Twitter was invented. Yeah, honestly, like it's so good for like my depression because I'm just psyched about Twitter. Yeah. I heard about Twitter. My favorite thing about Twitter is when the mainstream media goes Okay, we're going to put together this story. For example Epstein yet committed suicide. Hope it works. They sends it out immediately Twitter. Oh how motherfucking convenient a billionaire with tons of dirt commit suicide. So K and it just immediately air quotes immediately on Twitter everyone blew up and was like, yeah. No and that's why I love Twitter. I love Twitter and it's a conglomerate a fucking Pete. I love those like memes that go viral. It's just like my depression my eating disorder my anxiety like all meeting up and it's like all those people doing the damn. Yeah, I love that like then it yeah, I mean, I think another another misconception that depressed people or mentally ill people have is mentally ill people have is that they're in this alone like no one understands what they're going through. That's not the fucking case. There are literally millions of people that feel actually exactly the way that you do and I'm sure neither of you can describe that feeling because it's okay and that's why No one thinks that anyone feels like them. Yes, but you have to communicate and be like no dude. I feel big sad sometimes to fix a big sad and that's okay. You know, I think another moment where I realized I had depression was where I was like laying down in bed with my friend and he was trying to tell me that like there was like more to life than like than what I was seeing and he was like people love you like your friends just all came over and you like made them all breakfast and like all the stuff and I was like, no one loves me like yeah, I'm like unlovable and I was crying and I didn't want anyone like like nothing anyone said could change the fact that I thought no one loved me. Yeah. Yep, or did I was like, there's nothing you can say and he was just like so sad like he was crying. Yeah, and I was like, why are you upset and he was like cuz I care about you and I was like, I don't know what yeah. Yeah, but once one time when I realized I was not in a good spot was when you my boyfriend, we're going to Chick-fil-A and big complex of just like people going and shopping and shit and there was like a really happy family of like a mom and a dad. Three kids. They're all like gigglin the kid was holding the mom's hand. I just gestured out the window and loudly said I don't want to see that. Really? Yeah, and then there was like Isabel, that's a perfectly Pleasant situation.	0.0

I think if we could go back we could have been a little a little bit looser with our promiscuity, you know in the thing is as we had very strict boundaries for what most people would say because well first of all, both of us were grown up adults and he had his own house and you know, he could have had me we could have been hanging out at the house, but that was one of our things we didn't go in the house together. Ourselves unless there was somebody there I most definitely did not go into his room whether he was there or not. I didn't go in his room. Like there was just some things that I felt like it was very clear boundaries. We weren't like laying down together on the couch. Like there was just things, you know, there's just things staying staying horizontal. No staying vertical don't stay here. Don't stay horizontal staying vertical, you know, while you're hanging out that's that's one way to make sure that certain things, you know. Staying pure and so we would say, you know, we look back on our dating and though we were very very strict, you know more than most people that you know, I don't know we can't really compare but probably very strict and in comparison to what most Christians would say that was their dating boundaries and I would say if we would go back we would definitely be more strict because the thing is you cannot steal something from marriage in your dating time and then be fulfilled fully like you're supposed to be in marriage the same.	0.0

I think so we started at 6:00 and I feel it's just before midnight. So look, I was pretty happy with that. I really this was the first event really wasn't sure what my time is going to be. Also, I did serve Christ two weeks ago. So I was a bit tired and you don't back on other ways mainly, so how are you managing your recovery between these all these big races? Well, I don't like tapering. I pretty much do everything. Everyone says you shouldn't do Don't really take the much. I hate it. This one I stop moving my body just seems to Fall to Pieces. So I just keep moving. Yeah, you know, I don't I didn't let the day after the skinny remote right was going to go for a walk. I would normally would in the end I didn't so, it's Monday. I went for a run today. I went to run I'm not huge like tip yesterday was 10ks today living pays and quite slow so down. I just watched. I just enjoy it. I have to keep moving and Yeah. Yeah, just what what's your version of the quite slow? What today was about six minute codes? Yeah, okay, because I was going to say because you can move so just run with you. You know, I couldn't I couldn't endure. I guess I'm not I wouldn't consider myself someone whom is faster Speedy, but I seem to be able to put along and keep going. So yeah just before	1.0

I guess when you're feeling the vibe and if the vibe is like a half hour after you meet them or if the vibe is like six years after you meet them like when you're feeling that Vibe. Okay? Yeah, okay. I don't remember the last time I sent one to somebody other than you. So like I'm not sure but it's so funny though because I like love like an unsolicited dick pic. I think I'm in the minority of this category of women. That's like surprised me with a knife. little present like like I'm at work or I'm getting ready to go well and you're getting ready to go out. You're about to get in the shower. Send me a dick pic. I'll be like, yes. Thank you so much. I'll like maybe I'll someone back probably not probably felt like I don't know why I just love that like little surprised. Do you save them? If they send it through text, yeah, I don't delete any of my texts. Like what do you like save the photo to your photos or like you just leave it in the thread. I have saved them to my photos because like what of might accidentally get deleted but why do you need to save them because what if I want to look at it later, what if I put that like compare and contrast? Like I said if I could curate a whole Art Exhibit I said a museum earlier, but now it's an Art Exhibit that dick pic. I just feel like that's my what my life work should be.	1.0

Exactly. Well, that's the one thing I was kind of fearing was like cause you played a bit of the multiplayer to you kind of got you you kind of got them familiar with some of these people who are like Titanfall veterans where they were grappling and then once they got like to a certain speed you basically could just go around the map by sliding and sliding and jumping over and over and never losing speed and every time you do you use the grapple, right? So exactly like I think that would make it pretty hard for Apex just because time to kill is just so much slower in Apex and if someone's moving that fast it might be a little bit difficult true true about it.	1.0

You're following once remarked after an international tour how infrequently people ask how she's doing and it how how all these responses like are so like responses on social media or even in person usually are so blithe and they're like positive assumptive.

And then they also will have an association for the rest of their lives with like broccoli being this thing to be avoided at all costs instead, maybe find a vegetable that they actually just enjoy or like a way to have them eat more nutritious foods without trying to trick or force them.	0.0
You know, I do believe that there is Merit to some of these like Health Trends or these different things that are being promoted now sure but 100% you should always experiment and try something on for yourself and then decide for yourself if it works for you. Don't take anything. Even sometimes what your doctor is telling you like. Nobody knows more about your body and what something feels like in your own experience than you do. With intuitive eating it's like you have to develop that strong internal Compass so that you know when something sits right because you know, I use this example all the time but like something like broccoli for example is generally considered a healthy food, right? So it's like maybe you think I need to be eating more broccoli or like even if I don't like the taste of broccoli, it's healthy. I should be eating it. Some people may eat broccoli and get horrible gas or a terrible stomach ache and like not be able to function because Are so bloated for the rest of the day for that person maybe broccoli is actually not a healthy choice and maybe they can find another vegetable that works for them. So if their Doctor is recommending them to eat more broccoli, it's just not going to be the thing for them.	0.0

So welcome to the Green Bay Packers daylan machen that a wrap up the six-man draft class for the smartdraft simulation from a draft Network here for 2019 notable players afterwards to the underground forward. Jajuan Johnson to the Browns David long to the Vikings sudden Smith to the Titans Antoine Wesley to the Eagles Darius Slayton to Denver white rate of the Rams. Will Grier going to the Patriots to they maybe get another backup quarterback that could be trade bait in four years. Titus Howard to the Falcons final pick of this for round mock was Michael Jackson from Miami over to Philadelphia. So if there are no trays and in the dream scenario, this would be how the Packers would Shape Up according to what Tyler and I have decided to do Brian Burns goes to 12 and no offense goes at 30 Debo Samuel at 44 one Thornhill at 75 Connor McGovern and 114 and daylan Mac at 118 if That were to be the case and if all these pics were to end up in Green Bay, I would be Beyond ecstatic. I would not sleep very well. I would be full of adrenaline and looking forward to driving up to Green Bay and August for training camp and sitting at the fence watching these guys work in pads and making 2019 one of the more exciting years entering that I've had in a while.	1.0

But back, then it's really hard to get and Equipment because it because this point was he angry or just starting you can just get a go online and buy it online that it's really hard or you're gonna import it into States or into the other countries, which is more expensive if we get everyday real ship that right. So you started to train at home how to train at home was very happy. Not really not really right once I got my first bearing bar. That's the again faster. I bought it online from UK. So this is really expensive because I really want to drop the bar. I don't know what well then the problem with the neighbors games like every time I do it at that even doing it after six just in the morning, but of course Every time I drop the bar the floor is shaking. So, you know, you know how it goes and the house is here in Holland the really too close to each other. It's like after you fart the neighbors could hear it. That's how close it is. So yeah try to minimize that and control all my movements. So it's not really that fun. So I tried to kept going more often to open gyms up into the Says and box that were trained off.	0.0
So those are just some thoughts there and another fun idea for a living area at one of my houses. I did not have very much counter space. So I set up a coffee station in the formal dining room, which was perfect because in that house when you first walked in your in a foyer area with a piano in a bookcase, that's when my kids would make a mess with the bookcase, but I hadn't really thought that through and it looked nice there.	0.0
You know, it's one of the highest level caliber competitions. It brings out some of the best competitors in the world the best competitors in the World in nogi, grappling and it's a good time for us to watch what they're doing and try to figure out if the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is changing and I know we've done an episode before on The Meta but I'm just going to do a quick review in case you forgot what that is. So the meta is usually short for the metagame and in it means actually two things in game theory in sports the metagame refers to anything outside of the Actual game that influences the game a good example would be like the crowd the crowd is outside the game but depending on their volume level or you know, whether you're on the home team or the away team, the crowd is a part of the metagame that will influence in some intangible, you know, maybe slight ways the outcome or the performance of The Players. So that's sort of one definition in sports in gaming particularly in Competitive Gaming The Meta is something A little different an acronym and it stands for the most effective tactic available. And when people use the term meta or someone is playing on meta with that means is that the professional level players will be using the most effective tactic available because they're professionals and it's very high stakes and you know, they want to win clearly. when me and you practice rolling in the gym we may or may not be on meta which is some of us may have sort of unique games that work well for us, but they wouldn't work well for other people or players and then some of us may not be competitors or maybe we're casual competitors and we have things that work well, but they wouldn't encounter diminishing returns as you got to the highest levels of the game, or maybe they don't even work well at all, you know, there's a lot of And I've certainly been one of them before where I've fallen in love with moves that when I think about it, they were actually fairly low percentage. But those few times that I would hit it. I'd feel really good about myself, you know, something really exotic like a go-go plot or something like that. No offense. If you're a gogoplata player, I just sort of pick something that came to mind. If you ask an average person what the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is right. Now almost all of them would say like locks that we are kind of in this golden age of leg locks. That have started to come to prominence probably more or less in the last 10 years. But really I'd say in the last, you know, three to five years is when it's really really started to accelerate and people are wondering and I'm certainly wondering whether this is a trend that is going to come and go we've seen Trends sort of come and go in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. There was times when the spider guard was a really hot guard or when Marcelo Garcia was tearing it up in the early 2000s. The butterfly guard was Very popular, you know, those things sort of came and went and then there's other things that they sort of they experienced a peak and then they decline but they still stay in the game The Butterfly guards a great example It's Not Dead by any means in fact the rise of leg lock and leg attack positions has given sort of a Resurgence to the butterfly guard because it's a really good entry for some of those bottom leg attack positions. many people very smart people have recently kind of wondered aloud if the leglock craze has reached its peak and if it's going to start declining now, I was watching the BJ Fanatics brown belt Invitational and Gordon Ryan was kind of talking aloud and it was either him or the other commentator that was with him when he was it was Todd and they were basically saying, you know, they were watching these brown belts and someone said, hey, there's not as much leg locks as I thought they would be and I think it was Gordon said well, you know, People are studying the leglock game very closely. They're learning the defenses and they're not as high percentage as they used to be. So there are certainly not going to be going away. But they are just going to become another technique that you have to do and a TCC is a great chance to sort of test that theory because if there's something that's even slightly higher percentage than everything else you can bet that these world class competitors are going to be employing it. So let's talk about some of the things that we might have observed during a a DCC and whether it's going to start something that maybe lower level competitors can take a cue from first thing. I want to talk about was the dominance of guard players and that something we talked about last week, which is a TCC really penalizes you for pulling guard. However, it does not do that in the first half of the match and I should mention while I'm thinking about it. This is something that I wasn't really I didn't make as clear as I should have in the last podcast which I said if you pull guard in a TC you're penalized but that's not really true. You are allowed to pull guard in the first part of a match. It's after the halfway point that you are penalized from pulling guard. And even there there is an exception, which is I believe in overtime if you're in any overtime, then penalties are in play right off the bat. So if you go into an overtime and you sit to guard then you will be penalized. However, in the face of all that it was fascinating to see that there were several competitors that made the calculation that despite being penalized. It was still actually a net gain for them to take a penalty sit in the guard and work their game some notable examples Paul meow took penalties and over time twice, I believe because he wanted to be in guard and it wasn't just him I know meow is you know, he's a very unique person in Brazilian jiu-jitsu with kind of a legendary guard game, but it wasn't just Tenth Planet Phenom Elvira, she said to guard a couple times believe she was injured in that match. So that makes some sensor that might justify why she did outside the rule set, but even beyond that clearly she was a bottom player and even when the matches her matches were in regulation. She was sitting to guard right away Lachlan geils, he would run to the center of the Matteson he would sit in guard and in the high percentage podcast and on the website, we've talked before about how a lot Lot of these competitions atcc is one of them are structured where it's very difficult to accrue points when you're on the bottom, but despite that these competitors have still figured that they would prefer to be on the bottom because they feel like they have the best chance of getting a submission that way. Another thing that makes this impressive is that in a TCC just like in ibjjf the only way you can score points from the bottom is to sweep. However, unlike ibjjf it's much harder to score points on a sweep in 80cc because there is I think there's the to shoulder rule which is in order for someone to be considered down. Both their shoulders have to be touching the mat. I don't think it's quite like that and ibjjf, I believe it's the three second rule and it's What it allows people to do in a TCC is you can have your butt on the ground, but if you can put your hands behind you and get your shoulders off the mat, then you're not really considered down and that makes a huge difference. So people were commenting in the the commentators booth that even to get a sweep is very challenging because you have to really wrestle to get a sweep. So all of that you would think in abstract would make someone really reluctant to play guard especially when you figured that statistically submissions. Are less likely in a DCC. However, some of the very successful competitors this weekend like Laughlin geils for them. It was no question. They sat to guard immediately and started working. So what does that mean with the meta guard players are alive and well, they're not going anywhere at the Sip that the high level at high percentage. We still recommend If you're sort of a newer competitor that you take an approach of getting on top and and pursuing positional dominance so that you can score points. However, if it's no point scenario Then by all means play guard. That's what some of the best people in the world who are doing. And what kind of guards are these players using? Well, there were two guards that really stood out in the weekend. And I remember at one point me and Roy we were on a call together because in real-time to two guys who are trying to watch three mats worth of action, and I said to him men seem like to you like you you're seeing a lot of me Shield half guard and he said absolutely so the one guard that we noticed especially in day one of the tournament was a lot of people were using these Old half guard and and this includes some of its variation. So to get really technical there's the knee shield and then there's the Z guard which is generally like a lower kind of me shield. And then one thing that I noticed with Lachlan and with Craig Jones is that they don't play a close half guard like you would think with if you were like getting a dogfight half guard where you wanted an underhook and getting a dog fight or certainly like a lockdown half guard, which is very very close. They were playing this sort of distance. Eating half guard and the reason especially for Lachlan that he was doing that was he wanted to invert from half Garden to attack like so that was a kind of guard that I really noticed that people that were trying to set up leg attacks. They like that nice Shield half guard also in the women's division. You saw particularly some of Gabby Garcia's opponents opponents were making really good use of that knee Shield, but that was for a different reason. That's because it's a good way to keep large people offer you and this is something I can personally attest to you know rooster wait until And the second big guard that we saw in maybe this was even more dominant than the knee Shield half guard was the butterfly guard. This is sort of the the Gordon Ryan's kind of go to guard lock on geils really liked the butterfly half guard and it's interesting because even within it they have some kind of different takes on it. So, you know Lachlan seemed to go like a lot more knees out. Gordon was more like knees Point towards the ceiling but one thing that Gordon consistently did and I'm not sure why he did this was a lot of times he put his his hand directly behind them and he was on his backhand or he was on his back elbow and other competitors weren't necessarily doing that with her butterfly guard and it's no surprise both Lachlan and Gordon are leg lock guys Gordon has become a lot more well-rounded but you know he's obviously really skilled at leg locks and people that like to go for leg locks should be playing butterfly guard because butterfly guard offers some really good options for getting too eggs inside are even doing inversions which a lot of people were doing this weekend This episode of the podcast is brought to you by anchor FM which is how you're hearing the high percentage podcast right now. Anchor FM is a podcast hosting service that we've been using from the beginning and it is by far the easiest most user-friendly platform for those interested in podcasting but maybe a little intimidated by the technical setup side of things.

My favorite part is just seeing people now their heads, you know, like yeah. Yeah, that's a great act.

It was a first-time experiment that went South man. Everybody's got a mom and dad right? And so they're very happy that we brought them back. So there's a there's a lot of information on there just needs to the public needs to be aware of and it could be anybody could be completely accidental.	0.0

You think I should start off with I think you know having a combination of three things of doing some type of cardio some type of dynamic stretching and static stretching combination of both and also doing a combination of compound lifting and functional things is important. So an example for you, you know would be someone more from 5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill elliptical or StairMaster do a little bit of Mobility routine loosen up your hips because you down a lot loosen up your back foam roller. Been about 15 20 minutes on that. So look about 30 minutes of warming up where your body is, like actually sweating before you do workout and the great dead great compound exercise or deadlifts just important that you keep your spine neutral and I would definitely if there's one workout that I would like you to start doing it would be dead lifts, like straightening your back straight to New York or your glutes. It's a full body workout. So you're not a lot of birds with one stone with that one movement. I just got to make sure you do it correctly and then like a lot of stability core exercises and the cardio, you know, it's not again. It's you know, it's not about intensity is just about consistency, you know, you know that you know how to track your calories. You're pretty good at that quick question.	1.0
Yeah working. Yeah, you can't do anything on your own terms. You gotta keep working keep turning down music. She's crazy. She's crazy. But let's get off of that. Let's get on some positive news J. Cole says that he wants revenge of the dreamers 3 to come out in April. They're still working on it again that whole like 10-day process which is Louis to get all of the vocals done. I presume the vocals in the production, but obviously takes a long time to make sure to get all the samples clear that they have mix and master everything. So again, it's a process. I know that you know as Fans of dreamville. I wanted you know the stuff to come out a little bit earlier when they first announced it but under their realistically I wasn't going to happen. I was trying to say like the end of February but obviously going to take a longer time in that but he was just talking to some fans the other day and he did not like directly confirm that it's going to come out in April what this is just what he is hoping that the album will come off revenge of the dreamers. Meanwhile, we've been trying to make sure they and the dreamers 3 is done and then put it on video. So the middle child videos now and of course he was at all-star weekend. He performed and participated in the in the dunk contest as well helping out not some people so it's cool man, but I'll open it. It does come out in April like he like he wanted to hopefully we don't as music fans have to wait too much longer because I already know this is gonna be some heat from the previews that we've been hearing and I know Jay ID, for example that man has been on tour going to places and The like previewing some stuff as well. So what are you expecting from this from this compilation album when it comes out flood fire.	1.0
I think like, you know, like the whole like that whole Thanos Gauntlet thing in Fortnight, even though it was very overpowered and yeah read about it. It was and it was a short period you so of fun even if you got killed in three seconds when he lets someone who's that? Oh, that's right. So if so, I wouldn't even mind if I got killed by typing in a couple seconds if I could just have the chance to like fight for	0.0

My God, it's the orc from Warcraft that he is incapable still kill. So what did you buy it? Okay, I have an idea. Mr. Mr. Newell. I have an idea. Yeah speak what if there was solo ranks, but also team-based rank in matchmaking so you can have a matchmaking, but I do miss Turner. Keep your pants on no, I'm wouldn't be sick though. I mean then it would be like because the big issue is now like we're we're sort of incentivizing Gamers to play Four frags, but the way to incentivize Gamers to play for actually in roles for teams to win is to reward teams, you know, so if you stick with the core group of five and you have a team ranked right versus an individual rank, it aligns incentives to play better Counter-Strike collectively for	1.0
Oh just being able to with the logistic sides of these kinds of races even like a nigga like a hundred K race, you know, you've got getting you know getting to a location and getting making sure you've got all your drop bags and your mandatory gear and all that.

And obviously, you know, I'm a big animal Advocate and conservationist. So it's really heartbreaking but you know, the way that the world has come together to support my home and my country And the people in the animals, there is just mind-blowing and I don't think anyone can understand how grateful we are as a nation for that support.	0.0

So if you absolutely hate doing CrossFit, but you think you should because it's trendy and everyone's doing it. You're not it's going to feel like a punishment. But if you decide that you just like biking outside and that's just your exercise and it makes you feel strong and empowered in your body and you love being outside just do that and you never have to actually do CrossFit again, and I guarantee you you will show up to that bike ride way more. Fluently than you would to that CrossFit class.	1.0

Well, I mean I started thinking about gold from one entry point of view and of course gold would be much better money then feared money that we use today, but I've come to the conclusion that as many other people before the gold is not actually the best man at their Probably something the best money would be something like silver. So I think precious metals probably the best choice. So I'm not a Bitcoin Advocate and so on and like experiments like Bitcoin because they're free market experiences is a great deal of thinking that goes into this great creativity and what I like about it as a professor is that it gets people to think about economic mechanisms or the economic Concepts and so on. So this is all great about Bitcoin, but still don't think that Bitcoin will be good money. So I think the traditional monies that we had in the past gold silver still the best one. Sorry.	0.0

Yeah, so I do have that Cameron my office but it's cool because so my grandpa always had these really cool RCA like cat, you know Tech and quote or air quotes at the time this was you know, early 90s and he would always fill my brother and I doing like riding bikes and doing these karate shows and magic show that karate shit is a sick. I want to see one of those now you don't and so bad so It was really cool because you know, he would set the camera down and then guess who gets to play with it me true. So yeah, so I was like, I always saw him with a camera and I looked up to him so much man. Like you have no idea how much I looked up to him and he kind of kind of did was that father figure for me for a while and he passed away and no one but anyways besides that he was just he was a very much an influence on my life. So I knew that he was he was successful and and his career in his field. So I kind of saw that and kind of took the leap forward as well.	1.0

He came to for like a girl he needed a girl for his music video for natural. You're his friend was like doing the rendition for him and stuff. So he's like, do you have like some kickass girl? Can I say you can take you got your good girl, you're fine saying kick ass, and there's no problem. So she's like a real contact one. She contacted me and she's like, all right, you have two days to get your act together and ship your stuff to LA and just do this music video because I remember it was right before the international Dance, World Championships.	0.0
Well, yeah then thank you for that. I you know, I'm I don't know how to respond to that. I appreciate that more than you know, don't get me wrong. I have my share of demons. My closet as well and there are people who know that I can I'm a big believer in in sharing your feelings regardless of what because that's how people get to know you. So yes, I try to be the kindest person possible and I hope that I am especially with students. I always am but let's be honest. We all have our moments right? I definitely want to wear my heart on my sleeve. That's why I have a tattoo of a heart stone on my wrist because I do but no, I really appreciate that more than you know, and and I can't take total credit for For my I guess philosophy or attitude or just believe on this subject it stemmed from well. First of all, my upbringing I was raised by the best parents in the world and completely always surrounded by Family transition that to school. I had some of the best teachers in the world. I was lucky enough to go to a very very small school. So everybody knew everybody, you know your teachers Knew by first middle and last name then your family. I was raised in a kind World, which I think a lot of people our age were and unfortunately, Times have changed like you said times are changing and times are changing in and I'm a big believer that no one was was inherently born as an unkind human being it's something you're taught. It's something that you've experienced. It's what you were surrounded by on a daily basis and my goal. Our goal is to Decatur's should be to reverse that statistics and get it back to you know, I don't know just get the world to be one happy place. I know that sounds so cliche and and cool, but Then moving forward I guess to go back into my philosophy. And reason for this stemmed from a woman who was my mentor teacher and I know I've told this story before on multiple platforms and media devices and want to hear it again.	1.0

Welcome to the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host Jake shorter. And today I am joined by Jessica Dwyer of right at home staging which is located on the sapphire Coast in New South Wales. There's a couple of things in particular probably three that I found really interesting about this interview. The first one is that just is located in her business is located in a very Regional or even rural area and I guess we talked about some of the difficulties that she faces as part of that and I know that she's not alone in that in around Australia. We also talked about The fact that the her staging business is only one of two businesses that she runs she actually has a retail physical retail store as well. So I talked a bit about how that fits in with her staging business how it complements it and also the difficulties in running two businesses at the same time. And the third one that we get into is a little bit of an online shop idea that she's had to help increase or add another revenue streams part of her staging business and in particular she has set up a dream packages. That she sells locally to various people and and I found it really interesting. And I know that she's not alone in setting up an online store as a another source of Revenue. So we kind of talked about her thoughts behind it and what she has found very successful and difficult in saying that up. She also finishes, I guess the interview with an answer to my question which I often ask but don't get a great answer which is what is something weird or unusual that you love actually has a really good answer which I actually do the same thing. Going to tell you what it is yet. You have to listen to the end to get that but I suspect its more common than we both or then she realized I think it's actually probably more common in the general population. So listen and let me know how you go with that one. Enjoy the episode. Okay, I'm joined today by just for Dwight from right at home staging. How are you going? Yes, I'm good. Thank you Jake. How are you? Very well, welcome to the show.	1.0

Yes, that retailer spending a quarter of a million dollars the first year to build that mobile application. Yes. Okay. So a brand like Cabela's or Macy's is spending at least a million dollars per app store today. Okay, using our platform. They're spending a fraction of that and so we're giving you with a single SAS fee a turnkey solution that you don't have to worry about.	1.0

Okay, so there is not that big a town. In fact, I could I think I could I could run around it probably in half an hour to an hour. So imagine you yeah, really go. I imagine that you've read every single Street in Bruner itself. So do you have it? Okay. No, I don't run in town. I've been out of town. Yeah, I don't like running around the town streets. So I like it when it's nice and quiet. So I do a lot of writing on the outskirts of town and along the dirt roads and things like that and you have a favorite course out there or do you just pick something different every day? What I am a creature of habit. I do have my few different routes that I do that my favorite. Is this the Buddha chill illegal trial, which is hardly anyone seems to know about but it's a beautiful little The trail part of the seemingly multiples went along there, but it's nice that you I never see anyone there. It's beautiful. It's undulating. You can see Mount French lie because of the distance of most of its shaded which is unusual for around here. So that would probably be my favorite I can if I start from home you can do that 30 case I suppose those trails. And then next next year I'm going to do the 200 bomb idiotic. Well, maybe the plan. Various lists the various. Wa very nice. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, beautiful try. I'm terrified about Well, I can't say I saw Iran maybe 60 or 70 case on that trail last year. And in that time I think I saw three or four snakes are quite a while snakes on that trial. But yeah, I see a lot of things here. So yeah, that doesn't yeah, but look the run like along the beaches and so on. I just yeah, 'best of Vine country. That's Show this the whole of the logistics of what bothers me the most is getting there and all sort of all that out, but there will get there and you know be an experience. That's for sure.

I think you've got to the heart of my own skepticism with relation to Keynesian economics. I think Keynes said or wrote around the time that the Great Depression started that we have urged in the management of the great machine. Yes, and I would I'm not an economist but I would argue that the in	0.0
It's all very similar. But the difference is you guys have Specialists. Sorry, there's a department specifically working or H sort of thing that we do so you have salvaged and repair unit that works with the tools and uses the helmets. Then you have an underwater bomb disposal unit. Then you have the Tactical operations team. Then you have the land-based EOD whereas we don't have as much as many people as you and so the current starters we have to do all of that. So it's an interesting but it's hard to remember a lot of stuff. So it was really cool to just come out and meet with everyone and I made lifelong friends from that trip. Any one of those guys is my best friend to this day and the water spins the opposite way, correct? Yeah, exactly. You know, I kind of fell in love with it and America has this really romantic sort of feel for Australians because we all grow up watching. It on TV and in the movies, and and so when I got the opportunity to come out here all a jumped on it and I love living out this see that's how we feel about our show you is that we have very romanticized absolutely.	1.0

Okay, so well, probably one of the most famous horses we take in the finals is is sock. Dancer Moulin Rouge sock answer, you know, we've sold this in them in the meantime while I start we started taking him. Think o 506 taught that that period of time and took him to the finals a few times 1 branca the NFR and it's the ear. He the year he won that actually I sold him to stay Smith and that you know, Moulin Rouge was a real famous horse. We took now beaver fever. She went for hacks you went from all five till last year and then we retired her beaver beaver fever with a heck of a good horse for us. And then and then in fact one of her sons went to the finals last year be verb and he went to in a foreigner bronc riding and then all raggedy Anne Capone.	1.0
These guys have been through enough. Let me just give him a high chair that you can easily wipe down and is the best thing that's ever been invented.	1.0
Well, I wouldn't say no, but I wouldn't say yes. I mean, let's face it. They're like I said the other day when we went to Sacramento it was it would like that those Bulls Bach like hell, I'm okay. And so and so when when Whenever whenever you put your Bulls up against those guys, it really lets you know, what and for me I eat it's not that it's not something I don't have investors and I don't have partners and you know, that's the only partner I have my wife and she's not very loaded so so happy so we don't for the PBR deals just different. I'm and I enjoy doing it because it's something to do. In the wintertime and and and I and I like Cody Lambert and we like Riley. We do do some other stuff with them at the American and that and their friends and that and and you know, like I said the pages and then you got new guys coming in all the time with there was some new contractors there that are pretty aggressive on putting bowls together. It did you have it's not something it's not something I can compete with, you know by looking at it though.	0.0
Yeah, probably this was Frank. This was founded the main advantage of this fact is that Switzerland so small? That's a it's a such a small. It's not even an exit door. Right? It's it's a it's a rabbit hole. Not many people get through this. All right, so Swiss franc is booty best and the problem with this Swiss is a leech bite because the Swiss this still appreciate stable money that appreciates strong money. It's just some of those sweets and industrialists. They don't like it because they see the increased pressure on that on the on the export business. The Swiss themselves. They like in Japan is different stories. Japan has the advantage so much bigger countries. So it's a much bigger economy. But the Japanese if I understand this correctly, I don't know Japanese mentality at all. But from what I see portrait you and always the media is that they are adamant desperate to create inflation. That's definitely not the case with Japan. Excuse me with was Switzerland. Therefore I would say because the it's a more sane intellectual environment moral environment.	1.0
I was only 12 and I just remember that's when it happened for me to 12. Yeah. Yeah because I used to be a casual Roman Catholic. Very passionate about God though. I always really felt I always talk about these like bedside moments that I had when I I was a little girl and I really felt a connection to the spiritual and to the Beyond. Yeah, and it wasn't until I was 12 that I went to this Born Again Church. That was Evangelical and you know now looking back I believe that's when I got really messed up and some really toxic thinking and toxic beliefs and fear fear fear fear.	1.0
No be used to buy the Krieg again ever that's it goes to price where people could practice with in real matches and they finally got good with it and put the price back up. So it's still worth buying but now like you don't want it, like people will expect to Krieg nerve to be like you just need to get basically volt this gun put it into a position where no one sees it anymore. Then the game will be fixed. So everyone can use a case. That's not what valve want and they are trying to see if there's a world where you can use both guns situationally it It'll be it'll be a bit better to have a creek but not too much that it ruins the game. Maybe the I think putting the price back up was like in general what most people thought would be a good idea. So yeah. Yeah, so I think I think it's a good idea, but that's sick and then didn't cash.	0.0

So that's something that that you might want to do. That's another one of the Scotch-Brite tools, but it's got like a long handle on it. Does it matter the brand but I'm just Just giving you an example so, you know what to look for but there's it's I think it's called a shower scrubber. I've talked about it in a different episode. But if you don't have it, you know that small dish wand will also work. I just use a different dish wand and a bathroom than in the kitchen before I got my shower scrubber.	1.0
But what I will say is that you were these picked and on ability there but my love for him. Yeah, that's fine.

Rico being more annoying than he was in this think. He's more annoying with Jackson that does make sense because he had Oliver like friendly Yeah.	1.0
Okay, so basically what they're doing this year is the Tau Chi oh and I see you and I are the newest like not the newest. Sorry Josh and I are the newest Pros but q and R are the pros that don't have celebrity Partners this year and it's because basically as people get eliminated or they usually like would go home and they would whatever this season Once you get eliminated you kind of join the pros. So like for example Brandon was eliminated with Mary now, he's joining Keo and I so it becomes more like a professional group of people like dance together and different numbers. So what we do is basically we're also hired so God forbid anyone gets hurt that day of the performance. We feel like fill in for that step if anything up. Yeah knock on wood think got everything. Okay, that's one thing. Another thing is we're going to be in every opening number q and I are actually doing the how tos this season. It's which I love you think it's	1.0
It's like better than alarm clock. Well, that's a gift that keeps on giving then that's the gift that they've given you. Pure unadulterated anger anger.	0.0
So so you're about a year out usually, you know, if and then and that's if that if you know if the stud gets her right away when you turn him in, you know, so and and you know, it is I don't know so that but I like like I said II usually March 1st is when I turned them studs out and out here in For Nia and it's always generally speaking. It's pretty nice. And and the you know, we don't know how that the sunshine in the weather and the warmth and all those things gets gets gets the mayor cycling better and and then so if everything goes right, usually I can use they start getting those mares breads are the first week or two of March and then that you know that gets me the February babies that I'm after so and then after they have their faults, how long is it until you can put them back on there? Well, so generally speaking Yeah, 45 to 60 days. All we know is cult and put them on.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah the wall running. I feel like I don't think is there were there are certain parts that I've noticed. It's like okay, here's this pipe for instance and it has this flat surface on the side of it now granted you couldn't mantle that but it's like it how long it is unlike this kind of seems like they have real running in it and they just they took it out because exact there's some parts on the map where I'm like that that is clearly a wall running wall, but for some reason it's here and it's just taken out or something. I would like it limited time event. I'll be honest. I'd like it limited time. We're like while running and All jumping we're just you know, everybody had it. You know, I feel like that would be really cool. And I mean maybe even maybe even for solos, you know, if we get solos because the main reason at least this is from the developers themselves the main reason they took it out was because it encourages people to split up but if we're doing solos we don't have to worry about splitting up it would be kind of cool to wall run.	1.0
In this would be phylogenic. Would it not in terms of Casey in terms of am I using that? All right. Yeah. It's an honor can't unlearn but I think a problem is that we need to remember also just talking behaviourally for a second it remember food is Food Water oxygen sex Jinx, of course, we both say that one believe activity. These are all unconditioned reinforcers like you are born from day one known as to teach you these things are valuable to you, right? You are born from day one saying okay. This is like this is something that I like write it maintained your behavior if you cried and you got food. Wow, I'm going to cry more. I'm going to get food again. So this happens but what we've set up is and this has been that we naturally need we've created this idea that food should be are like reinforcer for doing something like oh, yeah, I I started with my pajamas today. I went to the gym today now I get to eat right or like I starved myself six days out of the week. Now. I can go ham and put every single thing that I like could have spread out them across the entire week into one weekend or you know, and I think that like, I think that Maybe Society has also shaped the way that we look at Food whereas it should be something that is like you need. This is a human need is really I marry yeah, these are primary and unconditioned reinforcers. You need it and we're looking at it as that's our reward, right? Like how many people are like, I mean, I remember just yeah, I'm sorry. I mean not I'm sorry. I meant I'm sure you remember and yells also going to be embarrassed. I mentioned this. But your sorority days back before you were this hippie chick like you always were this girl at heart but I'm saying I remember even talking about it with you. Like how many girls would go the entire week not eating anything just so they could get super drunk on like and go. What was it Big Slice?	0.0
Yeah, really set it off in this at the start. But yeah, I've known Carly say what happens at the end. Yeah, but again, I didn't check my watch for the whole race or just going off the splits and so still getting a lot better at running it as a race. Yeah, but yes, I'm just happened to that last Caleb. I lost it and get kind of fell apart towards the end.	0.0

But when it comes to the technique, obviously, it's very difficult, right? She does a great job learning it. So there's definitely a great sense of her body awareness. She knows what she's doing.

Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank.

Yeah and like you want to talk about I do not miss that. Oh boy me neither man. So the I mean the biggest sinking feeling in the world is realizing have to Talk to the client and say hey, I lost your wedding. Sorry luckily in this case in this particular case. I was very lucky and and they were actually very very cool. And I think we saw I think we had a second camera but in no audio is like we could see it was sort of Salvage but like not really kind of my me so, okay. So anyway, so after after doing wedding videos, I'll speed this up because actually we are cruising on time the first three minutes of this was was us trying to record. Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point at least three minutes maybe I'm more than that good. Yeah, the first 42 takes so this interesting keep talking to me. So don't mind if I do it's a podcast it probably makes sense.	1.0
So by next big question is what's on the horizon for the rest of this year not with as much as any few months left. So running wise you've got the race this the black all coming up.	1.0
It's just it's not a place that a lot of people go to I don't I don't and I don't know why I think maybe it's the mentality the mentality is they see the water and they think it slows him down and it does to a certain degree because like you can't slide but it doesn't actually like physically slow you down. And maybe that's what maybe it's just this mental thing where they're like, oh, I'm going to be sloshing through the water. It's like not really I mean even some of like the tree houses because they have boxes up there to even some of the tree houses. You can get some really good loot out of there.	1.0

Yep. So you've completely broken your own rule already I get taken off fast.	1.0
Right and the Indians could prey on that because they could just say well we'll keep them. He's a perennial All-Star will keep him for two years. We don't have to trade him to you but along those lines I'm also Thinking it's only a matter of time before another team gets in the mix or is leaked to be in the mix because that just drives it up even more. You know, if the Dodgers insist they don't want to include Gavin Lux. Well, then the Indians can leak to someone and say hey we've talked to the Atlanta Braves or the Cincinnati Reds or another team about a Lindor trade and and then maybe the Dodgers get a little more desperate. But you know, I also think having just I'm Just going to completely debunk everything. I just said I also think front office's don't fall for that stuff the way we all do media fans the public, you know, I think they have a pretty good grasp of what's really going on. And yes, they do pay attention to trade rumors and and National reporters and whatnot. But you know that they use that to check on things to get what the legitimate scoop is and not necessarily what's out there. So it's going to be interesting. You're right. You know how desperate to the Dodgers get do they really feel like Gavin Lux can be as good as Francisco Lindor and more importantly do they feel like he can be as good as Lindor right now. I don't know but I mean you look up and down that roster and there's like 15 to 20 guys. I'd have interest in if I was if I were the Indians, I mean, there are so many directions they could go but you probably need Lux in the deal to feel comfortable because this isn't just this isn't just like Find the best match and let's do it. This is overwhelm us enough that we feel comfortable going to ownership and convincing them to sell their franchise face of the franchise and you know, probably sacrifice some season ticket sales and some fan sentiment knowing that hey you might be a better team and you'll certainly be a better team long-term Beyond 20/20 one. But like this is going to sting even if you get a really good return even if you quote unquote win the The trade and all the people who love to get a handout letter grades 10 seconds after a trade happens for some reason, you know, you're even if you win those and you get an A-Plus like it's still going to hurt at the Ballpark at in the ticket office. So you're going to have to be overwhelmed. That's why I think Lux probably has to be in the deal no matter what even if you to a mean like in a vacuum like Dustin may + Alex Verdugo + Chris Taylor plus Joc Pederson Plus Like Max Muncie is an amazing Hall. But like I still think I still think it's got to be Luxe. I still think you need that Marquee slam-dunk piece. And I think especially Indians fans by now are probably saying it's got to be Luxor.	1.0
Yeah. So like I said, I respect everybody who decides to go independent and you know, I know if you do sign a deal that's on you, but I just hope that you have somebody in your corner. If you yourself know that you're not going to be that business savvy and you're not gonna you know, thoroughly read every bit of whatever contracted they're trying to get you to sign. I know everybody want distribution deals and stuff, but honestly you can do you know majority that stuff yourself now as far as like that Tied me.	1.0

So you do all your dishes and then once you're done you're going to be cleaning your surfaces, I like to remove any food items, like for example, a fruit bowl a loaf of bread things like that.

Obviously that's you know, the front room on my house and at houses where I had a separate family room.

Well, you live out here. I was like, yeah, I kind of like both. Okay. Alright, you like a loli. But anyway, thank you. Good luck with everything Omar's getting out of here, but I'm still sticking around one more segment to go. Y'all know what's coming people fucking I'm bothered. When I was in high school, my mother told me she had one goal for me to make sure I made it out of high school without getting pregnant. Now. My mother had me when she was 18 years old. So she was coming from a perspective of having truly been there and done that. I like a lot of other young women. I got the usual speech about sex keep your legs closed, but she also put me on birth control pills when I Fifteen or sixteen years old. She taught me how to properly put on a condom. She talked to me very openly about sex point. Is she army with the information she felt like I needed in order to make informed decisions about my own body. Now young people in sex is always going to be a polarizing emotional topic. And so I understand why everybody lost their shit when TI who was one of my first podcast guest said during a podcast interview recently that he went to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. And when she was in high school to quote check her hymen, in other words to ensure she was still a virgin the backlash was immediate Swift severe and intense but T. I also received a lot of support from both men and women for what he said now before diving into the reaction a few things need to be cleared up in the aftermath TI and Tiny who appeared on red table talk, which is hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith and her mother they told their side of the story T. I explained that he was joking. King and embellishing he did not go to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. He explained he did accompany his daughter and Tiny to the gynecologist once and it was mostly happenstance. He said he has never been in the examination room with his daughter and when he was at the gynecologist, she welcomed his presence but here's an excerpt from that conversation on red table talk.	1.0
me but I used to pride myself so much on being self-sufficient and I don't know like it's another one of those things where I just like felt like it was a thing that you should aspire to and should be successful at and now I'm not so so sure considering like how creative and like inventive and inaccurate my brain can be so I've been talking to a certain group of friends who are also like I would say like dealing with their own emotional homework and	1.0
I don't know yet. I'll I'll have to maybe next week. I'll hint at it. I've got a few little things possibly on the burner, but I don't want to say anything on the record just yet. But yeah. Possibly something in January. So right. Okay. Yeah, but so this week's episode is a conversation we recorded with Lauren Che that correct? Yeah. All right. Yeah, so she's a good runner and she where does she live again? She lives like a good runner. She's putting a little yes the phenomena and she's crazy. Yeah, not very and again humble and and friendly and she likes my band. So the leather pleasure toys. So for those of you that are familiar with episode that was about me you'll know all about that. She listened and she's a fan and so what can I say? I'm popular No, it's yeah now right come on great chat. And so I suppose we'll just jump into this before we get into that chat before we travel on any longer. But yeah, so awesome. Yeah. Well we'll touch base again in the next episode.	1.0

You need it to look nice and you need and some of your Decor does need to be three-dimensional, you know, it's not all just pictures on the walls, but for the most part that's I decorate pictures on the walls throw pillows, maybe a plant or a framed picture on a Surface but I don't mind having a few knickknacks. And like I said, I need something in that certain space just to kind of fill it and give the room a little bit more Dimension and balance but you know definitely have a minimalist approach though.	1.0
What are you serious?	0.0
Would you like it? I totally did that.	1.0
How did that come about that came about when my son was two something happened one night when I came home from work that made me question whether growing up without a father had crept into my father Hood, which is something I never thought about, you know, because I have two other kids, you know, two daughters and so that you know, I was kicking around the idea. That year. I think I kind of rolled out some chapters and I just didn't get to it, you know, and then like a few years ago. I just like I just really need to get this out. So I started writing to explore this question. Like I did Growing Up Without a father creep into my fatherhood and you know halfway through I felt like maybe my story could be a Thule inspiration to others that have similar backgrounds. The things that nature or maybe I don't know maybe it can help. So I you know, I finished finished the book. I decided to self-publish it which is crazy not the recommended thing. But um, you know, and I put it out there and I think you know, it's really getting it was a great run to have those conversations amongst men and women but specifically amongst men within our community about fatherhood and and the responsibilities of the mail, you know, and I black families and it I actually was inspired because a lot of solid father's out there's a lot of young Brothers is you know, they they don't have all the money in the world. They might not have the highest education but then the kids lives and they're trying to make it happen.	0.0

I hope everyone's having a great day today. It's time to gear up for our big cleaning session. And if you're new to the show The Way We gear up for that is to make sure that we look presentable. Whatever that means for you freshen up a little bit. Sometimes we light a candle or turn on a wax warmer or sometimes. It's a matter of just opening a door or a window turning on some. And sliding some fresh air come through if it's a nice day. I know right now. I've got the air conditioner and the fan on so I'm not airing out my house, but I have my wax warmer plugged in.	1.0

So just like Italy underwater I don't I don't ever want to just order the water. No, I think that as soon as you bring in that number or that like external measurement of a food it inhibits your ability to actually check in with yourself and ask yourself what you feel like eating SO trading the rules about what you should be eating what you think would be a good choice and actually just start to feel into what you're craving what you feel like eating and instead of thinking about you know, how healthy this. All is or what? The calorie content is ask yourself. How do I want to feel after eating this or what value do I want to honor right now with this food decision. So really just starting to bring it to a more internal place that you're deciding for yourself what you want to eat instead of allowing some externalized message or voice tell you what you should order the next thing I would recommend for somebody who wants to start intuitive eating which is something you can do today. Is to start to get curious about the way that your body communicates with you in a unique which is unique to you. So how do you know you're hungry and what are the ways in which your body lets you know that you're hungry. How do you know when you're full and what are the cues that your body sends you to let you know that you've had enough to eat start to build awareness of these different cues so that you can build that sense of trust in your own body and you don't need to just look up what is a proper portion size for this. Food, but rather how much of this food do I actually need until I'm satisfied. And also just to start responding to your hunk like the bait the most basic intuitive eating recommendation I can make is just to honor your hunger which is another of the principles of intuitive eating. So when you feel hungry instead of like questioning yourself or asking yourself if it's okay to eat or if you can justify it in some way like what if you just gave yourself permission to eat and then you just moved on with your day and what would that change for you?	1.0
It's a tractor. No, but like the big the core of this game. This is what was so important and what I was scared of which I think is easy to fall into for a game like this is that it takes itself. So seriously, and it doesn't have the gameplay to support it. Do you know what I mean? Like here? I can't tell what's more interesting like the graphics and everything going on or the gameplay? Because if you just have Graphics it's like just eating whipped cream, you know versus like having the gameplay behind it. There's like A cake there that's enjoyable to yeah, you know what? I mean? It's like you need cake you need cake before you put on the process might like to I don't know too sweet. I couldn't think of another example. Okay. How about this? Let's rewind rewind rewind it's like having a chassis of a car but no engine, you know, like a lot of games fall into this, you know where it looks really nice and I just like Wolfenstein falls into this. I think a lot of other games I can't think of but like games like Wolfenstein basically they look so nice and they have like really cool vibe to it. But then underneath the gameplay gets repetitive and is boring but it seems like with respawn there. They always put mechanics and gameplay first and then everything is periphery which adds to it.	0.0
So like blindly following it without opening their mind to any sort of like, I don't know the only very specific scriptures, by the way, because yeah, they much like me or the pastor's I've had would quote like something really beautiful and then you read two lines down and it's like by the way, like slavery is should be honored and you're like wait what people that's what's so funny because I recently did a video about gay marriage as well and I was responsible.	0.0
Now that's the yeah, that's that's confusing. I mean cuz it's almost like a Titanfall 2 situation. But now it's Battlefield that's Battlefield has turned into the TitanFall 2 of the of 2019 because it's like who's going to be playing. I mean, I'm sure there's millions of people who picked up Battlefield 5 and they might even still have it on their fan base for sure.	0.0
Did he ever tell you that or share that with you know, honestly, like I just remember on the show because there's just so many people in the show and I can't blame him like he sees so many act today and like, oh the qualifiers are there laws overwhelming. Yeah. It's so overwhelming, so I'm not Expecting him to like remember every performance we do or everyone does but I do remember on the show. He did say that what he called me called me a good zeiger a tiger mix with a gazelle.	1.0

And so that's what stop trying to put a round Peg. Us into a square hole, you know when that was a big thing with everyone all of the couples that I spoke to they all said we spoke the vision. We made it clear. Hey, this is the guy especially hey, this is what I'm called to do. Are you willing to go with me? I'm not trying to like, oh this one. I think it can work. I was in a personally I was in a relationship back in the day that I was like trying to figure it out like oh, you know, this person's not exactly what I thought when I mentioned Ministry, they like froze like a deer in headlights, but I think we could make it work, you know like Like you need it if you're called to go into full-time Ministry. You shouldn't be looking for someone who's like who doesn't wanna have anything to do with it. I just want to stay home with the kids someone who's like I've talked about before someone who's like working for the weekend, you know, I just love to travel. I love going on vacation. You need someone who's like willing to work like there's a mission at hand. Adam didn't get Eve so she could like spend all his money and take them on vacation. So you could take on vacation like there needs to be a purpose behind your marriage. Even if it isn't Ministry if it's like, hey, we're We're Kingdom Minded people and that's the whole purpose of this podcast is like get you to be Kingdom Minded like your life isn't get an education get a good job retire at 65 and enjoy life as much as you can. That's not the gospel. The gospel isn't enjoy life. The gospel is take up your cross and follow Jesus like your life on this Earth, you're gaining treasure in heaven. You're going to spend eternity and treasure and maybe if you're lucky a hundred years on this earth like at a hundred and eight years at I tried hundred and twenty years at Max but our life here on Earth is is short. This is a time of sowing and reaping for eternity that you are making choices now. And so your marriage should be geared in that direction. We one of the things that was said and I'll go over some of the Practical boundaries, but they said that they didn't want to be always on the defensive so they had clear boundaries. Hey, we're not going in the house together by ourselves. We're never going the bedroom together. Even if there are people in the house there were some practical things. You know, I think I think you shouldn't be making out with somebody like full-on like making out with somebody before you're married. I think you know, it's crazy. It's 2019. It's normal in this day and age even by Christian standards like it's cool to fool around a little bit like but draw the line for yourselves everyone that I talk to and these are people that I look at and say they have a they have a good marriage. They all said, you know, we had clear lines and if any of them said hey, what do you if you could do things differently it was hey, I wish we had drawn more. Clear lines. I wish it had been clear. I wish we would have I wish we would have I was I wish the boundaries would have been better. No one said, you know, I think our boundaries were too strict.	0.0

So yeah, so I started a job as a editor for one of the local TV station to CBS affiliate here in sorry. No the ABC affiliate here in Salt Lake and I went to the CBS affiliate here in Salt Lake won an Emmy was some of the with a piece that I did that at some point. I'll put a link out there. So you guys can all see it and at that point I realized I'm like, you know, what I've had enough of news could probably actually also do an entire episode on what it's like working in local TV station. I think we could probably we could probably find a really good guest to come on to talk about any cool. All sorts of people, that'd be interesting. That would be a good one news is a particularly rough filled and so once I had made a five-year plan at that point to once I was in news, I'm like, okay, I'm new to this and it is I'm going to get an Emmy. I'm going to get out and because I knew that Amy could help give me other jobs and it has which it has which was the next job which is doing video production for a marketing company, which is actually where Drew and I met I still work there currently do some freelance as well on the side and thinking about what does the future look like for me? Right? Very cool.	1.0

Well those profound thank you. That really was that changed like that. I've been thinking about that later time again. I'm not always an upstanding citizen the other day saw kid wearing a trump shirt went up to him and said hey asshole dumb fucking shirt, and then I walked away. So like I am not always tolerant like that's that's not to say I'm always a fucking piece love ya person. Like I have my mole of unity respect. Yeah, you know Fleur Fleur life, baby. They'd always the case. But I try as hard as I can and that's all you can do. That's all you can do and again like that comes back to like kind of what I was talking about are just being kind to yourself. You know, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall back. It's okay, but if you're mean to yourself, you're going to sink down deeper into it. So what I used to do when I was in high school. Yeah. I know I'd be like, yeah, I fucking suck. Ooh, I'm going to go do this and then feel worse about myself and be like Oh, my life sucks. I'm like, yeah. Yeah for me. Yeah for me then your victim card gets maxed out and you're like I need to make some changes definitely, you know, there comes a point when you're just like damn it really be all me not all you but like well, no, it didn't a its. It says I don't know. It's just your responsibility to take care of it, but it's not your fault. No exactly. Yeah, because like you it's not your fault that your brain isn't firing neurons correctly and like you don't have enough chemicals. Of Serotonin or dopamine? You can't regulate go green like it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with it a hundred percent. Yeah, because you know, you don't want to be you don't want to be kind of putting out more sadness into the world if that makes sense. Yeah, if humans don't have a way out like if a cell doesn't have a way out it will die. Yeah, like it doesn't have any pores. Yeah, it will like become full of its own waste and die and that's like people if they don't have any Outlets they become I'm full of negativity and they can't Thrive. Yeah, you know really? Well that's where made up ourselves. Yeah, exactly. And so it's like just making those channels to connect with things that you really love isn't really important because if you get in the flow state where you're like, I'm forgetting that time is a thing. I'm forgetting about everything else like when you paint or like stuff like that like that's when You're happy. Yeah when you're going out, yeah, not even happy but just like it was kind of music and yeah concerts and dancing or after something you forget or moshing for a while pockets are the best or they make you remember when they play that one song. Yeah. It's remember that memory and just cried out. Yeah, that's so true. Yeah. A depression is a bitch it can make you think a lot of things that aren't true, but just know that. Your thoughts aren't always real and just note that even though it does not seem like it you have the ability to overcome it. Yeah, it's in you it's in all of it's not gonna happen overnight. Hmm definitely but it can get better and it does get better like speaking as someone in high school who's always thinking about dying. Yeah now I'm 22 almost I don't think about die every day definitely. It's good. Yeah, and if you obviously like this goes without saying almost like if you're feeling these negative thoughts like please tell someone like people want to hear it people would rather hear you complain then hear about you dying a hundred percent. So like there's outlets for that too. Like there's support groups. Like there's so many things you can try like so many things you can try and it's not like It's not like one thing it's not like maybe one thing is going to fix you. Like it's going to be a bunch of different things that you use in your little toolbox exactly to get better. So find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia your straight.

Okay in that Netflix subscription is enough for me. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, you know that might have been what it was because I was never around like a liberal Christians. It was the very extreme. Evangelical fundamentalist and I didn't know that that was like a small sect of Christianity like even recently I just thought that that was normal Christianity and I was like, you know always made to feel like, you know, any type of disagreement was just you're not being a real Christian. You're not being a good Christian. But yeah from the very beginning it was just like this constant theme of Of like you think your life is good now, but it can be so much better like is if you believe in Jesus like you will be like infinitely better. And yeah, it's funny like you mentioned the bedside moments because I still like so vividly remember sitting in my bed one morning when I was 12, and I was praying to God and attempting to repent for my sins, but I just kept saying Did I didn't know what I had done wrong? Like I didn't understand why I was so unworthy and undeserving of his love. I didn't like feel like I was the sinful person that was filled with like the innate evil of Adam and Eve like that. They let into this world. But like that's what I was reading. And that's what I believe like it was the inspired word of God. I thought it was true and all the worship songs in youth group and stuff just kept saying like I want more of you God and less of me and it just kind of like shrunk. I'd like shrunk myself down and felt like I must have been doing something wrong in his eyes and like for that I was truly sorry and you know begged for his forgiveness. And I don't know it was just like this constant theme of know your place like you are inferior by Design and I didn't realize it back then but that was like when my healthy amount of self-worth started to Chip Away And it was like crazy that that was like the moment that I dedicated my life to Christ. Yeah, and then like for 10 years after that Christianity kind of consumed my life my friend group. We would have liked deep discussions all the time. I would go to youth group devotional groups summer school, like summer camps Bible studies. I was a youth leader for a while. And it was just a very like simple Faith but I was always told that you're not supposed to intellectualize your face or critically think too much about it. And I kind of feel like not teaching apologetics is like doing a disservice to your congregation because you know people might hear about these things eventually and then I mean that's like what happened to me in my last semester of college after You know, I was 22 so it had been 10 years. My roommate was a religious studies minor and she was doing all of this research for her classes. And you know, she was having like people that were on the committee of translating the ancient Greek manuscripts like as her teacher and they were telling her these things that I just knew nothing about and it was that same sort of feeling I had when I was 12, it was like wow, like I'm so ignorant like there's so much more. I need to know. And so I that's when I like started my deep study of Theology and I went into it as a Christian wanting to be a better Christian thinking that I was going to like, you know be so solid in my faith and then just as I continue down that path like things slowly started to like not make sense with like the Christian doctrine and my faith was like unraveling I guess in my questions. We're too hard and Too Deep for the Christians around me to answer I guess so I was kind of on my own and I yeah, I decided that like I just didn't think the facts were there. But honestly the damaging part came like after I left like once I just decided I don't think this is true. I don't think I'm going to call myself a Christian anymore. That's when I started like feeling the damaging effects of like what? It happened like the past 10 years, basically.	0.0
No, I wouldn't say it was any pressure because again, you you have to work with the opportunities that come your way I think for me a little further down where in my career and not to fast forward that far but I think that's why house was such a significant move because at that point I was like yo, I got to do something to break out of this mold or if you want to call it that I just knew I had to do something that they do not see coming and nobody saw that coming you CER that way not really, okay only because I was only 14 So and I knew it wasn't you know, it was gonna have that lasting thing. It was a cool little pop up. But I mean it was a cool little pop. It was a biggest show on television, but because I wasn't like entrenched in fashion. It it really didn't hit me that way, you know, but that for me that I was making that move to do house was a great move.	1.0

Yeah. Well and I think that I usually think comments are they make me laugh and I actually really enjoy talking to haters like yeah, you know the sweet-looking, you know young person just wrote something like well you're sending everyone to hell and you're going to hell yourself. And yeah, I just like called her out. and was like hey, why do you believe that like, do you know that I'm a person and you're saying that to me on the internet and that's like actually such a terrible thing to say to somebody and a lot of them apologize because it's not about me convincing them that my way of thinking is right, but it's more about the more defensive you are and lieu of actually being an empath and listening and like allowing people to On their own Journeys with patience and love instead of always trying to like get everyone onto your team. The more effective you are just as a human being in general, but especially as a Christian, I don't understand what church is telling people that's emboldening them to go online screaming about someone else going to hell like that's yeah. Jesus was not walking around Jerusalem screaming about hell. Yeah, so I'm like, where where did you guys even get that from and what? What scripture is that the way you're supposed to be handling people that you disagree with?	0.0
Did you play how much traveling are we going to do? How do you decide playing time? What uniforms are we getting? Can you give my daughter a ride when our practice is going to be? How do you think will do this year? Try to address as many of these questions as you can in your introduction to the team the fewer questions. There are the quicker everyone will get out of the meeting which busy parents appreciate additionally. If you answer some of these questions up front like how long have you been coaching? It will feel less like you're hiding things and you will see much more confident and trustworthy do your research have your ducks in a row and lay it all out on the table a sample introduction for a first-year coach could sound like this. Hello everyone. My name is Whitney Bartok. And this is my first year coaching volleyball. Although I'm new to coaching. I started playing volleyball when I was in sixth grade and have been playing ever since while in high school. I worked at every summer camp and even LED Camp my senior year. What I loved about coaching during Camp was seeing the girls develop their skills and watching their enthusiasm for the Game grow. Although it's my first year coaching. I know that this program has been very successful in the past. I plan to build on those successes with an aggressive playing style which still develops the Er Team you should then go over team rules which is detailed in subsequent sections established travel plans the possibility for any additional travel uniform ordering if not already in place practice schedules and team policies. Once your presentation is done open the floor for questions. You should have addressed most of the topics which apply to everyone so you may get individual questions at this point note that you can discuss individual questions afterwards, so the group can be dismissed. If you do not already have it have sheets, which families can complete and pass around at the meeting for contact information follow the meeting up with an email summarizing your points and reiterating any questions, which you answer during the meeting one final note. Although I often refer to family members as parents throughout these Pages Please be aware that sometimes you may be communicating with Aunts Uncles grandparents legal Guardians step parents cousins. The list goes on and on I And being inclusive in your speech because not everyone will have a mom and dad as their primary support system. I prefer to use the term family as often as possible since this has always captured everyone who is a legal guardian for my girls. So despite my use of the term parents on occasion. Please note the family structure for your players before you say anything which exclude someone who cares for one of your girls more paperwork. I know I know you thought you were done with paperwork, but I have good news for you.	1.0

She like yo, we want our own, you know, say we want our own Manager and stuff like that.

So We think that we have we tend to think that weight is something that we have a lot of control over and that we can change our weight at any point that we decide to and that and anybody who's been on a diet before knows that that's not actually it's not actually that simple. It's not like you just do the diet you lose weight and then you never look back. In fact, you know what tends to happen as soon as you go off the diet if either of you like feel comfortable here, whoop, you gain it all back.	1.0

So he was like a year and a half old. She was born into June 2009. Okay, it's this handprint and there's like Little Snowmen and oh my gosh, it's a glass ornament is my favorite ornament because it can't be replaced. Right? So I like I double box it when I put it away and I store it and when I take it out, I put it high up on the tree. So none of my other kids can touch it. Like I love this ornament it if it breaks All Is Lost right? So I finally took down the tree after New Year, but I first took all the ornaments off because I really just wanted to get the tree like out so I took the ornaments off I put him in a little pile. I took the tree down. I like swept and stuff and all of a sudden it was like boom. My Deegan was awake. My two-year-old like things got crazy. My husband came home. Home at the same time and I had to go take a meal to a friend because she had just had a baby that was in the hospital. All right, whatever. So I'm like, oh my gosh, babe. I have to go take this meal. And so while you're watching football, can you just like start putting away those ornaments boom? I was out right? I should have put away and I the first thing I thought to was like you should probably put that ornament away ever, but I was like nah, that's fine. Right dumb because my two-year-old and a four-year-old were up. Round I should have known I should have known and I was like the Lord told me you need to put that ornament away, right?

So so so for four years ago, I decided to leave my my career at a management consulting firm to start sandbox Commerce. So my friend said what the hell are you doing? I had a pretty comfortable potential. It is stay there for the next 20 years for the next 20 years, but I kind of already saw the glass ceiling so I could tell that you know, my limit my options were limited working for that for that company so I decided all right, so Sterling's a little rocky out of the gate, but the story he sharing is your classic entrepreneurial Journey.	1.0

I know you guys said something along the lines of like you don't have to like beat somebody you're in different races like the concept of kind of like you don't have to bring someone else down just to like succeed and I think that like, We need to continue that like culture around like bring other women up. Don't tear them down.

You know, you don't want to Buck him right up to the end. But but like a good example of For a how our system earlier in the conversation I mentioned how I learned a lot from Ike's Anki and one of the things that I learned from Mike was with breeding young mares and then breeding your business. Let's face it guys. It's if you don't breed your best mares, you're not going to have good Colts. You're gonna have mediocre cult. So you gotta break your best married.	0.0

You know, I think that Doing things at an extreme measure like trying to do everything all at once can be paralyzing. Let's say like it's decision paralysis when you tell somebody I want you to do an hour of cardio a day. I want you to count your calories. I want you have this much water. I want you to sleep this wedge apple cider vinegar. I want you to have 30 25 to 35 grams of fiber at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you throw too much shot them they kind of get like get stuck it in there. Yeah, so I try to give them a smart goals something that's specific something that's measurable. All something that's realistic attainable the timely and example of a smart goal is I want you to lose four pounds in four weeks. I want you to track your water intake. I want you to track your way and every single day and then at the end of each week take the average of your weight and the compared to the next and to the next so it's like once I hear yeah, you're not you're not looking day-to-day measurements. You're looking at weekly measurements and on average. So you get a general idea of where your weight is. Actually that's kind of like stocks, you know goes up it goes down. But where is the general Trend going, you know? A lot of fluctuations that people have our water weight fluctuations. You have salt you have sugar you have alcohol you have menstruation. You have stress. You have sleep. You have so many things fiber that affect your water weight at that particular point. So it's important to take your weigh-ins average them out compared to the next week. So you get a general idea. Am I really losing weight and my maintaining what's the rate at my loser? Because you can lose the to 3 pounds a day go in the sauna cut your car. Yeah, you know eat clean and that's just a lot of water weight. Illusion, but if you're talking about fat loss fat loss takes time. Yeah about 1 pound per week. Gotcha.	0.0
Absolutely. So we're going to get. After Sterling leaves the room the investors debrief. He was awesome. He was so hard to say you only anything but yes to I mean I can see I can find people for his company right now. I know great salesperson for his company.

I haven't heard his name, but I'm assuming he's gone by this point. So Garrett Bradbury would be fantastic selection at 30 or 40 for same thing with The other Center I can't members name.

Are we still don't know who's With who and then finally we found out and we were on cloud nine. It was just the best feeling ever and it's so great because right away like even at the meet and greet we had a great chemistry together good and it's so funny because there was like a picture for the Good Morning America cast and we happen to be standing all three of us next to each other like partial.

Well, it's see I would have been 2012. I sold a horse. Pony man, he belongs to stay Smith now and he was he was out of that cult crop, you know, and then there was you know, he was by far the shiniest one. I mean, I guess I sold him to stay. I'm pretty sure it was 2012. He bought him there at the Benny Binion sailed, you know the bucking horse or a bucking horse security actually stays puts it on and and yeah, so Smith, I'd buck that colt there and Smith. Bought him and I think he's been to the NFR every year since like, oh, well, yeah, he's he was the shiniest one by far and then oh, I have a few other ones that are just really nice horses, you know that route. And so I think that first whole crop, but probably had well I'm going to say I can't I don't recall but I'm gonna say between 15 and 20 Colts to start with and I'm about I have when do you start those horses? I'm sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Wendy's start those horses, you know, how long is it before you start to know if you made the right breeding decision? Oh, well, sometimes a level five years, but for that particular to answer your question directly, the first part of the question was, you know, when do we start a I start dummy are blocking the Colts when they're too and and and I just dummy buckham once when they're to unless they just flat run off if they just flat run off. Then on my block him again, you know and do something a little bit different just but I bought them wants when they're two or twice. Like I said and then same when there's three and then so then when therefore I get people on them, you know, they start with their Riders. So a lot of them a lot of them horses have anywhere from two three, maybe four trips by the time they're four year olds, and then then it's time for a rider and and sometimes you know, they They you know, if you can see that they're pretty sure of their feet and their they have a really controlled style and they're you know, they're when I say a controlled style, you know, like the akkad. I got a pattern and they're like I said their feet are running room and all that's going on good and I feel confident. I'll stay up and not fall down with the guy. So I'll go ahead and put a guy on him with a couple of dummy trips and then and then the other ones, you know, there's those horses that I've Listen, I hate to admit it but there's horses. I've raised it. It took six or eight trips to before I felt confident to put a guy on it because it was all down all of ya and and generally that's the wild or wasn't it and going back to the breeding. That's when they're bred wrong. They're too wild and you know bucking horses. Sometimes the the Layman fan gives bucking horses a bad rap like they're there and I shouldn't that sounds wrong. I got I wish I could I was better with my words, but They get kind of a bad rap like her wild and yeah, you guys know that's that's not the case at all. Some of these some of these horses are really gentle and really good to be around and and and generally speaking is the more quiet they learn calm. They learned Focus. They are the better bucking horses. They are they you know, they don't have to be Wild Buck. We all know that what a maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not a bucking horse guy got on some back in the day and never never did any good at it? Didn't ever understand it but aside from just sighs. How do you how do you choose which which event you want to Buck those horses a cracker or saddle bro? Yes. That's a really good question for me. First of all, you're going to see when you dummy block them kind of what they do with their head. And when I was talking a minute ago about the control their body control while there while they're bucking with just a dummy on that gives you a little bit of an indication of what event to do to put them in. in butt butt For me, I found more of their mother. So if their mother could take the bronc riding and tolerated it and she liked it and bucks in it. The Colts in seems to do that, you know, tools will follow suit now that's not always the case but a lot of the time it is, you know, an in an unfortunately the way as the way the rodeo business is now with the shorts. Age of bareback Riders, sometimes you are forced to put Colts in the bronc riding that you're not 100% sure if it's going to work or not when you're first blocking them around but sometimes there's it works out beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't but for the most part you kind of got a number one go with their style number two kind of their mom and then third the availability of the riders that are there that day you have very many of those horses that you may be starting. In one event and then decide that they need to go to the other event, or maybe they do both events or oh absolutely. So so I have a horse named Capone and he's been in a far five times. I think or maybe six and his mom is out of one of our famous men as Raggedy Ann. Well when I first started bucking Capone, he was a bare back and he went to the finals like for three or four times and bareback, you know in the bareback riding.	1.0

Yeah, it was crazy. Well like my whole experience with Christianity stemmed from my friend group. Like I wasn't raised a Christian I was raised and like just a very loving secular home and religion wasn't talked about and so, you know actually like First experience with Christianity happened when I was 12 years old. I was in my seventh grade science class and we were learning about Evolution exempt these two girls got so mad and they were like, what about Adam and Eve? What about the Garden of Eden? Like how can you be teaching this stuff in a public school? Like they were so mad and I was like, who are you talking about? Like who's Adam? Who is Eve? Like I didn't I was so ignorant. Ignorant and so I think at that point I kind of like became their salvation project and I was starting from like a blank slate like I didn't know anything about religion really and so I kind of just accepted that what they were saying was true and my parents never wanted to tell me like what to believe or what not to believe but that kind of lead to like an unhealthy. Like one-sided argument that was like filling my brain coming from my friends and I didn't like I don't know. I didn't necessarily critically think too much about it.	0.0

No, it's the other way around. I think that people in power I interested in spending a lot of money. Yeah. Okay. So they're using they looking for justifications of their own activities. They want to know why is it good what they're doing they want to do anyway see and so why they should text more and why they should they be put into place a monetary. Student that allows for the at-will libitum creation of money and here comes canes and he's not the only one who's one of them and explains them why this is a good thing. So therefore I think they'd hire people of this sword there are constructive. So say if you've got this kind of comments off my back when you apply through you make up a research by for research and and so on and say, okay, so where is this? He's leading us right what kind of policy can we justify with this or help help ameliorate and so on if you say well I probably this doesn't justify anything it if it goes anywhere it probably rather leads to criticizing the whole point of intervening in the first place.

Like, what's got you entry what's got you peaked right now really interested to see, you know, we get asked all the time. When as the recession coming in we were on the largest expansion Area Cycle from a building. Environment standpoint that we've ever been on in kind of recorded history. And so everyone's waiting for the other shoe to drop and for there to be some sort of Market pull back, but barring any sort of mega event. We don't see a giant monolithic downward shift in the construction industry happening like in 2008 where the music just stopped overnight. We do see pockets of the industry from a sector level and a geographic level that will begin softening, you know at different rates. I'm going to different times but I'm most interested to see how contractors react to that change and markets and I think contractors this time around have been more sobered and more cautious and maybe more paranoid than contractors were in a seven and a way where if you flash back to 2007 times were good. There wasn't a lot of people that were scared of a downturn and then boom all of a sudden. We were caught in a new reality. I think you flash forward to today and it's almost the opposite mentality that we see in the marketplace where as people are constantly paranoid about when the market is going to ship that they're thinking about today how to prepare their Organization for living in a different tomorrow is so so we have we have a lot more confidence. I would say from a broad sense that the contractor Market is much more prepared to deal with a recession than they were in. Seven or at least they thought about it and planned about it more now. It's still probably be painful for some but I think the construction in secret could probably use a slight pullback for the amount of stress that's out there right now on labor markets for my stress. It's on contractor balance sheets currently as they're trying to execute all this work slight cooling off period although I don't never with the recession on on any industry or any economy a slight cooling off period could actually be a chance. Or the construction industry in North America to catch its breath.	0.0

Yeah. So yeah. So once I got out of the military I came to Utah my parents live in Utah and it just again not super internet e days and so and I guess I didn't feel very good. It was strange even having been in the military and having gone some of the places that I went, you know, Kuwait and strange places. I still had kind of a problem feeling like I could just go like to LA. And live by myself and go to college they're like, I didn't feel comfortable with that partially because I was married at the time and I know for me I would've been fine being broke sleeping in a gutter going to college in LA, but I was married and so I had somebody else I needed to take into consideration. And so I felt like I couldn't like drag her along to do the same sort of thing. And so the kind of the compromise I think was moving to Utah to Salt Lake where my parents lived and go into the University of Utah has actually had from all from everything. I'd heard a pretty decent little film program moving from Idaho, right? No, so I was in England. Oh God. Yeah. So yeah grew up in Idaho. But then when doing military like left, Idaho and never looked back and and so I was yeah, I was stationed in England for most of the time I was in the in the Air Force and so it's moving back from England back to Utah which I like I did take the short route from Idaho to Utah for sure anyway, but yeah, it kind of took the long way around and so yeah, like I decided I'm like I'm gonna go to film school and you know, like I think Film school is definitely a conversation that could be had another day. Is it worth it? You know, there's a lot there's been a lot of talk about that like, you know, sometimes people say the best film school is just you know doing it, you know, and like I actually don't disagree with that especially in today's world. Yeah, especially today's world is when there's so much online you can read about like there's basically just textbooks online you could you have access to like every movie ever made like you can do a bit of self film school and like equipment like honestly, you know phones, you know, you can grab a phone. It's got a camera on it you can Start you can start doing stuff much easier than you could back when I started in school. There's more content and filmmaking today than there has been ever ever actually seen as such a crowded like this is the stuff I want to do stuff as a kid and like part of me wishes.

Let me take over take a break and I jump in the water in a black wetsuit a pair of black fins, and I'm on the surface on my back. Just moving from point A to point B, and I look over my left shoulder to make sure that I'm still headed towards the bow of the warship that I'm supposed to be attacking and before I can turn back I You have a huge whack in my leg and it didn't really hurt but it just kind of shocked me and I turned around to look and there's just a massive shock head touching me and takes me feels like seconds to work out what's going on because I've never even seen a shock and all of a sudden is this, you know, it's like Shark Week has come to life in front of me while I'm swimming and I don't really know what to do.

I've seen the crocodile hunter. I've seen Shark Week over our job it in the eyeball. So I tried but I can't move my arm and I looked down and I can see the teeth embedded into my wrist and every time I try and pull it I can see the flesh tearing I was so I think nothing left hand I go to the eyeball with my left and I reach over but I can't reach it and in short side grab it by the nose and try to push it off, but that Is the type of the lower jaw deeper into the back of my leg. So I cut back to try and punch it in the nose and by that stage the Sharks decided on food and starts to shake me and that's when the paint kicks in like a hundred teeth razor-sharp teeth on either side of your limb moving in unison to tear through your flash and all of the fight went out of them took me under water and I was just yelling and I was in agony and we popped up and I took it. Breath and then it took me back under and just kept thrashing me around like a rag doll and I realized how powerful it was nothing I could do and so I realized that I was going to die and I remember thinking to myself. I'm not going home today. I'm going to die right now and it was strange because it wasn't like times flow down. I think our bodies and our minds are such incredible machines and my mind went into hyperdrive and I started running. My life is hanging. Okay, am I ready to die and I thought well shit no coming from where I started out as a really lost and bad kids self-harming and drugs and all that stuff and fighting and stealing to where I had achieved Peace Keeping with the UN and the elite of the Navy and all that sort of stuff and I thought you know what I'll come further than I've ever thought possible if I'm going to die now I have no regrets. I'm ready to go. And so I let go and I was ready to drift away and the A shark at that point ripped through the rest of my leg and took my hand off and because it wasn't attached to me anymore. My wet suit made me boy and I'll pop to the surface and I realized that I wasn't dead and I thought shit. I got to get out of here before it comes back and I saw my safety boat with my three teammates in and I start to swim to the safety boat. But as soon as I take a stroke, I can see my hands gone. It just my arm ends at the end of my wetsuit and my medical training kicks in and I think I've got to keep that wound above my heart to stem the bleeding. So I've got one out of the water swim back to the boat with one hand and one leg because I can't even feel my right leg. I don't know what's wrong with it at this point. I just can't feel it. And the guys in the safety boat said I was literally swimming through a pool of my own blood and they said when they came in closer, he was actually so stick they could taste it in the air and I just I didn't think I was going to make it. I thought there's so much blood in the water sharks will come back and other sharks going to smell it and I'm going to die. I'm just waiting for a shock to grab me. By the other leg and it just never came so I just kept swimming back to the boat and eventually the guys got to me pulled me out of the water and just out of the sheer relief of not being eaten any more. I relax my eyes rolled back in my head and I pass out and my mate almost brings into action and his training tells him. I'm going into cardiac arrest and he needs to stimulate my heart. So he straddles me and he starts pummeling me in the chest. I'm trying to wake me back up and and it work. And I wake up and I look over and my hands gone freshly bitten off by a shark and I look up and tell me who's beating the shit out of me and I just think today sucks.	0.0

And of course anchor which houses everything that you hear here and we appreciate all of the support and we hope that you all continue supporting us in the Future Let's go ahead and get into the notable new releases. Now we were talking about last episode that we were kind of disappointed because it hasn't really been any music coming out but last week we did get a healthy dose of music. So let's go ahead and go over the new releases 2 Chainz brought out his new project called rapper go to the league, which you had LeBron being a are for which I found that very strange, you know, it's a lot of controversy behind that because they were saying that he did not go to some games or he I'll just just to work on the album, but that's neither here nor there. It was very interesting to change took him onto to be in a are so and he said like this wasn't only project he had them like work on another project to so we'll see what comes through with that but it was a decent album. I listened to it on Friday when it dropped T-Pain Shawty pain because I don't know you probably don't watch it. But I know my girl religiously watch The Masked Singer where they had a whole bunch of whole bunch of Artists and athletes and everything you can name of entertainers dress up in Crazy suits and singing and then, you know, they get voted off of what night and T-Pain want it all and she got me into watching it and I was like, yeah, I was like I can tell his accent. I know that that's t-paint right there and the judge just weren't getting it but he ended up winning everything and if the funny thing ironically though, I would say coincidentally, I won't say ironically coincidentally his New project called wind up drop like the same week that he would so now everybody everybody is thinking that it was just a roll out. This is just to get people to listen to his music. But what did he case his new project called one up that came out like in the middle of the week didn't come out Friday, but go and listen to that Solange. She has been bringing like a lot of visuals and everything and people were like what's going on like she was even like posting a Pedro BlackPlanet people like this Black Planet back. So like right? Yeah, so it was kind of weird it everybody would kind of like speculating what was going on but turns out she has a new project. So she was just doing a lot of promotion for that. So her new project is called when I get home you can go and listen to that little Skies dropped Shelby. I think that this is his second official Studio project from not mistaken. I don't know if we have any little Skies fans that the listen to us, but I believe this is the second official Studio project. So going to listen that if you're a little Skies fan and finally the baby I just get so confused because there's there there's now a saturation of babies out there. We got a little baby then we got double baby. So it's very confusing at times. I like who the hell is is but he's a North Carolina native their child in North Carolina and he dropped his new project called Baby on baby. So very interesting title for a project but those are the notable new releases for the week of March 1st currently its March forth as we're recording. Adding this but these are all the release that came out the week of March 1st. So let's get into the music news. First knew that we have here is Tyrese. Mr. Tyrese is slated to play Teddy Pendergrass and the biopic Now by all pigs have become like very very popular. I think that more and more people were seeing like that. People are very very interested to see some of these stories from the people. You may not know much about you like the inside scoop go through everything that Of that they have been to in their lives and I don't care how many people clown Tyrese I think that he's a good singer. I think that he's a good actor as well. I know he did get called The Fast and Furious stuff, but I mean that's where he made all the bread as I ain't mad and forgetting all their bread and stink it up stick it with the series as long as he did, but Tyrese obviously has been in other movies as well. Like baby voice is probably where everybody remembers him from but he said that Teddy Pendergrass actually asked him to tell his story before you passed away. Not a one thing that I've always. Always had a problem with that. I had an issue with it when it comes to biopics it when you don't actually ask anybody who was around the person or you don't ask the person himself. If you're just going to like make us up as she go that's not a good biopic in my case. But in this particular case with Teddy Pendergrass, he actually is going to have Joan Pendergrass which is Teddy Pendergrass his widow Teddy Pendergrass. By the way. He passed away in 2010. And he's going to have little Marvin is going to come on and write the screenplay and this is all supposed to be Do this by Lee Daniels which pretty much as his hands and everything, so I'm not surprised that Lee Daniels it's going to do this but this biopic but I thought this was interesting though. We have no date as to when it's going to come out. But this is this is all the news that we have so far. So, how do you feel about Tyrese playing Teddy Pendergrass antibiotic?	0.0

Okay, but the fact is is that I think you have something truly special in yourself and I see it and I want to be a part of this and so let's take the next step. So right I can't commit a dollar sign until I really do a little bit more due diligence. I'm going to hook you up with Jake up in the next couple of days and why don't we carry on that conversation as that is	0.0
Hi, this is Mary HK, Troy and you're listening to Hey, cool life a micro pot about mental health and creativity. Hmm. It is January the 23rd 2019 and this is episode 22 in reality. It is actually the evening of the 22nd. But um I'm a very early morning tomorrow. So I am trying to record it tonight and seeing how it goes. I've already done that thing where I fussed too much and premeditated too much. So I've tried recording it once before and I didn't like the results and I was having this Stern conversation with myself being like the whole agreement was that you Just deliver the first Pancake no matter how misshapen and raw the dough but then the sort of staunch like determination with which I refuse to let myself even like mess with it felt really ungentle.	0.0

So we put away the clean dishes and then it's time to either load the dishwasher or start a sink and when I talk about starting a sink load of dishes, I'm assuming that you fill up the sink with hot. Soapy water, but I realize that some people don't do that. I was watching a little video on Pinterest earlier because I try to to read a lot of cleaning articles and cleaning videos and things to kind of get ideas for the show and make sure that I'm covering everything and that, you know, I'm staying with the trends and it was a video of hacks where they showed like a little holder for your sponge and just some different things to make doing dishes easier. But what I noticed is that they were washing the each dish just in one step.	1.0
Yeah, which was terrible. We saw it and I thought like it was some some your dad that put it up and everyone was just getting smashed on super box. I'll go to here who's had one Supermarket told are going I searched pitch inspection on Twitter and it was just all these people tagging Spears and Joe Edwards asking in terms of pitch him inspection and said that they spoke to the locals about it and I just laughed it off so District, this is actually gonna be used to this at that time here.	0.0

That was a good review. And it was awesome. Here's I'll post a link in chat for how to leave a review as well.	1.0
I got to be honest with you. You don't want to look back on your life old and gray and say I could add or I should have taken that one opportunity. That one action that one chance that could have given me a completely different life to move that engine order to build even just the slightest bit of momentum 1 inch is all it takes it's the time in your life where it's do or die. What are you going to do lock into what you want and lock out everything that wants to keep you from getting there but makes you feel happy and fulfilled what lights you up from inside. How do you want to feel as Person, it's the time when you're feeling like you're scraping the bottom of the barrel you're in the dark, but it's up to you to change your perception to shed some light on where you are. It's the time when you're ready to give up. But you know, if you do you'll never be able to live with yourself with the guilt and shame of not pulling yourself out of this state become your biggest support system. You can't keep allowing the lack of support from others to discourage you to the point where you don't take action and you end up giving up. Up on your dreams overnight success of the fantasy but real success is within your reach no matter who you are no matter where you are at in your life right now for you to pull your way back out of where you put yourself in understand it. Was you to put you there. No one else you you are here because of you and you're the only person that can get back out of it. So most people stop but successful entrepreneurs evide Learners and groups and individuals know, The Becoming better as a continuous consistent process not a game where the night sometimes we get too hung up on who doesn't support our Dream, right? My wife doesn't support my dream. My husband doesn't support my dream. My parents don't believe in my dream. Well, let me ask you a very important question. Do you support your dream your gifts your Billings your value? It's about you. You created the pot. You already lined the white and inclusive. It is now easier to identify the things that need to be learned from now you own it. You've heard of the instant success stories the Legends the Trailblazers the Rocks aren't they are the ones we Envy the other ones we want to be the stories. I've heard about people who achieve overnight success. They're just stories. It's a lot sexier to say someone just showed up and success rained down on them, but it's not the truth. There's always a hidden backstory of hard work of A lot of pain no one gets to the top without identifying what success feels like for them without sticking to it for 10 years or more without mastery. If you can't think if you can't bring yourself to move out of your current mental state to one of growth purpose and progress. I want you to follow me. Take a deep inhale. Ask yourself. What you need in your life right now close your eyes and exhale into the vision you have for your life. It's going to allow you to climb back out of the hole that you put yourself in shed light on your current position and be grateful for the experiences that are now about to take place. I'll ask you now. What is above you what's in front of you. You can't go any lower you spiral down as far as you can go. The only Direction now is up. All you have to do is just move that one inch many people won't understand why you're grinding they won't understand why you're attending masterminds and private workshops instead of partying all night long at the club. They're not going to understand that, you know that short-term sacrifices lead to long-term prosperity. Sometimes you need to let go of what you want now to get what you want later, but it's worth it because you're playing the long game success takes time success takes effort. But I promise you that when you finally get there, you'll look back at all of it, and you won't regret a single moment. They will understand that you're building a lifestyle that most people only dream about adding value that will pack the thousands of people and that what you do will leave a legacy long after you're gone from this Earth. They're not going to understand any of that and you know what you shouldn't care if they understand this or not. He's the thing to people can get to the one destination they can get to the same destination. But who's stronger at the end the one who had it easier or the one who started further back who started in a deeper hole who had to overcome more adversity those two people are going to get to the same spot the same destination. One of them is going to be stronger. Your only objective is to lock in on what you truly want for your Life so from now on get rid of the things that are just a distraction if it doesn't fall in alignment with your goals your values the direction you want to go and the place you want to be it is not for you. You need to Define your teeth aim not someone elses. The only way to achieve success without giving up on your happiness is to understand and Define. What is it? Like for you? You got to understand that when you have a vision or a great purpose to add value to the world. This is your journey alone to travel you need to clean yourself to look further than a few months a year. What do you want to do? Do and have at that time. Who do you want to be? How do you want to serve and contribute when you have that vision gets real with yourself and ask what needs to happen now to make that Future Vision my reality. So I take a deep inhale stand up straight lift your chin off your chest pull your shoulders back and start to look in the direction of where you want to go move that each when you get to that. State creating results in your area of expertise is almost effortless. It's an organic process that comes easily to you. Remember the further you spiral down just means the more growth there is on the way back up in the stronger you'll be and you're still waiting around for some kind of signal to finally go hard and give your dreams everything. You got stop seeing it as work ahead of you, but there's only growth ahead of you. There's only That can be had that's it. You can only go up from here and the growth is needed to be where you want to beat. I want you to tell yourself right now that you don't need permission to pursue your dreams. Not my permission not your family's permission not loved ones. Not any expert who rules or anybody else. Never needed anyone else has permission to tap into your greatness. The only kind of success that matters is the kind that lasts if you achieve success only to have it slip through your fingers. All you have then is Disappointment understand that you can't change what you've done wrong, but you can change your perception of it and that's what's going to help you move that inch.	1.0

Yeah. I think the stakes are much higher and the industrial environment. It's on the business disruption side. So lost Revenue, Related to construction activity. That's a huge driver as well as just the magnitude of their construction spin. So they're looking at it from both sides right there looking at it from how long is it going to take to construct this new plant or retrofitting existing plant? And what's the overall cost of construction services that I'm going to you know that I'm gonna spend on construction services over the next 10 years and and they are capital planning on that type of arising Capital planning in commercial. Environments tends to be a shorter Horizon. And so that also then also challenges how we think about Innovation and work programs in things that we can do to make the construction delivery process more effective like off-site construction. And I also think the dollar spent is smaller as well. Like you said you might have one off buyers or Construction Services or even if they're not one off they may build a project every five years. So you're essentially are a one-off type Builder or they're planning Horizon is Noah's law. So if Multi family developer or Builder cash right now. You're probably saying I hope I hope the music keeps playing for another 24 36 months and I'm running out this wave of multifamily boom, and I'm not really quite sure where this Market will be five years from now, whereas oil and gas and petrochemical owners there. They've got a 10 15 20 year view on the capital spent where that's going.	0.0

Want to lose 10 pounds or more for most people it's toning losing body fat. Just being yeah, I would say that like more body composition wanting to and you know, 80% of all clientele are females. And so if you think about after pregnancy, if you think about how females invest in their lashes their nails their plastic surgery everything their hair, you know, they invest in their bodies and so but with males is a little different because you know, we go through Sports we have friends that we hang out with that we all gym and like Sigmund Freud said it like most males the reason why we exercise So it's sex-related. So he says like the reason why people want to drive fast cars are the reason why they want to buy nice shoes of the reason why they want to dress a certain way is because they want to attract other people. It's like something called pheromones. So yeah, it's very very interesting. So he says a lot of the decisions that we actually make the color that we want the body that we want or the kind of house or car or job. You know, there is kind of like sex-based kind of Interest Is pretty interesting, you know, but anyway back to Just Fitness and itself being a trainer for the past four years has saved my life it gave me a sense of purpose and I've dealt with a lot of drug addiction to the past and also dealt with you know, just finding my own security and life but personal training kind of just fell into my lap and it allowed me to do something greater than myself. So it was nice and Growing up are going to college you didn't study to be a nosy right now. I wanted to do a first, you know, I wanted to be a doctor but I didn't want to be a doctor. It was something that my parents wanted me to do. Yeah, you know and then as I started realizing what I really wanted to do, I just kind of went with my own instincts. There's that Jim Carrey thing that he said where ya know you can either live your life doing something that you kind of like doing and fail at that. Or you can live your life and do something that you love right and fail at that like at least go out with doing something that you love because you know, he talked about his dad and his dad just you know wasn't really living happy lives. Thanks for trying to find, you know purpose like what really drives you what gives you fulfillment in life. It's really just about service. It's about what you're doing for other people. That's what gives you like the most Joy before you're doing Fitness.	1.0

Yeah with my disgusting burp. I apologize for any one who had to hear that. So last two weeks ago. We did the worst parent teachers episode. And basically we got through bedtime and a couple other times it's dinner time and some other shit and there's a lot of stuff we didn't get to and we had so many comments and so many different little topics within it that we wanted to finish it off. So that's what we're doing today and the first One of the top of the paper maybe not the top of the list but the top of the paper that I put together is homework. So today my kid gets home and he has to do like reading responses once a month where he has to do basically like a really brief book report on whatever book He's reading. I had to sit down with him and like help them structure it because like each there's three paragraphs and each one has to have kind of a different thing. I'm sitting with them and I much prefer this to math homework with him because the mass shit. I can't even do half it like it's getting more snow. He's in fourth grade is getting more sophisticated in the Common Core just the principles of it are tough. And before you start bashing Common Core. Yeah. I find it difficult. I understand the rationale behind it essentially is to give you like mechanisms be able to do math in your head in a more logical way the kind of the way that we do it like if you're breaking up a tip. You divide it by 10 you do all that shit right away with not really how we were taught. We were taught memorization and all that shit. Whatever. I'm not going to get in a comic or different app.	0.0

I mean, I I have always gosh my parents got Divorced when I was we moved here to st. Louis when I was in third grade my parents got divorced when I was in fourth grade and that was a pretty ugly divorce. And so because of that my parents had put me in counseling with my brother. So I was used to that concept and then I went through high school and my dad was diagnosed with ALS and that just whole concept of watching my dad died for 18 years that was a lot but in the middle of that I kind of I was always the kid who had To do all the things I mean the old the oldest so I always felt the need to always be have be perfect and get good grades and Achieve and do all the great things - Sports because I suck at Sports and basically I went to college had a awful breakup with a boyfriend and I just kind of went off the deep end. I was I would say I can't quite remember two years of my life and rightfully so and that's that. My twin just the combination of my dad and that that break up like we were going to get married. It was like a whole thing. Like we were we were there and going I switched schools and like it just all kind of like whoo One Time Hit me and at that point my parents were like, okay, it's time like we need to talk to somebody you need to go see somebody and I started seeing a therapist and a weekly basis and I was diagnosed with anxiety PTSD from my parents divorced. From fourth grade which always seems kind of strange but I guess yeah, they're the experts there and it was recording of my Apple watch was recording that and so I started seeing by somebody and we talked and I we did we I went every week and like they would give me things to work on or things so and I was medicated at that point. I think I was on two different medications and I felt good and I felt like I was starting to like get the tools that Did to like handle my situation and and then kind of calm myself down when I was, you know, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They actually were able to help me give me extra time for taking tests and things like that at school because I would just get so overwhelmed that I could like put I wouldn't even take the test. I would just sit there and like fries. Yeah, which then made my last two years of college extremely difficult, right? And but then it was one of those really crazy things that I met my husband. Well, it was my seen my super senior year of Cool, super super semester my life physical senior plus like the extra semester and I met Jeff and it was one of those things that like, I don't know if it was just our yin and yang - of our personalities. He was able to just come in and be a really great kind of source of balance and understanding for me and slowly over that first year of us dating. I wean myself off of all of the medication that I had been on now people would be like, oh that's probably not the best idea but for He understood like where I was coming from and he knew my whole background and he was like he was in favor. Whatever I needed to do. Yeah, but he definitely wanted to make sure that one he could be as part of a because he could be in our relationship and so I have not been on medication since then but up until now I have recently started well in the last year or so. I started going back to a therapist just with Hattie going back to school and trying to figure out life and what's next for me in terms. Of the crazy world and just my role as a blogger and an influencer how that's changed. I get a lot of anxiety from just being a blogger. Yeah. So being on Instagram all the time feeling like you always have to be on and feeling exhausting for an extroverted interview. Yes. So exhausted. I'm feeling like you always have to have something fresh and new and that are going to get people excited to see what you're doing that day. That's A lot and then the flip side of that is if you would if you think you post something that's so you think you work so hard you did so great and then it tanks and it's like right. Well, you know, maybe I'm a failure or what's going on and then then there's days where like or I get a comments or I get like a series of things happen. I'm also really bad about like collecting all of my feelings and then exploding. Yeah. So that's also a whole nother conversation for another day, but it's I could basically like have a comment that will trigger me and then I Disappear for like a couple of days and and I just don't want to deal with like the world. But here I am. I've selected a profession that makes me forward facing to the world, but I'm human so it's kind of hard like it's it's a lot. So yeah, so I mean I find it helpful to you go to a therapist now I do so, but I feel like sometimes I find it helpful like we just sometimes we have nothing to talk about and like and those are the days I don't you. I have the same situation you go in and having nothing to talk about and then like some ugly yucky stuff. Just yeah boils up from the bottom and you're like where did that come from? So like did not play in that but here we are.	0.0

Oh my gosh, I I actually have a blank on this one. I think maybe two sides of the coin from a client's perspective. This may not be answering your question directly Jake but from a client perspective their perception of home staging it could be quite an expensive investment or them and they might not want to spend that money to Stage a home to sell but then on the flip side. The home stages I guess wanting to come into the industry that it isn't there is so much more Blood Sweat and Tears involved in in home staging then just, you know, making a bed and fluffing pillows. Yeah, there's so much more involved. I think that's probably all I can give you at them.	1.0

This is a very good order we like it. So let's start with number ten. Number ten is Bunker bunker is is very much.

It ain't that new but it was just an album that I there's a found myself listening to when I was at work the other night. I was listening to her. I was listening to Miguel All I Want Is You debut album? A lot of people slept on it. A lot of people got up on it, you know saying depending on who you are shit was hot, and it's still it's still it's aged. Well, even though it ain't even 10 years old. Yeah, but still a good ass out and I listened to it on occasion. Nice shit. They got something for everybody on that, you know saying if you your fan out upbeat you got something for you use Phantom slow shit got some flavor like that seductive shitty got something for you.

Hello and welcome to the volunteer firefighter podcast where we listen in to a group of rural firefighters as they give their opinions on the challenges. They face both on and off the fire ground. We release a new episode every week. So please hit that subscribe button leave us a rating and share this with your fire family and friends now onto this week's episode. Where as always we ask the question. Are you DTF? Hello and welcome to the volunteer firefighter podcast. My name is Carl and tonight. I got pretty much an empty podcast room. I do have Scott. Oh Todd. Thanks getting the top and I have Scott. Hey and I are tan. Hello and yeah projects. Yes anymore. Is it is it true? And it's just you're here. There is a little bit of a break and we're going to have Kevin robbed, but I think careful was too. Tired and Rob go well, we are absolutely probably sent to Australia. So when we buy it for a while, but yeah, it's got some news a tractor-trailer.	1.0
Yeah, but then it doesn't make you so happy that what we've got now it does work and how quickly a job because it was just money wasn't it that we couldn't see Morgan as one man by himself if he would have had billions there were had all these records on Isn't it you didn't own all those players, but obviously we couldn't buy them and we got 10p Strikers.	0.0
Yeah. I just got anything to say about yourself.	1.0
Can you can leave I guess I guess you can just walk out the door. And then I think do you say POG in real life?	1.0
Hey, what's your favorite Biggie's huh?	1.0
Yeah, the only time I'm trying to think of I feel like we usually say immediately when the Indians make a trade that they got the better end of it. Don't we like I mean, I think the night that Trevor Bauer got traded it was like we found out one named after another and it was because at first it was like think we do we try to remember the order because I was going all around the room trying to get Intel from players is they heard from people or Get you know, you get a text from a front office person at one point or a an Asian and and it's like you slowly pieced this together and each piece. It was like, oh my God, this is like better and better. It's unbelievable. I feel like most of the Indians trades your immediate takeaway is they got the better end. Like I remember like the Eric Gonzalez trade and who knows how that will end up it was said like a three four. Three or three four two. Yeah, and obviously Max Mara was a bust but like Jordan loop low looks like he's going to absolutely destroy left-handed pitching and maybe more and they have them for a long time and are cazalas every time he played on the field last year. He injured one of his teammates. So that looks like it's immediately that seemed like a decent trade because Lupo had a pretty good minor league pedigree. The only one that didn't was was the on Gomes trade and we all look foolish now, Your Roberto Perez had and seeing what Daniel Johnson could do. So I feel like they always seem to win trades immediately. And I mean like obviously long-term. They do Francisco. Mejia hasn't done anything and the Padres have like been in the market for catching. I hope so. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what that sentiment is. Like if they end up trading Lindor who is everybody's favorite player and clearly the best player and on the roster Like fans allow themselves to say man. It sucks losing Lindor, but holy shit.	1.0
I don't know what it is. Why don't they come in waves? It must be like hack a launch like they're just like launched a new hack or something and I did together. But yeah right now it feels like it's like a really bad time to matchmake.	0.0

She was horrified when I definitely understood why she would be, you know feel like, you know was personal to her right?	0.0
He was always like like playing and doing his thing but nappytabs were just so cool to work with they were very positive always positive made sure that you got if you didn't get it, they would always explain them. Like just just the most amazing people so cool to work with them.	1.0
But the joke there was that he is part of a group of people in Brazilian jiu-jitsu that it's just not what they do. And as long as that divide exists, like locks are always going to be powerful because there's going to be a group of people that they're just going to work on. Oh, So that's sort of my ADC recap from a game theory perspective some of the big tournaments coming up between now and the end of the year think the big one is going to be the noogie worlds. And I think there's a couple in between that so I'm looking forward to kind of watching those and seeing what the trends are that we can learn from. There's a couple new studies that are in the pike at high percentage. I'm going to obviously keep doing the podcast if you want to check out my interviews with Tom to Blossom. Eddie Bravo, they're up on grappling Insider. You can just type in either my name or or one of their names into the search bar and we are starting to do a little bit more interviews as we get access to the athlete. So hopefully they'll be some exciting stuff coming up with that. I spent some time this week reorganizing the website because I felt like it was it was harder than it needed to be defined older articles. So what I did was I sort of read it all the categories and I think I have Some basic categories right now, which is Game Theory articles stats and research articles and podcasts articles and then all the articles I kind of like tag with their keywords. So if you are just looking for an article that you're not sure exists just try typing in the search bar should be a little bit easier to find than and spin the past. Yeah, that's just been a long-term thing that's been bugging me and I'm going to keep trying to make the website better. And of course make the podcast better. Thanks everyone for Or listening. I'll see you next week. Have a great week of training.	1.0

Like there are so many positive benefits that we get from moving our bodies and the second you make exercise about either a punishment for something you ate or simply for the pursuit of weight loss. It just takes the fun away and if we just remove that from the equation and treated exercise as a celebration of what your body we can do in a celebration of having the ability to even move your body, which is also just a privilege in and of itself how would shift your relationship to movement like, what would you do differently? You know, I also see people thinking like we live in like the no pain no gain culture right where it's like people think that you need to feel depleted and exhausted and like you can't move after snack Orangetheory. Yeah, right like okay calling them out, but it's true. It's like Who made that rule like why can't exercise be something that energizes me and that I like just enjoy but then I can have enough energy for the rest of my day. So maybe I don't go off because of in hiring me.	0.0

Um, yeah, it was a wonderful feeling and then you just keep pushing the envelope that bit further you people thinking maybe I could try doing this and that's just that's just how it happened to I've had some time off here and there in the past. I've got had been injured and when I was pregnant and after I had my daughter I had some time off but you're just the past maybe four years. I've really really got back into it.	1.0
This week daylight savings has been kicking our butts. So we have had a lot of just morning meltdowns this week of really like we had I don't know if Elise was ever like this but we have had he doesn't like to wear socks because I don't like to wear socks. Yeah, it's a sensory thing, but I also don't like to wear socks and I don't I don't I don't promote socks in the summer and she always wears like natives usually don't wear socks because they're perforated and my mom gets so mad at me because she thinks that their room Her heels anyway off topic there. Um, but it's the other day. She came out with a summer dress on and it was strawberries all over it. She's like I'm wearing this to school and I'm like, well, how do you want? It's like 20 degrees outside. Yeah, we got to wear tights we get tights on her and then it was just like the World War 3 with the seam in the thing in the boot and the we couldn't make it work. So finally like she's like in the living room no clothes on. She's like, I'm not going to school today. This is Aeolus and I'm like, well, you have to go to school one. So then we're trying to be logical. I'm like, well you like to go down the flagpole at school. So if you don't wear tights you have to your legs gonna get really cold on the flagpole. Yeah, and you can get hurt like you could get frostbite or something. So what finally be like agreed to pants and a shirt but it's like whoo buddy, like the sock thing is a challenge for us right now. So today I Center in glit like some glittery looking Ugg boots.

Absolutely. I got into it my dad a little bit, you know going against his beliefs. He you know wants me to be financially secure and his own belief is I have to be in the medical field where I have to do something that related to succeed but then I think really the bigger picture for him was just me want him wanting me to get out my comfort zone and not settle for mediocrity, but my paycheck does not define that. You know and once I kind of stay true to myself, I'm much more like my mom. We're both very emotional people and she followed her passion. She loves what he does. She does. She definitely has moments of high stress, but at the end of the day, you know, she's not waking up or having like anxiety to come into work on Monday. She went, you know went through that phase for 20 years of her life where she was working for a company Sunday night. You know, she have to wake up the next morning 5:30 6 o'clock wouldn't get home till seven stuck in traffic. Have to make dinner for the kids only get 30 minutes to an hour with her kids. And I remember being kid always wanting that time with her, you know, like where's mom like, you know, and it was tough but you know, sometimes tragedies our disguises blessings and seven years ago when she got late 7 or 10 years ago. I don't know when she got laid off from her job. She just decided to follow her heart and open her own catering business and now, you know by the by the blessings of God and the Lord she's Families doing well, you know and I know we're very humbled for all the opportunities but you know, I'm just really happy that she can lead right she followed she's doing what she loves.

They have regular office jobs and they just come to me because they want to just just Unleash the Beast with it, you know, so I do have a lot of like gentleman who come in who want to learn how to properly ballroom dance because they want to surprise your wives. That's so sweet and they end up staying and actually taking their wives to the lessons and improving. So I feel like I have so much experience with people who have never danced before and Making them into really beautiful dancers or into just a dancer when you think you can't you know, so I already have that experience. But it I would love to really get to show my personality as well because I do love meeting new people and seeing how like we can work together and stuff like that. So definitely it would have definitely been fun to work with a celebrity partner season 29.	1.0
Challenger maybe, but Naomi had to do it and you wouldn't think Naomi is like this like top Valentina is the girl who does nothing at the school project will put her name on them. So I was like perfectly. I just I felt like she when she was talking to both of them. I felt like in her head. She I mean we all know she lives in her own world, but I feel like she thought they're not going to send me home because of her relationship with them and because In her head she deserves to be in the finale that being said anybody, you know, it's like you can say that but then you can't say that Latrice can't think the same thing because that was the issue before was that Latrice is like why I've been around a long time. I deserve to be here. I shouldn't have gone home. Then you can't be mad. You didn't mean does that make sense? Well, thank you can't be mad at me choose for saying it and then B and then be okay with Valentina going we are well I shouldn't be because I'm fabulous well. Latrice is fabulous. I'm sorry Sheila made herself. I think yeah, absolutely. She said absolutely I didn't do anything. Yeah, we'll go. Well and even when she says give me a reason to keep you. She just said do what you think is best and I think that in when I heard that I went she thinks you're not going to send her home. So she's just telling you to do what you need is a great social player because she said yourself a few times. Yeah, but you know, the third time really wasn't her child in her favor. She wouldn't last one Survivor.	0.0

Yea, you know that good made this or who wrote who made this? There's like even just today we're looking for something and and as I was like owner who wrote this is a trailer just came out today. I'm like, I wonder who wrote this for a morbius. Okay. He said yeah, it doesn't look very good. But I was curious who wrote it and I went to it and found out that the writer also did the kings of Egypt so I'm pretty sure my feelings about that movie or Justified. I love that movie but is so dumb anyway, so okay in terms of a plan. Yeah. I didn't have one and immediately but as I got a little bit older and start to realize as I started getting to the age where I needed to have a plan being you know, 17 18 years old. I am I going to college am I what am I doing? I like I had I had come to the decision that I wanted to go to film school. But at the same time like I didn't really feel comfortable like trying to ask my parents to help pay to send me to art school. I'm not it for when I'm not even sure that they would have liked agreed to that. You know, I think my dad's a pretty practical person. You probably have been like like well if you're gonna go to you know School Going to pay for it. We want to make sure it's something we can get a return on the investment for which makes sense. But my parents are also very they've always been very supportive of all the creative things I wanted to do when I was a place to play guitar might like my dad. He'll buy me like this. Nice big Marshall Half Stack and let you know it's always very supportive of this stuff. So that's just conjecture on my part. Is that how he would have felt about it? But good now you need to support especially in a different type of you know, you weren't doing sports and things like that.	1.0

Everything is knowing that you know in any small way or any big way. I could have a positive influence on someone's life. You know, I feel like a lot of us haven't sometimes our judgment is cloudy. Sometimes we don't know why things are the way they are and so I just try to help increase my clients awareness and understanding the true problem and then going to the root and seeing how we can transform them internally and then eventually as we do that the external transformational just follow, you know, so it's more just about what are you doing day? Like, why do you why do people want to lose 10 pounds? Why do what people want to lose 30 pounds? But really it's Yes, it's a health decision. But it's also an emotional decision. Yeah, like good exactly. Right. It's a you know, what sometimes the opinions of others have like a huge role but I think the most important thing is your own opinion, you know, everybody's different. So what makes you happy is it losing 20 pounds? Is it getting a little bit stronger? Is it, you know increasing your self defense is it just being more functional, you know, everything's different majority of your clients.	1.0
Yeah. Absolutely. And I think I should goes really hand-in-hand with we're just talking about with with criticism and the piece of advice I have is get over yourself. Like if you have an ego and you don't listen to what other people say and you don't look at yourself and be Be honest with yourself you're not going to do as well. If you if you can look at something you've done and be like I can do this better instead of like I'm awesome. Everybody bow before me you'll get better because that means you're open and willing to learn that's great.	1.0

No, I agree. He's just really Limited in the coverage and it's one of those things where Taylor rap is a player where you're taking a high floor with a not much higher. Doing so it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Yeah, you're right. He would kind of solidify the position and he wouldn't be bad but he wouldn't be amazing. It would just be solid and I guess that's worth something but that's not what I'm looking for here. This offense needs Playmakers specifically, I would love Deonte Thompson here. I think that that's a good pick I wouldn't be upset at they took Deonte Thompson 44. I think it's great value specifically considering what he does. He's got legitimate concerns about some of the facts facets of his game one Thornhill. Would be a fantastic selection here as well. He's also got legitimate concerns, but I think that he's going to be a solid selection, but I'm looking at Marquis Brown. I know that I know that he does not fit their traditional receiver, but I do think that that could change a little bit this year with Matt LaFleur the home it's tough to get on board with Marquis Brown because of the lisfranc injury and just how small he is but Man, when you turn on the tape, he is electric and it's just so much fun to watch and to think about what he would provide this not only does offense, but the Special Teams unit Depot Samuel is a close second in that department. He didn't he could just do so many different things and Kelvin Harmon is just solid, you know, you're getting a good receiver of Kelvin Harmon. So I'm good with any any of those five.	1.0

So and maybe you can wrap like a band. Down around your face so that you don't worry about something splashing up. Maybe you can wear gloves, you know, I don't really need necessarily need to do those things when I'm cleaning my own toilet, but it's just an idea but the more often you clean it, it won't be as gross of a job. Especially if people are just kind of using that toilet brush as needed and then I keep it soaking in a solution in a cleaning solution, you know in that holder so, you know, just whatever cleaning It usually kind of pour some in that holder and that makes your bathroom smell nice and keeps your toilet brush disinfected.	1.0
Let's bring it out there and well, I'm I'm really guilty of like sharing memes all in like inspirational quotes and things like that on Instagram all the time talking about you anxiety and self-care and you know how you can manage it and sure that sounds nice and fluffy, but not all the time. Can we manage it with memes and coffee? And taking a bubble bath. So right which I mean it all helps but yeah, sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah, we'll see so so I know Audrey and I have spoken obviously beforehand about our previous experiences with anxiety and we have both in in overtime bin both diagnosed with a clinically diagnosed with anxiety. So I thought what we do first is kind of tell our like a briefly tell our story about how the It impacted us and then kind of what we're doing with it now and then maybe talk about some ideas of how we can other than a bubble bath how we can kind of help to relieve some of that anxiety when we're having those stressful days. Yeah, you wanna go first.	1.0
Yeah, so I think honestly here I'm looking. This is possibly where we might see a running back come off the board. I think we're going to see the Packers pursue a past catching running back a passing specialist running back. There's a couple of them in this year's draft one of the James Williams from Washington State. He might be around five pick. He doesn't meet any of the thresholds necessarily he kind of is just below all of them. I think Miles Sanders is like the only one that meets them. All right now. Tony Pollard from Memphis is a guy who's kind of rising updraft boards as well. So this is where it really starts to get interesting with the Packers decide to do where they did where they decide to add depth, but I think what I'm doing here personally is I'm looking at a guy like dalen mac. So a guy like dalen mac. He's he meets the thresholds for the most part. He's a little little less agile than you'd want him to but he's a true nose tackle. He would take some of the duties off of Kenny Clarke the Packers have already met. With him, once which kind of says a lot to me, they're not meeting with a lot of players at this point, which is very surprising to me as considering the amount of visits at the rest of the teams in the league of had but the Packers have not met with a lot of players. So I feel like they're kind of they've already got their guys that they're kind of like targeting in on day lamech is a guy they've already met with I believe that was back at the Senior Bowl and he's a guy who pretty much meets what they're looking for. He's going to be a specialist guy, but he's gonna he's gonna be a tremendous nose. The NFL he won't provide much more. Other than that, but you'll be a tremendous run Defender and he can provide some juice from the interior as a pass rusher as well. He's got some he's got some nice moves that he likes to whip out every now and then so I'm looking at a guy like Darren Mack here. That would be my value pick and my best fit.	1.0
Yes, you know, I think I think I want to agree with Betty during this and just say that he's honestly probably just lonely and Confused from what I'm seeing. I think he's very trustworthy but he just doesn't know maybe who is his true friend. Like he said he got dropped from the farm. He felt very lost. But he lost his friends because he joined the farm. So he just needs to really be with his friends and really gain there. Trust back I think and we have a lot of people in the chat. Yes who are agreeing and they're saying that Kevin is we got a rune who Cote? I'm sorry if I butchered your name, but he says who's trust who trust Kevin is true to Betty and helps her or is he trying to get back in? What do you think think he's helping her? Maybe? He's just trying to get back in some sort of a friendship grazed or he's just lonely.	1.0

I'm sorry. I feel like the craziest thing we need to talk about to is Cheryl Cheryl pause that she's got a rivalry with their the principle. That's Brewing. But there's one thing I want to talk about shell first case that we see her at the beginning of the episode. We saw last season that the way they were able to kind of make her think that her brother was alive is that they were they were faking that her brother was still alive, but now we see that she does have indeed the dead body of her brother in her the basement of this house.	1.0
Always come up in the middle of the night are or we tried to stop them. You can't come up until five and they would come in and lay with us. Is that over the past like two weeks seems like that has stopped ocean and now I have to go down and get them which is has its pros and cons but is better than I'm sleeping better because they're not coming to my room and waking me up and wake yourself up now, but I got to wake myself up but I also have to go get them up and it makes things more urgent right because they're less awake because they haven't woken up already and If you go down there and sometimes they're still asleep.	0.0
