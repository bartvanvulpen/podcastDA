Yeah. No, I think it is worse. I think like the shooting feels worse like coming from like on client to 64. I think you can it's a noticeable different if you play a lot on client, but yeah in terms of movement stuff, I think it's like so my new and I don't think and maybe this is like a contrarian view. I don't think the right move is to move everything to 128 take like, I don't think that's smart. I think it's like right there.	0.0
I probably would have started tracking my inventory from Okay, I started buying so much furniture and accessories that at the time I think it was you just get so carried away in how busy your business is and you know, you're trying to fill the many hats that you need to are in a small business that I just left. I didn't do an inventory list, so it wasn't until last year. I think it was where I actually started getting serious about documenting everything that right. At home staging had acquired over the four years to make my life easier because when you're standing in your shares and you need you know, 12 Euro pillows and three sets of bedside lamps and you've got no idea if you have those available or not. It's really hard.	0.0

I love what you said because so to answer your question from earlier like a lot of people think okay. If I if I ditch the diet mentality, which I'll name as the first principle of intuitive eating. eating is stepping away actually from those diets from the strict rules about what's quote-unquote good or bad for you and instead giving yourself permission to include all different types of foods in your life in a way that promotes balance and you know, just Variety in general so To answer the question. Can I eat whatever I want? It's like yeah, you can you can eat whatever you want. But if you truly are in tune with yourself and listening to your body, as you said Casey, I would I would imagine and I've experienced and I know a lot of people I work with have experience that you do want to eat more foods that make you feel good because when you are connected to how you feel after certain foods, you're less likely to just eat, you know foods that drain that energy or that make you feel Early tired sure, you're going to eat them sometimes but I think people have this idea that like if I didn't have this super intense discipline around what I ate, I would just like, you know stock up on french fries and Twizzlers all day and I think we need to give ourselves more credit than that.	1.0
What are you doing here?	1.0
Right but but over, you know over the years that followed, you know, I kept on like I said reading magazines about it. And this is like in the, you know, pretty early days of the internet and IMDb had just come out and so it used to be so okay, even before that. I would go to this video store and they had like a big like movie catalog or not catalog but like an encyclopedia and so like, you know, the first person I went looked up with James Cameron because he's who wrote directed Terminator 2 and so I could find out like it wasn't as easy back then to find out who You know what filmmaker like what movies he done like a complete like, you know filmography, but then, you know IMDb came out and and suddenly I was able to like search for this stuff. It was all just like text back then right? I was about to say IMDb wasn't out yet. You nailed it? Yeah. Yeah. That's our reference. Now. That's that is our dictionaries. We like I probably Search IMDb for piece of trivia. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 10 to 15 times a day easily totally easily and I'm definitely when you're watching a movie, right? Absolutely.	1.0
Yeah, but okay, so no face. Yeah, I was going to say if you have your you can only tell ya that's gonna get boring if you will actually go insane. I don't think like I think I more likely would rather see people than have my phone on be honest with you.	0.0
No, so I know not the only one but Sis got a drinking ticket in high school. You did what I told you this. I don't think so. Yeah, I did there was like a couple people at my school that did and of course I was one of them like are you surprised? Are you I mean, no, so I was at this kids graduation party. I was like a junior. This kid was a senior. He had like a big party for his graduation and everyone was drinking. I wasn't the only one and a lot of I a lot of Vermont parties. I remember being in high school and cops coming to all of our parties. Is that just like a Vermont thing or did that happen to you too? It happened in college, but This happened in high school for us like in the middle of the woods in high school. Like I can only think of one time cops came and I'm trying to think of like what I did like it wasn't it wasn't anything that like wasn't handled like we were outside and they basically were like stop drinking like we have a ghoul can annoy. It was like a noise complaint like a neighbor called and said it was too loud. But like they never checked if anybody was drinking know there was like multiple parties. I got breathalyzed at in high school. Seriously. Yeah, that did not happen to me. I know that was like a thing and people like me that's why I like Hitler. It sounds bad that like not a drinking ticket underage. Whatever whatever but like it was so common. Like it happened to like a handful of people. I know not everybody but I happen to be one of them are just special. I am special help. So how I got the drinking ticket it was A friend's graduation party, he was a senior and he you know graduating high school. He had a big party a bunch of people from different ages went like this is like a pretty big. I remember it being a lot of people there and the cops show up and everybody like this is such a typical like Vermont thing. I know you all can relate like we just like all run in the woods like this was like the thing for Grant away. Oh my God, this was like a thing. Like we all just ran like ran into the woods. We slept into the abyss like and I was just like following somebody but like sis was so drunk. She couldn't like keep up solo me and like my like, I don't even know I was like trying to keep up like trying to hang beer in my hands like running. I'm wrong. I was like I got this I was like I got this And then of course, of course it was like I can't remember who I was with. I think I was like with some guy but we got caught and the cop was like come this way with me and you know, I was always taught that if a cop, you know catches you running you, don't try to fight it you just go along you go with him you apologize and that's what I did. So we went with him was like a group of like five kids and like we were the only girl So yeah, Jesus.	0.0
Sometimes you need to sweep around your washer and dryer throw away your lint collection or your empty detergent containers, and then don't forget. To do something outside today. Maybe you need to sweep your back patio or your front porch. Remember your house will be cleaner if you sweep the exterior entrances of your home, and then use welcome mats inside and out, but maybe you need to pull some weeds or you know, pick up some clutter from your yard the sunshine will do you good. Thanks for listening. And as always happy cleaning.	1.0

Storage is an issue. So attending the Symposium recently instead need hearing the storage company get up on stage and talk about how they can offer all these things to stages. Like we just don't have any of that down here and I'm sure in a lot of regional areas don't have that access. So storage is quite expensive down here removalists are expensive. So I've been lucky to find a couple of guys who do Up me, they're not a furniture removal us as such with the truck, but they are very good to me and they do look after my friend nature when we are moving it. But also the biggest challenge that I've found is is actually educating people about what home staging actually is in the area when I first started right at home staging II overheard my dad telling someone what right at home staging was all about and he got it completely wrong, so I had to tell my parents It's like basically gave them a script on what home staging does so and to this day I still find it's an education piece with everybody on home staging and how it can benefit them when they're selling their home, which is a very yeah, I agree and it's it could be quite difficult because you not only selling yourself.	0.0
All right. Well a few moments ago, as you said it was his New York come up all happening at the same time. You mentioned puffy because at that that time bad boy was was blowing up and one of the groups that blows up you have a personal connection to so when we come back from the break we are going to talk about you and the lovely mrs. ABS one member of the group Total certainly one of my favorites growing up. So we're going to talk about her and I'm gonna put you on the spot about a couple things. All right, so don't get too worried. Well get a little bit worried but more with me how you started out co-ed. So you like watch what a hook but more with Omar Epps when we come back. You know, it's not a lot of people I think to these like in these times especially like writing is such an underrated ability and the fact that you've been writing, you know, your whole life is really incredible considering, you know, again, it's just not an ability. I think that a lot of people have is one that's underrated so much so that you follow this path of writing that you wrote a book right from Father list of fatherhood.	1.0
No, I agree. I had as much as I like do the young receivers like slate and Boykin and even Wesley little bit the Packers young receivers. I want to see what they can do this year. And we've already taken Debo Samuel off the board. So I think another you offensive lines the way to go. They do need to fortify it. McGovern's he's going to be a steady player. I think he's going to be a solid player for a long time. And I think that you'd and plus drafting a pure interior offensive linemen will help because years past we've always have two tackles and shifted him in. I think drafting a guy who's been a guard before gives him a little bit of that extra Edge when they come into camp and let you learn the intricacies right away. And so yeah, let's make Connor McGovern The Pick and so just a few more pics is till we get to our gift from the Washington Redskins at pick 118 and there goes miles Boykin right off the bat. So the three picks between McGovern and the current one Justin Hollins from Oregon goes to the Panthers miles Boykin to the Dolphins again because they take everyone that we want and Joe. Jackson of Miami goes to the Falcons So now top guys on the board Josh all over still out there from San Jose State. Jajuan Johnson from Miami Darius. Slaton Antoine Wesley. Treyvion Williams, Jacoby Myers Dennis daily Marquis Blair from Utah Ronnie Anderson from Oklahoma and Demarcus Lodge from Mississippi are the top guys on the board will further down the Border guys, like will Grier Terry Godwin Titus Howard Jared Stidham still on the board a little bit further down house Gaskins still down there as well, but There's still some good names out. There is still some good prospects for pick 118.	1.0
Yeah, exactly. I know other don't worry part of you is like, I've got a marathon to go that sucks. But then I was like no don't let that throw. It's a marathon yet only a marathon and but yeah and at that point, you know, you're starting to cross paths with more people. It was and then so I grabbed another at drop bag with some more food in it. And the next there's about 18 kilometres to checkpoint for and it checkpoint for I had my buddy run. I was coming on to join me for the last sort of 27 on ches. That was Aaron Cole batch and Aaron, it was great. So I sort of push through checkpoint to checkpoint for and you go through this section. It's my favorite part of the whole race even though about kilometer. He or the high 60s you're going up through what's it called Mount magnificent and into the fitness Conservation Park and it's just the so pretty through there like its Farmland at this is beautiful farm houses nestled in amongst these like really spectacular Rolling Green Hills. It is and the kind of Rocky, but they're also really green. It's just lovely and I really focused on Deserving that but also I focused on again anytime I could run I would run out hit the hills if it was a hill I would be if I was walking I was power hiking like I was really just wanted to keep my time to get my legs moving. And so I was at managing to power like it under 10 minutes per kilometer, which I was happy with so not nice work. Yeah pretty quick. There were people quicker than me at that. But you know, and at this point, I'd Fallen back a few places, but I sort of was focusing more on. And what I was doing and not worrying too much about the race itself and just worried about my own race. And then so again to check point for which was glorious and I for the first time I thought I'm gonna have a little sit-down at checkpoint for for a few minutes and that's that was my little reward for being very efficient through the previous age stations. It's at this point you at 77 km/h know you've really sort of broken its back and I Saw My Buddy Aaron and it was just you know reinvigorated me and it was funny though. My brain was getting a bit muddled as it is kind of now and I went to take something out of my back. My back was the first time I'd taken my pack off as well. I took my pack off briefly or took something out and I just somehow everything fell out of my pack and like I just had my shit everywhere and it's like I don't know how to put this back in and it's like I've been people laughing at me and And she's a really good atmosphere there and everyone just friendly and I got it all back in probably spent longer there at the age station that I really wanted to but you know it is what it is and it just some you know, it was not that was not part of the plan. But then with Aaron she just can't be honest and kept me running when I could run and made sure I kept sipping fluids and eating a beer and like it was a turn into a beautiful afternoon. Coming into the last sort of you come into kaipo forest from the last sort of twenty five k's and it's a pine Plantation. And so all right. Yeah. So pine trees everywhere. We've got a nice sort of feel and one going between farmland and pine plantations and like really I didn't have any like spectacularly low moments. I just I feel like I mean I was at low power low ish points, but I just was able to manage those low points better than I have in the past. So I'm really happy about that. And so my goal was always initially my main goal. I wanted to get under 12 hours, but I knew that was off the off the Record like 12 hours is pretty lofty goal one day one day one day but my next goal was to beat the Sun and so I thought I can still do that. So I had to do about under 13 hours to do that and I came into there's only nine kilometers between checkpoint four and five and I remember coming and so it's really nice short break. I grabbed a sat down had a ginger beer at checkpoint 5 didn't try to see there too long stuffed in some noodles. What took them on the go and I ate some of them and then had to ditch the rest because it was just getting a bit too hard to eat and I remember I had a what happened next? Yeah, then the last sort of 10 kilometers. Yeah, sad to feel a bit nauseous and then you know, but kept positive Aaron made me laugh and I was trying to high five as many volunteers and Spectators that I saw a long anyway, and then coming into the forest. I know the course really well the final and I actually from previous year. I had a landmark point where I knew. There was one kilometer to go but somehow this year I went past that last kilometer to go Mark and didn't notice and then I came around the other shit. The Finish Line was right in front of me was like just straight up by 200 meters and so some like always and I always was like somewhere I was able to leg it for the last couple of hundred meters and I managed to finish without using my head torch and not needing it probably if I was out for another 10 or 15 minutes. I would have had My head towards yeah, but I didn't need my head towards cross the line in 12 hours and 48 minutes and I'll start. Yeah, well, that's brilliant. Yeah, it's good.	1.0

I don't know and I did it and I think that that Catalyst we never want to have that happen again, you know, we never want that to happen again, but I think we have to take that message of how we felt by connecting with people. I'm still crying y'all. And I'm going to make you talk now, but all right, but how we felt and bring that to our classroom. So as your students are coming in, you know greet. I know this is people say all the time but greeting them and then looking them in the eye those are kind of two different things. And so when you combine those two things is pretty powerful. Okay.

Yeah. Well this your it's going to take you about 20 hours or so, I think yeah, I mean Yeah, what's crazy? What about the camera in particular? I remember and you probably remember to in Dark Souls 3 the camera of when they're you're like facing two bosses was always kind of annoying and I was like, well, I don't know how I'd fix it. You know like this is what are you supposed to do if there's to moving objects that you're supposed to keep on the screen. It's kind of impossible to fix but then this game for some reason it doesn't have that same issue. And even though there's like seven or eight enemies on the screen for some reason. I don't think about it. It's almost as if like the game was made with the intention of the camera as well, you know, like as a mechanic versus like making a level making a boss and then having a camera there like that's sort of what Dark Souls kind of fell into but it's true.	1.0

They were you don't all of a sudden get that mindset after you've done something bad.

Ring well, it's very exciting. And I guess it's something that I was a little bit naive probably being in Brisbane in the capital city. We had plenty of options when we started for hiring Furniture. So that that wasn't a limitation, you know, it was our real limitation was how much what you know, what happened we quickly could we build relationships with agents how quickly could we actually win some work and whatever work we were able to win it was either going to be constrained by you know, how many employees we had or how you know how we're going to actually fulfill. The orders whereas now I've met more people from Regional centers or rural sort of places something that didn't even cross. My mind was that there aren't even options to hire furniture and a lot of those places is that was that the case for you?	1.0

What do you typically do but they might think that you should go through that. My thing is just showing patience, you know, Transformations don't happen overnight and I think for me, it's just trying to challenge them in their weak areas and just keep them accountable drink more water. Like a lot of people don't drink enough water dude for females out there track your water intake at least 90 fluid ounces of water or two-thirds of your body weight and for males you want at least a hundred twenty fluid ounces or two-thirds of your body weight. So a lot of people when they train and I asked how much water they have. They're hella tired in the beginning and I asked how much water in there like I haven't had any water. I just had my coffee right and then if you're if you're sleeping for six to eight hours, you're not having any water then we wake up you go pee you have coffee you have you haven't had water for 10 12 hours possibly and then you try to work out and do cardio and less weights your guests 70% of your muscle is water that you need water. So that's number one. One two, I'll try to help them. Tell them to get a little more rest if they can because that's a big thing. But you know, if they slip I think it from me. I've learned that it's better just to keep showing positive encouragement instead of trying to tear them down. You know, it's kind of like parenting and you don't want to tear people down.	1.0

But yeah. Was great. It was doc said probably the best I've seen apply especially especially under Noona if we just take our chances are many times.

Well, it obviously would have happened but you know, we put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that second half a lot of unneeded pressure. Is that deeper and deeper which have been conscious of in the past few seasons. Anyway, I Watford New Year if I could Braga. Yeah, so it yeah, the first off was great should have put the going to bed, but it's one of those Delivered when it was terrible probably the worst team us. I've seen this either.

Evenly when I start this with my teams. They all look at me as if I am treating them like children around the second or third week. They get more excited and their answers get weirder as they become more comfortable with everyone. This reinforcement bonds them all and gives them things to talk about A Works towards my value of the team getting along. It's weird. How much to girls can Bond over both loving turquoise discipline. You've already created rules and discuss them both with your players as well as their families. Everyone is on the same page. Let's say you have some pretty basic rules like no kicking the ball. No swearing no side conversations during Huddle's Etc. So what happens when one of your girls gasp breaks one of these rules, this is a major decision. You need to make before the season. Ins because the first time it happens it sets a precedent. Are you going to let it slide? Will you give out warning after warning yet do nothing about it in the end or will you stop everything and send your players to the service line and make them run until you think you get the point across drop in the middle of a match and do push-ups as former players. We probably all experienced differing disciplinary Styles coming from our coaches maybe even differences from the same coach depending on their mood the head coach may have been extremely strict while the assistant was. Mainly there to encourage the girls on your team while you don't come into your first season wondering what sort of punishment your team will serve for various offenses. It is something you need to decide on make sure your other coaches are on the same page. Not sure where to start think about this. The whole point of discipline is to make your girl stop some sort of behavior. Usually one. They know they shouldn't do but decide to engage in any way. The best punishment is one that they do not want and will therefore try to avoid some rules one, bro. Are more detrimental to the team than others kick a ball out of the way when peppering not good, but likely just a reflex give them a warning Buddha ball across the gym after missing a dig. She's sitting out no questions asked which leads me to my next point my personal approach to rule-breaking is this you break a rule you sit out everyone knows the rules and I don't have the time or patience to give warnings in very rare circumstances. I'll give a warning but because my team's know that I'm a no-nonsense coach when it comes to breaking the rules warnings are rarely necessary while different age groups will have different kinds of rule-breaking you need to decide on punishments which are consistent with your temperament and coaching style. I don't personally agree with punishments such as running lines push-ups laps. What have you this gives those activities a negative connotation and I want my girls to want to do those things to be in better shape. I do make one exception to running as discipline simply because a former coach of mine used it and I think it's genius Swearing was not allowed on the team. And if someone decided they were going to cuss the entire team will get mad at them. But why why would a player be mad at another player for breaking a rule depending on the number of letters in the word of choice? That is how many laps the team had to run but wait, it gets better the person who swore would stand in the middle of the court or jam and count the number of laps out loud for the rest of the team. My old coach used pure pressure against us to curb our attitudes I can Practically guarantee that if you implement this rule with your team swearing will be minimal whatever disciplinary policies you decide on make sure you stay consistent in your enforcement of the rules. Just because one of the girls who has never once gotten in trouble is having a side conversation during a huddle do not let it go fairness is something girls are very sensitive to particularly when they feel it is going against them giving up the perception of playing favorites can be just as damaging to their trust in you as if you are actually playing favorites. Practice design one of the topics I'm most passionate about when it comes to volleyball is practice design organizing skill practice and game like drills in a way that builds up and culminates in proper skill execution is vital to running a successful practice. It is crucial that you spend more than just a few minutes coming up with practice until you are a seasoned coach and even then you'll probably spend more time tweaking drills to make practice just right. So let's talk about practice design what I mean by practice design is the a flow of your practices from one major category of skill work or Play Games Etc on to the next to begin. You always need to warm up. This should take roughly 10 minutes for each practice to make sure your girls have warmed up their muscles properly the rest of how you spend your time will vary depending on how long your practices are with younger players practicing for shorter amounts of time usually and can be broken up as follows Dynamic stretching stretches that make your players move warm-up game a game. That gets the players moving and playing volleyball but uses them into play there should not include scrimmaging and should limit full serves or attacking right away games with a lot of movement are ideal skill demonstration and concept introduction explain a new skill or concept for this example. I'll use jousting Jousting is one two players on opposing chords go up to direct a ball that is tight to the net and could end up on either side. This may be too advanced for younger teams, but is a good skill to practice. Of 12 and under or middle school volleyball explanation should take no longer than five minutes unless it is very complex skill or concept specific drill. Now you run a drill which focuses on the new skill or Concept in our case jousting and sure you are running a drill which is slow down enough to focus on good technique, but quick enough to get a lot of touches on the ball and keep their attention game like activity which incorporates skill or concept similar to the warm-up game. We're not getting into full-on scrimmage. Out here. We just want to put the girls in a game situation in which has everyone practicing jousting as if it were happening in the game playing a short Court game where players can only tip will help the jousting situation arise more often old / familiar skill demonstration. Since Jousting is not typically one of the first skills you cover you are probably a few weeks or a month into your season by the time this comes up your team should be familiar with their defensive positions by now so you can review defense at this time. Sighs tip coverage as this is related to jousting scrimmage, which incorporates both skills and or concepts now is the time you get to test out how well your players have grasped the new information you have given them by running a full scrimmage. You are allowing your players to get in the habit of implementing their new skills in a way that would naturally occur in a game. Not one that is forced or predictable cool down. Your players have probably put a lot of effort into the last 15 to 20 minutes of practice and need to ease into their normal state. Cooldowns do not need to take very long but should not be skipped. Also, it's very important to incorporate water breaks for the team. If someone is thirsty during a drill that you should also allow them to get water right away schedule these in but make sure your players know that they can get water at any time. This is a safety issue. This does not by any means have to be followed religiously at every practice. However, if you are struggling to create a schedule for your practice in this might be a great place to start some nights, you may also have skills, which do not easily work. Whether using this framework, for example, you need to work on serving and setting it can be hard to make these two skills. Mesh.	1.0

It's not like you just do the diet you lose weight and then you never look back.

Then you have the land-based EOD whereas we don't have as much as many people as you and so the current starters we have to do all of that.

Yes. Absolutely. I agree with you. It's kind of like a Hot Topic right now that a lot of people might hear and not know specifically what it is. So to break it down intuitive eating is a nonlinear approach to health and food and your overall well-being where the fundamental belief is that you are the expert of your own body. And so The traditional Health realm where we're constantly told to look outside of ourselves at the latest, you know Health Trends and gurus and food rules. What's good for you? What's bad for you intuitive eating asks that you actually just tune into the unique messages your body sends you and determine what is best for your health based on what you feel in your own body. So it's going to be different for every single person and again because you are the expert of your own body. Nobody can decide better than you what you really need. It's also a system that really helps restore a more empowered enjoyable and peaceful relationship with food and your body as opposed to having you work against and fight your body all the time and guys.	1.0
Yeah. So for to give you a little back story I was a Bull rider not a very good one. I wrote both, you know through high school and college and instead started and I guess I bought my Pro card in 96 anyway, and I rode around and got on lot of balls on the west coast. What it what had happened is I do to getting beat up and Andrew and stuff. I kind of had to give it up yum. I was only 25 or 24 when I quit But I threw getting on a lot of bulls out here on the West Coast. I became friends with Don Kish and getting on his balls all the time and go to go into their rodeos when I got beat up real good. The last time I guess 99 there. I he he called me when I was in the hospital and get offered me a job to come out and weld for it. Well, I was beat up and like I said, he beat up enough to where I can. I couldn't do too much like couldn't lift too much or do too much buddy buddy called and we had been like I said friends before need any dawn said would you like to come home and and weld for me? I'm trying to build this feed lots of these bulls. And and all I had to do is set in well, you guys are probably familiar with putting up pipe and cable fins. And and so I just had to set there and weld them the Milliron on the post to run the cable through and so on that that winter I came or well, I got hurt at Fort Worth. So it was about this time of the year anyway, and that came home and welded for dog. Well, anyway, it evolved into going to work for he and John crowning and and I work for the rodeo company therefore started in 99 and started, you know, discontinued helping Dawn with bulls and then really started getting involved with the horse part of it. You know while working for the rodeo company and then No.5 John offered me an opportunity to buy into the company and by the horses from the company which Saudi I did definitely at the time they they provided the horses and Don had two bullets on the ground. Right? Right. That's exactly right. So John own on the horses and then Dawn on the Bulls and then John also on the time of in cattle. I guess. That's anyway. and so through working around there for four or five years there and I started flanking the horses I guess and probably like oh three and then again just got an opportunity there and bought the horses and oh five and and then kind of well, I don't want this to sound wrong. But you know the horse program when I bought it and I'll five it was it was struggling, you know, there was I think there was a couple or three maybe horses going to the final and and and not a real real and I don't want this to come across like I'm saying anything derogatory. I'm not I'm not I'm just kind of trying to lay out the facts the breeding program. For the horses wasn't real organized. You know, there was kind of not sure what calls were out of what two mares. You know, there was some paperwork loss. You know, it's kind of a oh, yeah Club not a real not a real organized situation and not hey and not to say that I don't feel have some hiccups here and there today. I'm just saying, you know five it was in there was a lot of I did all the information wasn't there. But anyway, So then what I did is, you know first thing I did when after buying the horses sorted up the mayor's kind of got the you know, the mayor's that I thought were the best Mayors and certainly as we all know if you raise bucking stock you the ones you think that are the best at the you know, your first year or two into it, maybe they're not the best and and and then the one that you're that you don't breed all the sudden, you know later on you wished you kick yourself in the butt and think gosh. should have been breeding them are you know, she she was at first maybe wasn't the shiniest one in the herd, but you know, they stay hooked and they stay you know, they just stay solid and today that's the one thing I've learned now being, you know, whatever 13 years 14 years into this but one thing I have learned is the ones that are solid and consistent for me the mayor's that do that seem to be the ones that raised the better horses the that they've The Bucks in them. They're just they maybe aren't the most talented but they give it to you every time they might only be in 1819 pointer. But if they do that out of her time, that's probably in my experience that's you know, only 13 14 years into this pretty Limited in the horse industry because you know, you think of them other guys, I was talking about earlier. Oh, yeah, you guys that there's there's like guys like a cork. Oh they've been doing this 50 50 years, you know, so so when I talk about 13 or 14 Teen years. I might my experience is a little bit limited compared to those guys obviously, but in my limited amount of time here going back to what I thought the solemn are the ones that just give it to you what they what they can every time and and do something every time 1819 Point hoppers for me. Those have been the ones that have been the best moms, you know, and I don't know why that is. I wish I had a magic ball to look into and figure out why that is but But you know the the the ones that jump out there and just make your mouth water rank as hell one time. And then the next time maybe aren't as shiny. They the consistency it for whatever reason that that genetic trait of consistency doesn't doesn't carry on to their you know, their Colts have that same enemy. You know what they're just not consistent in any way so that send the Colts out of those.	0.0

I'm not going to name the same people twice, but as everybody knows who listen to this podcast and just you know mess with Over the years for rails my absolute favorite producer of all time, but I want to add some more people jazze PHA. I think I didn't jazze PHA definitely made definitely made a lot of Jazzy Fizzles production zaytoven, even though even though I kind of criticized him a lot of times because for the longest he did not make like different sound he beats he loved using those freaking Jamaican drums and it he will not do anything else, but they Toven, he literally like me Gucci Mane's career. I'm not even gonna lie, like he may go to man's career because those be they made for him like and all those freaking mixtapes albums that he put out. They told him made that sound fam. So like they told me I had to get his respect for the new wage trap sound in ATL like without a doubt that man is freaking amazing.

I have 12 years experience working in a VA with children with ASD. I thought I knew a lot however after attempting the Beast few times with no avail, I have been humbled I found myself built-in pigeon-holed into one small area of a ba in Wind taking the test. I realized that one area isn't all they test you on listening to the two of you used terms frequently and functionally has helped me so Thousands of dollars on exam prep materials but never got as much out of them as I have listening to real life examples of Behavioral principles.

No offense we do Casey and when erect you on the spot, but we have been doing it every damn week. Can you believe that? How did this happen? I mean, I think it's formed a habit at this point after 21 times. I mean, I'd usually 21 days for have it but like it's 21 days kind of I mean whatever like we make this happen. So I just want everybody to know that I accidentally scheduled this trainer. I have to work out with today and she's she does this thing to like hold you into the contingency like if you cannot Make it you still have to pay I was like I'm doing a podcast. She's like, can you treat our training sessions like your podcast because I literally just paid her to do it and I'm here with you guys. I mean, I'm not mad that I'm not working out. It wasn't intuitive. You'll get what I mean. Anyways, let's get started today's episode. I'm really excited because we have a guest who I absolutely adore and whenever I talk to her I feel so Zen. She's so cool my Great friend. I got to live with her for a year. And when I tell you all about her going to be jealous that I got to live with her for a year and our guest today is yell. Guden. She is a professional plant-based chef. And yeah, she was in vegan and culinary school when we lived together. So I got the sample everything and certified life coach who's now pursuing her master's degree in nutrition from the natural University of natural medicine and Portland, Oregon. That is most Fitting Place for her. I'm so happy. She's found. Her right environment. Yeah, L believes. We each possess the inherent wisdom necessary to take necessary to take responsibility for our own health and well-being. She empowers her clients to reconnect with their intuition. Listen to their bodies and find a more joyful and enriching relationship with food so they can stop looking outside of themselves for how to honor their Wellness needs and instead becoming their own best health Advocates.

Yeah, we'll definitely have to see him. Obviously, I've given my I've given my opinion out into separate podcast. I don't want to get too much into it, but it's I can definitely see your point. And I mean that's why at the end of the our last hop up cast. I tried to like kind of Bring It Down be like, all right, guys, you know what? Thanks your thanks respond because I mean we really do mean it. I mean it was super easy for us to be like me happy but instead with you know, we wanted to end it on really good note. So that's that's why we went that way because you know, Of like you it is pretty much just it is pretty much just like supporting respawn and you know saying all right, you know this this one's this one's a given I guess, you know for now because I mean there's not like they can do anything about it.	1.0
And the way they work together was great because if Derek didn't like something or he wanted to change something there were always on like on the same team. It was nice to see a whole team of people work together. There was again no drama. It was just like getting shit done.	1.0
Yeah, that's ahead. Because every race is different sometimes the things that too bad like you enter your dark places that it's not that bad some reasons of I'm thinking of the baby are too though. Probably the worst to me when I last year. So I just think back to that if I'm feeling really bad I think back to that. I think this really is not that bad but things could get much worse and that helps me. Yeah, but I also Tell myself a lot if I'm starting to feel crap, and I just want it to end. I just tell myself for this this time is going to pass. Anyway, there's will spend it doing something Kick-Ass something I can talk about later and that helps me keep going, you know.	0.0
Yeah.	1.0
So I've already gotten all the drawers that I feel I should have and I need to just, you know, see my limitations withdrawal. space not create more space so	0.0

Yeah, you definitely kind of gave it away. We can bring it up, but I know I'd rather not.	0.0
So that's just an idea for you.	1.0
And so I think I think we have a lot of fun along the way totally what kind of comes around goes around and I think that's what this is all about. Just a learning experience and educating both ways. And I think I think we're on the right track for that.	1.0
But it's yeah sloppy by both teams only really two teams in good form, obviously and Sheffield United the way they're set up to be fair to and was good. They were dirty the ref had a nightmare like give her out more bookings a shocking. Yeah, so but they sell really well and to go one-nil down of hard God. Here we go, but we grew into its second after we got we got better and better about and in the end we probably could have we could have won it but you think back to the mat chances though that Sheffield United out of what we look quite shake it the back.	0.0
I don't know what you guys I think we should leave climate change and sports for next podcast so that we have something to start out with. Yeah.	1.0
Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank. I'll be honest. I don't even know so first time because he always used to be	1.0

So do you enjoy it?	1.0
What when I cry now when you let down when you're in the dark, it's interesting because what I was going to say, there is like when I go for a training run, I generally go for a training run to go in unless in letting you know like out for at the speed session or something and then you know, nothing happens my brains just blank but like if I if I'm where I generally go for a run. That's the reason I like to go running is to going woods, but when I'm right See, I spend meetings far too much time going inwards. And so that's when I like to chat to you know, someone else that I'm racing with and like a hilly course is brilliant for that because on a hill that apart from the elites there aren't too many people who run them. So even though you're puffing up a hill you can actually get you know, a broken conversation going and generally you'll pass like once you 10 10 caves in Two arrays generally then sitting with all the people you probably going to spend most of the rest of the race with and so you get to know people pretty well. And so you can you know, like they can pull you out and you can pull them out and I remember my strongest memory ever was a guy that I was passing and he was out of gels and he didn't realize it he asked if I could take a gel out he got to the stage where he was so wrecked. That the concept of taking his pack off and being out of jail was too much and I gave him one of my gels because he actually run out and there was no way that he was 15 case the next checkpoint and that giving him in my gel made me run faster than if I'd use the gel myself. Yeah because you have someone yeah, and it's and it helped him and after the race he came and thanked me and said I wouldn't you know, you would have never finished the rice if it wasn't for that. Yell at that moment. And yeah, that's probably my favorite memory of racing, you know in all my running. So that's that's my thoughts are going in and out and that's what's so beautiful about an altar and Ultra is it's an entire life in one quick run. Really? Everything is Chandni you end up crying end up hurting you end up falling you end up cheering you sing. You don't seem like there's just Everything in there and that's that's why I love it. So well, I guess I about Lauren's music choice to is she likes rock and roll. I keep trying to convince her to listen to an alternative to rock and roll, but I haven't convinced yet. Well, I do like lots of different kinds of music, but I think you like the Techno stuff which I'm not such a big bet on to say if you scolding you talk idiom. Okay, I don't even know what this is when I'm running.	1.0
That's just yeah now Daisy really good. But yeah. So that's what that was. My that's my recap of why someone I-5 and lots of fantastic stories out there and so many inspiring people, you know, like like always at these events and I mean I tell you what the Finish Line party pretty awesome there. It's like you're in the forest Pine Forest / eucalyptus Forest nearby as well. You've got it come up this sort of Avenue of trees to the Finish. One and there's these big raging bonfires going you've got music pumping just a really good vibe at the finish line. And I just yeah, it's got the and the finish line and it's like lounges set up everywhere. It's like if I wasn't so exhausted I would have been able to participate a lot more when I Collapse on the lands for a bit and then I went and slept in my car, but it was yeah, it's worth it just for the video Finish Line. And party. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so there that's it. Awesome. Yeah. Well done cheese it. Yeah, that's another one down. And now I'm just going to recover and so yeah today what's next for you.	1.0
I mean that's a pretty heavy burden it is but you know, when that's again when this is all you're seeing, you know, and then I go back into my own family and I see the patterns of fatherlessness and if that's all you know it and that's what's normal, you know, so this is what all my friends felt, you know what I mean? It's set for the to now the two who knew their fathers. Love them. You know what I mean? Love them. They I got a lot of juice for them and I learned through their Actions, you know on how to parent like you said earlier actively like they was always around one of my boys is you know, you had four boys they let me times like you need a new you 16 need a car. I'm here. He was still cool with their moms at if it's something broke at their house. He would come through fix, you know, if they had barbecues he was still around, you know, and my other friend is his parents were still married. So, you know that that but his father wasn't was another one that was like, you know, I was like I ain't Because you just you get to see the living blueprint, you know of black father who specifically when you when your dad passed.	1.0

Yeah. I had a record deal before I booked my first movie A lot of people don't know that and so it was me and my cousin we had a group called wolf pack and we were trying to get after it. But that was the gatekeeper days. That was when you couldn't I mean it didn't you know right now you can just hit send and this out to the world and it is what it is and you know, they wanted I was kind of an Ali and his sense of now there's just hit movie out and we got this kid signing with deal but he's spitting up because we was more awesome like revolutionary kind of Dead Prez type of field and it was like nah, we we need the radio and I'm like, well, that's not me. So it's just got bottleneck that that you know at that at that point and I was young too. I was young little bit cocky. I guess you could say because I've this things I look back on like I remember sitting in cash. Now's office and he heard the demo we had he was like Ayo, I'll put you in the studio with primo and y'all do for joints and my dumbass goes now my man need to do the beach.	0.0

Yeah. Allotted to deal with that with that age, right?	1.0
Exactly. Well, that's the one thing I was kind of fearing was like cause you played a bit of the multiplayer to you kind of got you you kind of got them familiar with some of these people who are like Titanfall veterans where they were grappling and then once they got like to a certain speed you basically could just go around the map by sliding and sliding and jumping over and over and never losing speed and every time you do you use the grapple, right? So exactly like I think that would make it pretty hard for Apex just because time to kill is just so much slower in Apex and if someone's moving that fast it might be a little bit difficult true true about it.	1.0
So when I'm hand-washing I will take the plate for example, and then I'll grab just kind of a brush and under running water.	1.0

I like found pictures but like in a safe space and Corner showed her the pictures and then I went up to her later and I was like, so did you see what was on my phone when I opened it? It and she was like know what was it. Was it a pee-pee and I'm like hmm. It was just a PP. Nothing. Nothing else. Not me with said PP not my mom.

I'm like still crying over the story. So if you do this, that's just me, you know being a worse but it's just um, it's a varied it's an extremely touching story and it is painful when you lose a staff member. So I'm thinking of so you have this yellow day and and you have this celebration of her life in May but leaving up to that time. What? Some of the things that you incorporate into your day into your way of interacting with your human beings, right one of the things that I'll share mine first and then maybe you could share something that you do is this is a really challenging thing to do. It's surprisingly challenging but as you go about your day and you run into 7-Eleven for your you know Snicker bar, not that that happened to me. I'm just saying, you know, I go in there for nothing but healthy things but you run into 7-Eleven. You and you grab something and you're checking out right? Look that person in the eye. It's really hard. It's a hard habit to get into and when they say, how are you how's your day? You know oftentimes your think I got to swipe my card. There's people behind me and I got to kind of find the right change, but we get in the habit of not looking at people when we talk to them or when we're in front of them. And and when that happens, I mean, I just think it becomes we become more disconnected. Even though we're surrounded by people. And so I think that one thing that can help is to become connected. So it's a habit. I'm trying to get better at and I have you know it Ebbs and flows like sometimes I'm better at it than others, but I noticed that I remember back going back to 9/11. So y'all, you know, I've been on this planet a long time some of you are like, oh, yeah, I was too and that happened. I remember when that happened and it was a very strange. couple of weeks strange and that you know one we didn't see our planes in the sky for a couple of days, but then when you would pass random strangers, I'm going to cry thinking about this but um, I'm getting it together here when you were passed random strangers on the street. They would look you in the eye and smile and and greet you which is very it's very different. If you're in a small town happens all the time. If you're in a large city doesn't happen ever like never nobody talks to you. I mean, you just kind of go about your day or base having their little mental conversations and they're going about their day. But for those two weeks we were connected and we were a kind. derp	1.0

A question that I wanted to know and I think it's probably going to be different for every Rodeo guy. But what you said you buy most of your Bulls are all of them what you just bought some seen some dummy trips on what are you looking for? I mean, you know, you're not you're not competing with them. It doesn't sound like so what's the few quality traits that you really looking for in a good one? Well well Oh guys look at the air and kick and spin but then for for me that that I guess that's I like speed. I you know might Corey and I always round and round about this because you know, I like I said a little bit ago Mike Corey and I are good buddies and bikes been at Northwest bull man for years and and he's in the break over Bulls. He likes bulls that that break over and old knock your job. You don't hang around you've been hanging around on kiss so long, you got the same flavor. He does with the speed a little bit when they have that intensity and speed all I know I like him to kick. I'm not gonna happen. But you know, but you do look at you do look at this. That X does a lot. You know, there's a lot of guys that even in this day and age they don't care how they read.	1.0
Well, I mean I started thinking about gold from one entry point of view and of course gold would be much better money then feared money that we use today, but I've come to the conclusion that as many other people before the gold is not actually the best man at their Probably something the best money would be something like silver. So I think precious metals probably the best choice. So I'm not a Bitcoin Advocate and so on and like experiments like Bitcoin because they're free market experiences is a great deal of thinking that goes into this great creativity and what I like about it as a professor is that it gets people to think about economic mechanisms or the economic Concepts and so on. So this is all great about Bitcoin, but still don't think that Bitcoin will be good money. So I think the traditional monies that we had in the past gold silver still the best one. Sorry.	0.0
So I enjoyed it. Yeah, a lot of people complain about wiping the the high chair down.	0.0
That's great.	1.0
That's actually Grand Falls did In Gravity Falls was like if you were really into it there they put secret messages and stuff. They had like a lot of things actually at the end of the at the end of the show. If you were when they were on the bus, there's like a secret message and you pee decoded it. It said something and then a guy posted something on a store on his Twitter later and like a year later and it was like a whole scavenger hunt set up by the person through the show. So and then like it was interesting actually.	1.0

I wanted to stay out of this because how TI raises his family ate my concern and it ain't my business. However, I am absolutely a here for a larger conversation about how girls and women's bodies are constantly being policed. Now, I will always be bothered by the fact that we are so consumed and fixated on the sexual behavior and the bodies of girls and women and I mean by both men and women case in point how many times have you heard men and some women but mostly men say they don't want a girl because then they have to worry about her getting pregnant or they don't want a girl because they don't want to think about all the boys and men trying to have sex with her and someday it will It their attitude is based off their own personal experience. They knew there was a time when they weren't shit, so they didn't want their own daughter exposed to some Reincarnation of their ancient Indus. So before a girl is even born before she even gets here people already policing her body. Now we have to deal with that our entire lives as women. Not just for my fathers brothers or Uncle's women can be just as guilty I often say this when discussing racism and racial oppression. Ian the real unfairness of dealing with those issues is that the burden and responsibility to solve the problem is placed squarely on the people most victimized by it. So when we have these conversations about rape and sexual assault the conversation is solely centered around women and what we need to do to protect ourselves. There's certainly a place for that but who is having conversations with young boys and men about consent about respect about keeping their hands to themselves if you don't want some asshole boy dish. Affecting your daughter then use that same energy with boys that you have when you want to police girls and women about their bodies instead of telling boys and men and run through as many girls and women as possible. If you want girls and women to be treated better. If you want us to be respected. It's simple raise better men stay on bothered.

Okay. So let's talk about the first one. If you want to follow along with us, then pause the podcast and watch the two episodes and then come back and you can comment or let us know what you think about the episodes if we Didn't say something that you want to put out there anyways, so this episode opens with a concert which some of the episodes of Hannah Montana do. I don't know why a lot of the earlier ones. I filled it and I just it's confusing because that it opens with a concert and then I don't know it's like when was it filmed where was it filmed it because it seems like a legit concert, but it's not like in a studio like this a ton of people in the audience. What do you mean? It's not a studio? It doesn't look like a studio film space, you know, like okay, so, you know how like the difference between like for example the set at Rico's and then watching episode of like and emac like the the set is different. Like it looks like a legitimate set it like just like, you know what I mean? Yeah. Anyway, so I feel like the the concert at the beginning that's episode look like a real concert hall and that like a sound stage somewhere and a lot or whatever you think that you don't think are you saying?	0.0
I'll sometimes volunteer something to and then know that it's an invitation to ask how I'm doing and it's so basic and it's so pedestrian but you know, it's not going to be a new / that we increasingly don't talk to each other and interact in like ways to like really share data and really share truth and you know for me for a long time what helped is	1.0
Thank you. We're having a lot of fun.

I just want to read something that I pulled off your Instagram which I love Yeah, an intuitive eating tip. Okay, guys. Hey Doodles are stocking for us anything deeper than base level that you provide us. Casey will find I might know why I think I should have been a private investigator in my past life. I shagged stalker. Anyways, actually just reviewing the records like you had have to do an assessment, right? Yeah. I'm just reviewing the records they all right. She says order the salad if that's what you want what you're craving. Being in the moment, but don't consistently order the salad because you think you should or you think that's a good choice. Right? So like you're saying if you feel like it in the moment and you want it do it, but don't do it based on. Oh, I have to have a salad, right that's part of the diet. And that's kind of talking about MO is Casey if you know what I mean in the moment, right like you have certain things that in one moment. What are a mosrite a mozar when we talk about kind of the background information that Either increases or decreases the value of a certain reinforcer a Punisher in that moment. What do I mean? Okay. So let's say like my body is in a state of deprivation of having anything healthy in a while. Like I've just been on a at a tailgate all day eating crap in my body. That's the background information, right? So in that moment, that's the mo right like a salad or some things in establishing operation from my body is wanting that right. So that's what I'm going to have right then. But on another day, sometimes I just crave a freaking hamburger to bite into right like that's what I want at the time obviously a vegan one yell never real me moo, but in that moment what you'd still be allowed? Oh my God yells really changed guys Adam. I used to like cook salmon and privacy like I like I like She's gone. Everyone looked at those to make it a JB come to my house tonight and but one thing talking about like demos and what's valuable in that moment. Like one moment. This could be valuable for the next hour something else can and I think of really prime example and tell me if this would be intuitive to me. It seems that way. Yeah. Oh, but so when I initially didn't know what was going on with my hands and I was in hospital and it was a result of not having any circulation my fingers started freezing off and they were like going from Black to whatever it was people would say like what can I bring to her in the hospital? What can I bring? What can I bring in? The only thing I wanted was watermelon and I like watermelon but like in no way is that something like I typically crave or I want or like I need just watermelon and that was the only thing I wanted at the time and like I literally ate like probably like two watermelons a day like just cut up and and you know a few months post like my amputation surgery someone sent me. Me an article from the Harvard Business review or Harvard Business or I don't know my brain is going blank right now, but it was essentially about like the circulation properties of blood circulation properties of watermelon and how like they actually like sometimes recommended as a replacement for Viagra, which I actually take now as a medication three times a day and no I don't have erections because its original use was for blood circulation. But anyways, like my body was telling We got you want watermelon. You want watermelon now, do I crave it? No, but that's all I wanted at the time and I found that so fascinating.	1.0

You can do things with him to kind of keep him bucking like like that. You know, if the bareback rider they're not showing you what you need to see you. You still got the bronc riding, you know in the bull rule if the Bulls quit, you know, where do you go from there? You know, that is that's something that maybe some people listening. They may not know a difference to in the horse deal you guys Buck your mayor's as well as your studs and galvan's verses in the bull deal. It's only the Bulls. Well, absolutely. Yeah in fact T' are our best horses are mares. I mean, there's good. I guess I could I don't have numbers in front of me. But I would say the biggest percentage of our heard that's of the higher-end horses are the mayor's you know, and you guys can book them heavy bread too, right? Yes. Absolutely. You know, you don't want to Buck him right up to the end. But but like a good example of For a how our system earlier in the conversation I mentioned how I learned a lot from Ike's Anki and one of the things that I learned from Mike was with breeding young mares and then breeding your business. Let's face it guys. It's if you don't breed your best mares, you're not going to have good Colts. You're gonna have mediocre cult. So you gotta break your best married.	0.0
We agreed to do it last weekend and then just didn't happen. I forgot you forgot. Okay, bye didn't like maliciously forget. I didn't I like plead the fifth like I don't remember.	0.0
Yes, and that's actually how they found us. And we basically we were in like the jeans and t-shirt kind of thing and they saw it on YouTube they loved it and they're like, we need something like this on our type of show. So we're like, you know, what why not we can compete and we can do something like this that's super creative on the side and it's the best platform where we can just show what we're all about because there you're not in a ballroom dance competition there you're in just you're in a mix of just gorgeous dancers. And again, you're just super grateful of a be there and you look around just like the best hip-hop and contemporary dancers and Jazz dancers old from all over the world and credible. It's so it was so so cool. So that decision was super easy. We're like, all right. Let's try, you know, try something new. We've never done that before and we are so grateful we did and we did. Make it that far but like we definitely got great exposure from there's people started contacting us and recognizing us for what we do and that was the biggest thing and it was just again, we're just super grateful to be there.	1.0

I'm gonna say I'm gonna say teenager because a childhood is what makes someone you know, yeah, you're an idiot that growing as we go with the option to actually I would skip my childhood and go right into 18 because I've now I could mean yeah, I could see this being like I guess it depends on like your situation how you grew up to be honest, but if you had a As her to like, okay, I'm answering 17. But like if I guess if you know if your life was going to be good that you probably want to do it have a Teenage life. But if you know, it's not going to be good. Let's just skip that and go right to being an adult. You know what I mean?	0.0
So I don't mean I even I like Battlefield I've liked it for a while and it's one of those things that you know, one thing that I always. He's whenever I start up Apex Legends.

You know what I mean? Like well, yeah, it's like you can't hate them a little but but like yeah to go with you on that one too. I mean, there are plenty of marriages as we're tables hate each other and manage to make Yeah. Yeah, I think I'd want that but in this situation, I think it would do that because I mean like if you think about it, like if you if you live with your parents your whole life, you're not going to hit anyone like oh, that's the point. You're not supposed to throw this part of the second one, too. You'll be alone your whole life you like ever get a girlfriend or anything.	0.0
Pain that I feel like they have a significant influence on like the pricing side of things right? It's because that's what I'm wondering the operation, right? So in declaring company the parent company kind of controls the dislike the monetary side of you think any company or like any of the subs, right? So I feel like it's definitely an EA thing like even with a discount like the if you have like EA access origins or whatever you can get 10% discount, but even then that's like still a lot of money. Yeah. Spend on a gun skin that you probably won't be using for the full game. I think that they'd still I think that they need to kind of drop the price a little bit if they want to make more but did you hear that? They made apparently 92 million dollars. Yeah before the battle path. I was like who's buying stuff in the store?	0.0

Now that's that's yeah. I think I think I mentioned before you know in the last two years, especially I've seen the change in agents attitudes towards it but at the same time there's been a lot more businesses and people entering the industry and especially in Capital Cities. I think it's it's a very low barrier to actually enter the industry given you have these higher options or you know, I'm simplifying at a lot. So I'm being overly simplistic, but it is as simple as You can convince somebody to use you to style their home. You can do it tomorrow, you know, you can you can go to a higher company if you're in a capital city and you don't have to own anything. You don't have to actually outlay any costs other than your time obviously to build a business beyond that takes a lot more commitment and energy and cats and all those things. But you know in terms of setting up day one to test it's very easy to actually put your toe in the water if you were to go and like and I should also clarify that and say, you know, it took us a couple of Months before or phone calls and meetings before got our first job. So it's not as simple as that, but you know in I guess as you say young industry with low barrier to at least enter in the early years, it makes sense that we're seeing a lot of businesses pop up.	1.0

Well the sir. Bicoastal, so I started at Burma gooey and I end it at Eden. So the distance from biggity-boom Acuity or even is around 45 minute drive. I have gone further up the coast path / McGeary to town called narooma and down many which is kind of a little bit further than that 45 minutes, but that's probably the proximity because any further and removalist costs as you would know increase so I try and keep A bit in that Circle.

I've got talked about this last but I think it's actually it's a good segue since you mentioned the day or so and Tommy Boy situation. Now this new just came today, but the original story from a few weeks ago our boy Kanye West has been in a legal battle with Rockefeller and Emi who has been signed with since 2003 Kanye West with the Timothy to gain his ownership of his music and receive unpaid royalties, but now the news has come around that's mr. Kanye West has sold his soul and you know, I mentioned that he was with the Amana 2003 but his contract got extended in 2010, but according to this contract and I'm going to read what it says here and I can read the whole thing, but But verbatim it says at no time during the term. Will you seek to retire as a songwriter recording artist or producer or take any extended Hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing your musical career and the same basic manner issue in for sued such career to date. So what that means is that if Kanye loses his battle this man still can't retire like that's that's just wild this is wild. After all it is your trying to get ownership of your music Emi Rockefeller on it. You're trying to get unpaid royalties and they like well, okay no matter what happens. You can't retire bread according to this contract. So it's just another one of those situations where you're not reading fully what's going on or you are reading and you're just willingly signing over everything that you own and everything that you work for. These companies are shady man. And it just it sucks. I know that we made for The Kanye Kanye gun some wild stuff especially last year alone, but I don't want to hear this from anybody. I don't want to hear anybody trying to fight to get ownership of their music and then end up being a Slave at the end of the day because of some loophole or something that the artist did not look at before they actually signed a contract or signed the extension. So, how do you feel about this whole situation with Kanye?	0.0

Well, so yeah. No, I mean I'm not going to sit here and say they're the best ever but they were awful good like well one cult in particular I actually sold in the security and I think it was like 2012. Well, it's see I would have been 2012. I sold a horse. Pony man, he belongs to stay Smith now and he was he was out of that cult crop, you know, and then there was you know, he was by far the shiniest one. I mean, I guess I sold him to stay. I'm pretty sure it was 2012. He bought him there at the Benny Binion sailed, you know the bucking horse or a bucking horse security actually stays puts it on and and yeah, so Smith, I'd buck that colt there and Smith. Bought him and I think he's been to the NFR every year since like, oh, well, yeah, he's he was the shiniest one by far and then oh, I have a few other ones that are just really nice horses, you know that route. And so I think that first whole crop, but probably had well I'm going to say I can't I don't recall but I'm gonna say between 15 and 20 Colts to start with and I'm about I have when do you start those horses? I'm sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Wendy's start those horses, you know, how long is it before you start to know if you made the right breeding decision? Oh, well, sometimes a level five years, but for that particular to answer your question directly, the first part of the question was, you know, when do we start a I start dummy are blocking the Colts when they're too and and and I just dummy buckham once when they're to unless they just flat run off if they just flat run off. Then on my block him again, you know and do something a little bit different just but I bought them wants when they're two or twice. Like I said and then same when there's three and then so then when therefore I get people on them, you know, they start with their Riders. So a lot of them a lot of them horses have anywhere from two three, maybe four trips by the time they're four year olds, and then then it's time for a rider and and sometimes you know, they They you know, if you can see that they're pretty sure of their feet and their they have a really controlled style and they're you know, they're when I say a controlled style, you know, like the akkad. I got a pattern and they're like I said their feet are running room and all that's going on good and I feel confident. I'll stay up and not fall down with the guy. So I'll go ahead and put a guy on him with a couple of dummy trips and then and then the other ones, you know, there's those horses that I've Listen, I hate to admit it but there's horses. I've raised it. It took six or eight trips to before I felt confident to put a guy on it because it was all down all of ya and and generally that's the wild or wasn't it and going back to the breeding. That's when they're bred wrong. They're too wild and you know bucking horses. Sometimes the the Layman fan gives bucking horses a bad rap like they're there and I shouldn't that sounds wrong. I got I wish I could I was better with my words, but They get kind of a bad rap like her wild and yeah, you guys know that's that's not the case at all. Some of these some of these horses are really gentle and really good to be around and and and generally speaking is the more quiet they learn calm. They learned Focus. They are the better bucking horses. They are they you know, they don't have to be Wild Buck. We all know that what a maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not a bucking horse guy got on some back in the day and never never did any good at it? Didn't ever understand it but aside from just sighs. How do you how do you choose which which event you want to Buck those horses a cracker or saddle bro? Yes. That's a really good question for me. First of all, you're going to see when you dummy block them kind of what they do with their head. And when I was talking a minute ago about the control their body control while there while they're bucking with just a dummy on that gives you a little bit of an indication of what event to do to put them in. in butt butt For me, I found more of their mother. So if their mother could take the bronc riding and tolerated it and she liked it and bucks in it. The Colts in seems to do that, you know, tools will follow suit now that's not always the case but a lot of the time it is, you know, an in an unfortunately the way as the way the rodeo business is now with the shorts. Age of bareback Riders, sometimes you are forced to put Colts in the bronc riding that you're not 100% sure if it's going to work or not when you're first blocking them around but sometimes there's it works out beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't but for the most part you kind of got a number one go with their style number two kind of their mom and then third the availability of the riders that are there that day you have very many of those horses that you may be starting. In one event and then decide that they need to go to the other event, or maybe they do both events or oh absolutely. So so I have a horse named Capone and he's been in a far five times. I think or maybe six and his mom is out of one of our famous men as Raggedy Ann. Well when I first started bucking Capone, he was a bare back and he went to the finals like for three or four times and bareback, you know in the bareback riding.	1.0

I'm here. I just need some help. Yeah. Well, I realized that that that is helpful. I also understand that having a counselor or a doctor or those also like you have to have all of those components I think you yeah.

Right and the Indians could prey on that because they could just say well we'll keep them. He's a perennial All-Star will keep him for two years. We don't have to trade him to you but along those lines I'm also Thinking it's only a matter of time before another team gets in the mix or is leaked to be in the mix because that just drives it up even more. You know, if the Dodgers insist they don't want to include Gavin Lux. Well, then the Indians can leak to someone and say hey we've talked to the Atlanta Braves or the Cincinnati Reds or another team about a Lindor trade and and then maybe the Dodgers get a little more desperate. But you know, I also think having just I'm Just going to completely debunk everything. I just said I also think front office's don't fall for that stuff the way we all do media fans the public, you know, I think they have a pretty good grasp of what's really going on. And yes, they do pay attention to trade rumors and and National reporters and whatnot. But you know that they use that to check on things to get what the legitimate scoop is and not necessarily what's out there. So it's going to be interesting. You're right. You know how desperate to the Dodgers get do they really feel like Gavin Lux can be as good as Francisco Lindor and more importantly do they feel like he can be as good as Lindor right now. I don't know but I mean you look up and down that roster and there's like 15 to 20 guys. I'd have interest in if I was if I were the Indians, I mean, there are so many directions they could go but you probably need Lux in the deal to feel comfortable because this isn't just this isn't just like Find the best match and let's do it. This is overwhelm us enough that we feel comfortable going to ownership and convincing them to sell their franchise face of the franchise and you know, probably sacrifice some season ticket sales and some fan sentiment knowing that hey you might be a better team and you'll certainly be a better team long-term Beyond 20/20 one. But like this is going to sting even if you get a really good return even if you quote unquote win the The trade and all the people who love to get a handout letter grades 10 seconds after a trade happens for some reason, you know, you're even if you win those and you get an A-Plus like it's still going to hurt at the Ballpark at in the ticket office. So you're going to have to be overwhelmed. That's why I think Lux probably has to be in the deal no matter what even if you to a mean like in a vacuum like Dustin may + Alex Verdugo + Chris Taylor plus Joc Pederson Plus Like Max Muncie is an amazing Hall. But like I still think I still think it's got to be Luxe. I still think you need that Marquee slam-dunk piece. And I think especially Indians fans by now are probably saying it's got to be Luxor.	1.0

I was actually surprised to see this as a purple because much like skull town and much like slums. There's a lot of houses here. So not only is it a lot of houses, but it's also a high tier area.

Stood in the statements you were making about Syria being a suit serial Builder and I've heard it said in the past and I believe this was amongst commercial users that 90% of the things that are built are built by a one-time owner. I don't know that I could substantiate those statistics at this point because that's probably 10 to 12 years old in anecdotal at best. But are you seeing that as kind of the Difference Maker it seems like that's what picture you paint. That's the Difference Maker between a large industrial users is that they've got the capital in the know how to plan? Whereas these commercial users that are in there from one time. They don't have the capital to know how or the care because the savings aren't large enough to go into it with a mentality of we're going to prefabricate. We're going to modularize we're going to do off-site construction. Is that fair to say?	0.0

And that's great that you've written a book about fatherhood because you know black fatherhood is something that's that's not discussed enough or at least not discussed in the context in which you're discussing it like a lot of times. It's always the conversation is always about what black fathers aren't doing right as opposed to this is how you manage, you know, being a black father and what that means. So you speaking to it from that perspective I think is probably I'm sure Go help somebody hopefully yeah. All right. Well, good luck to you Cowboys. Yes. Okay. Thank you for having me.

I realized that people wanted their In properties furnished and so I had to then go and every job I got where I needed Furniture. I would just buy for that house and it has just accumulated over time, but I don't have any higher options. I think Canberra is probably the closest and that's 3 hours away.

We were just friends platonic like we would just I was the homie and then we started dating, you know, we kind of dating but then like after about a few months like six months ironically enough. I was the one that was like we probably shouldn't date. And she was like, wow, I was like yo you about to do your thing. I'm about to do my thing. I really love our friendship and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that and I don't want to like you're supposed to you were young like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't want to resent you. I don't want you to resent me and so we kind of went back to friends and then a few years after that we kind of just Kind of grew apart, you know a little bit I moved out here to LA and and then one night. I'm in the club and I'm going to the bathroom and this girl is like oh, you know my homegirl Keisha and I'm like Keisha's fight me and she was like, yeah. I'm like call her.

Yeah, and it wasn't until I was 12 that I went to this Born Again Church. That was Evangelical and you know now looking back I believe that's when I got really messed up and some really toxic thinking and toxic beliefs and fear fear fear fear.	1.0

It's it's just a video course with me talking about everything. I know about vibrations everything that I taught here in Moore from A to Z in a comprehensible way lesson. The lesson lesson I break down every concept video by video and You will be able to learn just everything just about everything that I know and they're in a very organized way. So you're able to put together the pieces and raise your vibration yourself. So, thank you.	1.0

It's unbelievably slippery slope though.	1.0

I want to see one of those now you don't and so bad so It was really cool because you know, he would set the camera down and then guess who gets to play with it me true. So yeah, so I was like, I always saw him with a camera and I looked up to him so much man. Like you have no idea how much I looked up to him and he kind of kind of did was that father figure for me for a while and he passed away and no one but anyways besides that he was just he was a very much an influence on my life. So I knew that he was he was successful and and his career in his field. So I kind of saw that and kind of took the leap forward as well.	1.0
No, but I also I mean guys who are two months from free agency and don't have much trade value. I don't put that on them. I will say the one other one that made you scratch your head at least was last year with trading ideas because I don't think people like that but that wasn't like especially at the time because people didn't really know about Jack Bauer's and he was a top under Prospect like that wasn't what I don't I cannot think of an example ample where they made a trade and it was like, oh my God, they get host. What are they doing? Like you usually have a pretty good feeling about the deal at the moment and it's going to be interesting because like the Dodgers of their their roster and their farm system are loaded. There's so much opportunity, but I don't know it's going to be if they don't include Lux. Is there a way for fans to be no?	0.0

There are some actors that you feel like you personally know because they play roles that remind you of folks in your family and your neighborhood or people you went to school with. So in 1999 the movie The Wood came out and it really is one of the most underrated movies because what made that movie special. Is while it was based in Inglewood those characters could have been coming of age and Detroit Chicago really anywhere now Omar Epps my guest today on Jamel Hills and I'm bothered has been in a few movies that are just like that from Jews to Love & Basketball, even the program he has had an incredible career that has spanned some years. He joins me today to discuss not just his career, but the book he wrote about black fatherhood his days as a former MC in case y'all didn't know he used to spend on the mic and Why we've never seen him and Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin in the same room now, but all jokes aside. Very pleased to welcome Omar Epps. He's up next. Because I'm such a gracious host especially to guess whose work. I've admired for a while and you know people who I get the sense even though Omar you and I don't know each other that well, but you know, I fuck with you, right? So because of that, of course, I'm gonna open with something that I'm sure you have a lot of thoughts and opinions that plays right to your strength. Let's talk about your damn Cowboys. Ha ha ha. Wow. I know what a what an opener. Yeah, like real Graces of me to like bring up something. I'm sure right now for Cowboys versus everybody is a sore subject. So where do you stand on Jason Garrett? Because a lot of is to some degree typical after a loss that people immediately direct all their anger and frustration at the coach. So that's kind of common but with Jason Garrett is just has always felt as if there's been this love-hate relationship between him and Cowboys fans who are expecting more you always expect more but in particular this year, so what's your assessment of?	1.0
Honestly just to finish with you the past few weeks on just yeah, I don't have a time. It's called in fines just finish it and hopefully enjoy it. Let's go I could of course. I am not they don't get caught up in English applied to the stuff that I guess I did a bit easier and I did push it but I have to say I didn't do that. I didn't enjoy it because I was so focused on my time and my pay is looking at my watch. I would rather be somewhere in enjoy it. So yeah, hope you just to have a bit of fun. Yeah cat other people it seems in one piece. It's funny how I mean I'm guilty of this massively.	1.0

So the other day, I'm at Sacramento muhittin hip and kind of making shoot forward and had a little bit of a different day that bull usually right there to the right. You like he'll go like a round or two right there to the right in the gate and then he'll jump forward and go back a left generally, but the other day, like I said, he hit he hit his hip and made him shoot forward and then he kind of had a kind of a I don't know. I didn't love these is move before I turn back. But once you turn back then he was fine. But yeah that hit so that will Omaha. I like him. He's a good boy, but he came from a friend of ours up in Oregon a guy named Rusty Gorham raised that boy. So the in their sure proud of them Rusty and Lisa are real proud of that bull. So that's cool. Cool for that deal back here. $3,500 will 10 Bingham was like 93 on them at Kennewick or something. Wasn't he? Right? Yeah. Yeah at Puyallup at the yeah. Yeah, and then his brother Tyler at Spring Road. The only time that Bulls been rode the last couple of years. Other than that the PBR deal, but Tyler Kimball throat. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Hi, you know good good good boy, the 93 I think was a stretch that was quite a bit of points. But but but he's a good-good bull and in back to our point is for for what works for our business and and I'm not saying that works for everybody. But for what we're doing it, it works better for us just to buy the both, you know, so I can see the guys that raise them like the pages I watched. They're Bulls at Sacramento. Watch what they do on the sales. And if not and how they do their their their business and I can see why they do what they do. It works. They block like hell and they sell it for lots of money. So they're doing they do you know what works for them? That's good for exactly. What so what about to you can kind of answer this in the two-part question but like us fraternity guys and stuff what kind of segregate our bulls and stuff and then I take it rodeoing, you know, it's um rodeos may have ample amounts of pain some may not Are they are they just in general population like at your house? And then how many how many trips a year roughly. We you put on a bull? Well, the first the first part of your question is is you nailed it. There's there's a lot there's rodeos have the facility that to split them up pretty good. But then there's a lot of a lot of rodeos at don't have that, you know the kind of facilities. You need to split them up a whole bunch. I'll tell you how I try and make them live. And and you guys being bull guide, you know that there's sometimes you just can't make mixes. There's some mixes that just don't work. They just don't like each other. We know we all know that kind of force them through it and get them to get along but for us how I try and do it as I pay them how they fit on a truck. So in a cattle pot sets of 6 is I got using I got a couple sets of fours or like a set of for a set of three got to be the nose and the back step and then sets Six is on the top, you know the top and the bottom decks. So and then that also fit for the pins that we have in our house, you know, we have pins that are about all half acre lots maybe from half an acre to maybe one acre lot and and that's plenty of room for them.	1.0

Okay, so there is not that big a town. In fact, I could I think I could I could run around it probably in half an hour to an hour. So imagine you yeah, really go. I imagine that you've read every single Street in Bruner itself. So do you have it? Okay. No, I don't run in town. I've been out of town. Yeah, I don't like running around the town streets. So I like it when it's nice and quiet. So I do a lot of writing on the outskirts of town and along the dirt roads and things like that and you have a favorite course out there or do you just pick something different every day? What I am a creature of habit. I do have my few different routes that I do that my favorite. Is this the Buddha chill illegal trial, which is hardly anyone seems to know about but it's a beautiful little The trail part of the seemingly multiples went along there, but it's nice that you I never see anyone there. It's beautiful. It's undulating. You can see Mount French lie because of the distance of most of its shaded which is unusual for around here. So that would probably be my favorite I can if I start from home you can do that 30 case I suppose those trails. And then next next year I'm going to do the 200 bomb idiotic. Well, maybe the plan. Various lists the various. Wa very nice. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, beautiful try. I'm terrified about Well, I can't say I saw Iran maybe 60 or 70 case on that trail last year. And in that time I think I saw three or four snakes are quite a while snakes on that trial. But yeah, I see a lot of things here. So yeah, that doesn't yeah, but look the run like along the beaches and so on. I just yeah, 'best of Vine country. That's Show this the whole of the logistics of what bothers me the most is getting there and all sort of all that out, but there will get there and you know be an experience. That's for sure. It's nice baby. Sorry, sorry good Daniel night and you go.	1.0
Well, hopefully it's just good timing and now running slowly introduces a little bit more anyway, so yeah not really care.	1.0
Now that's the yeah, that's that's confusing. I mean cuz it's almost like a Titanfall 2 situation. But now it's Battlefield that's Battlefield has turned into the TitanFall 2 of the of 2019 because it's like who's going to be playing. I mean, I'm sure there's millions of people who picked up Battlefield 5 and they might even still have it on their fan base for sure.	0.0
Let's see interior defense Supply and Kaylin Saunders. I do not see him. Let me go through quickly through the draft. I didn't go through every name. So let me deal with check really quick. Kalin Saunders went off the board to the Indianapolis Colts at pick 89 at pick 89.	0.0
Yeah, and I mean, it's just I feel like another reason is I've dropped there so many times now there and there and like the wetlands and things like that. I've dropped so much that I'm so used to the layout of it. I feel like I have that that first like hot Drop if I was going to hard drive anywhere it would be there and then obviously number one but it's like those are the places that I'm so comfortable with that. I feel like I know the angles I know the corners and I really I just like the setup of it and then if you get in a pinch using that zip line across the tooth, you know the to He's or whatever is really nice because you hit somebody just right.	1.0

Yeah, I mean I understand for her classmates as a little different but again, like you said something supposed to be that way. Yeah.

Well, I think what we've noticed and talking when owners and studying. This is just a lack of vision at the onset of the project if owners and contractors alike are coming into a particular project opportunity and they're aligned on what possible from an off-site standpoint that really bodes well for maximizing the prefabrication or off-site potential on the project. It's I think it's what works hard as if there's a basic project that gets design and then a contractor or a contractor in a designer than says all right, what part of this can we can we manufacture off-site since having that alignment going in from the beginning with owner the engineer and a contractor all aligned saying this is this is really how we want to achieve this any kind of modular design any kind of prefabrication off-site construction really originates in the planning period of the construction process, right?	1.0

Yeah, so I have another question about your training. So you spend a fair bit of what I know about you spent your run by feel you don't really tape up but and you somewhere along the line you recover. I don't know how so you've obviously got a bit of a Natural disposition or maybe just from years of running until dropping pretty decent base, but do you ever have any major troubles with the engines?	1.0

So we knew three days before. So again, we come in like we're setting up for the meet and greet Bashas like iron shirt were obviously turning on the office and funny enough. It was on live TV, so that was great. So watching the office and I'm like crap, you know, I have to go to this meet and greet right now, and I just really To finish this episode. It was like so good. I think it's the one when Jim proposes to Pam or something like that and I'm like, oh my God, this is the best like so good. Just want to watch it and we're like, okay, whatever. We'll just we'll go on Netflix later and like finish watching the episode. I'm like, okay, so we go to the meet and greet. And Sasha Farber turned around to me and he's like, oh my God Meredith is here. I'm like, what? Wait, who's Meredith? Yeah. Wait. What do you mean? He's like Danny Meredith is here. I'm like, what are you talking about? I turn around and she's standing right behind me and I'm like, you're in my living room.	1.0
Yeah, so, I mean that's how a name gets tossed out there. I don't know the veracity of the report that was was out there. I mean if you look at the facts. If you traded Lindor and Clevenger separately you get so much more than if you treated them together, you could find a team desperate for starting pitching trade them Clevenger and get a top prospect. And then some you trade Lindor and Clevenger together and it's like yeah, you're gonna get a huge haul but you could get a huge haul for both of them separately. I think the the more realistic thing first of all as I've said they're going to go to Clevenger and Bieber at some point in the next month or two and say let's talk Extension. I think there's a better chance Beaver signs agrees to something then Clevenger does but as we said like Clevenger was a late bloomer. He's about to be 29 years old. It's going to hit free agency at about 30 right before his 32nd birthday. I don't know if it seems going to give you that. They're not going to give you the Gerrit Cole Stephen Strasburg type deal at that age. So it's and you gotta prove yourself in the next three years. So it's a little riskier. So maybe he signs. Maybe he doesn't if he doesn't And I think he does become a logical trade candidate a year from now not the type of thing where like Trevor Bauer where they really wanted to get rid of them. But you explore just like they have with tons of other guys, but I don't think it makes much sense to trade him. Now. I don't think it makes any sense to include him in a Lindor deal to sweeten the pot. I think you could dangle kluber in that package certainly maybe a younger picture. But yeah, I think you keep them separate and then During Bieber or the reason why you feel like whether you trade Linda or not, you're still going to contend and be a threat to win the division and make some noise in the playoffs.	1.0
He's crazy, but they do not know you don't know how we played left wing of gone Jarvis.	0.0
So well, it's been you know initially like in the in the heat of it Josh and then the heat of it like as I'm leaving the pitch back, you know back in Austin. I'm on cloud and Cloud Nine I go through all the steps, you know, it's important for me to be persistent with all investors including James and initially it was tough. If it was very tough because that it felt like a lock when I walked off of the off of the stage. Yeah, and so initially it sucked and worst case scenario of everything bust that we've got a whole lot of other great things going on for us. So we're not you know, I can't I'm not going to dwell on that because I'd still be stuck there and not making the progress we're making right now.	0.0

I think because over the years. I've managed to beat my body into submission, but it does what it's told but I've been I might not have been running Ultras went. 13 years or whatever, but I've been still running for a long time and I think that counts for something and I do strength training as well. Which for me everyone's different. So a lot of others don't do it and they seem to get by fine, but strength training really works for me and it helps me with my endurance. Maybe I am a bit Lucky in a way that I can recover quickly, but I tend to think not I don't think it's love. I think it's just persistence and just at the cumulative effect of Many years ago breathing. Yeah, I'm lucky. I don't really get major injuries. I had had hip adductor tendonitis in the past. That was a number of years ago now and I couldn't mind for the good part of a year. And that was awfully I do have since playlist. I pretty much always have them but that's a pain I've When it's to make peace with I can handle it, that's about it. All right, I mean after a long run on the weekends, I do get sore the next day obviously, I don't walk though the best but I do bounce back pretty quickly. But again II tribute that to to making myself a move again quickly if I sit down I don't do anything for a few days. I feel terribly just yeah, although keep moving.	1.0

It's a tractor. No, but like the big the core of this game. This is what was so important and what I was scared of which I think is easy to fall into for a game like this is that it takes itself. So seriously, and it doesn't have the gameplay to support it. Do you know what I mean? Like here? I can't tell what's more interesting like the graphics and everything going on or the gameplay? Because if you just have Graphics it's like just eating whipped cream, you know versus like having the gameplay behind it. There's like A cake there that's enjoyable to yeah, you know what? I mean? It's like you need cake you need cake before you put on the process might like to I don't know too sweet. I couldn't think of another example. Okay. How about this? Let's rewind rewind rewind it's like having a chassis of a car but no engine, you know, like a lot of games fall into this, you know where it looks really nice and I just like Wolfenstein falls into this. I think a lot of other games I can't think of but like games like Wolfenstein basically they look so nice and they have like really cool vibe to it. But then underneath the gameplay gets repetitive and is boring but it seems like with respawn there. They always put mechanics and gameplay first and then everything is periphery which adds to it.	0.0
Yeah, it might ease Souls water wet.	1.0
Yeah. So yeah. So once I got out of the military I came to Utah my parents live in Utah and it just again not super internet e days and so and I guess I didn't feel very good. It was strange even having been in the military and having gone some of the places that I went, you know, Kuwait and strange places. I still had kind of a problem feeling like I could just go like to LA. And live by myself and go to college they're like, I didn't feel comfortable with that partially because I was married at the time and I know for me I would've been fine being broke sleeping in a gutter going to college in LA, but I was married and so I had somebody else I needed to take into consideration. And so I felt like I couldn't like drag her along to do the same sort of thing. And so the kind of the compromise I think was moving to Utah to Salt Lake where my parents lived and go into the University of Utah has actually had from all from everything. I'd heard a pretty decent little film program moving from Idaho, right? No, so I was in England. Oh God. Yeah. So yeah grew up in Idaho. But then when doing military like left, Idaho and never looked back and and so I was yeah, I was stationed in England for most of the time I was in the in the Air Force and so it's moving back from England back to Utah which I like I did take the short route from Idaho to Utah for sure anyway, but yeah, it kind of took the long way around and so yeah, like I decided I'm like I'm gonna go to film school and you know, like I think Film school is definitely a conversation that could be had another day. Is it worth it? You know, there's a lot there's been a lot of talk about that like, you know, sometimes people say the best film school is just you know doing it, you know, and like I actually don't disagree with that especially in today's world. Yeah, especially today's world is when there's so much online you can read about like there's basically just textbooks online you could you have access to like every movie ever made like you can do a bit of self film school and like equipment like honestly, you know phones, you know, you can grab a phone. It's got a camera on it you can Start you can start doing stuff much easier than you could back when I started in school. There's more content and filmmaking today than there has been ever ever actually seen as such a crowded like this is the stuff I want to do stuff as a kid and like part of me wishes. I was born about 20 years later so I could really taken advantage of all this like at a younger age sure.	1.0

Like there are so many positive benefits that we get from moving our bodies and the second you make exercise about either a punishment for something you ate or simply for the pursuit of weight loss. It just takes the fun away and if we just remove that from the equation and treated exercise as a celebration of what your body we can do in a celebration of having the ability to even move your body, which is also just a privilege in and of itself how would shift your relationship to movement like, what would you do differently? You know, I also see people thinking like we live in like the no pain no gain culture right where it's like people think that you need to feel depleted and exhausted and like you can't move after snack Orangetheory. Yeah, right like okay calling them out, but it's true. It's like Who made that rule like why can't exercise be something that energizes me and that I like just enjoy but then I can have enough energy for the rest of my day. So maybe I don't go off because of in hiring me.	0.0

But I mean, let's talk about the level of padding things like multiple people associated with Move I've gotten Petty with fans to a level. I don't think I've really used to I mean, I think the only thing that comes close is like Steven Universe, but like I heard that been in what kind of aren't it was a Steven Universe or Voltron Voltron Voltron where you know, there was a huge class between the Show creator people of people involved with the show and fandom and they actually kind of went back and forth with each other, but that was later. So like before Teen Wolf, I don't really remember that happening. Often enough for people to find out about it.	0.0

So hopefully that will be launched soon and I guess going back to my be the overall online store idea because I've seen other ones where similar sort of things but bedroom packs around the furniture more than just the the kind of the lighter or the smaller pieces and look. I don't have any experience at all. But my initial response to when I see those is I'm a little Little about how well they would actually do not because it's about I think it's a great idea, but I often wonder what I look at those, you know, some of the prices for the full living room pack or Furniture whether there's actually much demand out there and and given that there's actually a lot of competition as you say retail is can is struggling on this at the moment. I imagine that's the case online as well and I guess it in an of a selfish it could be a time business, but it's kind of sitting as a second priority to for the most of These staging businesses as a second or complementary part of their business. So I guess I'm just wondering if somebody has no idea at all how well these things are near you've just said that you just received quite well. Have you found that it's something that buyers are all I guess. What do you think about others who are doing similar sort of things but in a Furniture space, do you think that they're actually going to be something that given our industry? It's actually received were Lords in demand or or my kind of missing the point a bit.	1.0

It's just funny how many we get you get the same parkrun photos every week and it's just like my feed gets flooded you park on yeah.	1.0

So yeah when I watched it the third time I took these notes because I just thought and this is my point and I think what I do this when I read this, it'll make my point of what I was talking about with Monique and Monet. There was like the honey like the set itself was just gorgeous the honey dripping off the shelves brilliant attention to detail the design. I said the design in general the sweetest. I probably the sweetest hot spot.	1.0

It's okay. Ricky really get it tells you had to and I like and then I go actually maybe right let's go. So we started going like to follow them. We were like, okay, let's not get too close. Now, we're gonna hopefully Palms so I don't know if they want to follow them. But you know, Ricky told us watching so we're walking and we stopped for sometimes like we're stopping. We're like, okay, we're going to stop here watched you and they move and keep going and then at a point I go there they are. ER let's go there they're walking and the lady goes to us and she goes that's not funny. Don't do that. I was like, what are we doing?	0.0
Yeah, I think so and I think that's where what like your strong suit is like like you get story like you have all sorts of great ideas and where your story sounds really comes out is in Your visuals like I you know when I give you a signal we're going to shoot and I have the storyboard and I'm like, I think it's going to look something like this like you're interested like okay, where are these characters heads out where they're doing and you shape your lighting and angles and stuff kind of around that like whatever. I might not have already thought about that's where you jump in. You're like, I want to have, you know a dark back here because you know Duality or whatever, you know, and like that's that's a, you know, a huge part of the storytelling as well as well as the place where you Excel that I do pretty much nothing with is, you know, Partnerships with Brands stuff like that you're able to I mean, it's at the moment. We're still working on our funding but at the moment, it seems like the majority of its going to come from you being able to talk to these Brands they like hey, here's how making this movie can help you guys out and exchange for you to give a little bit of money to actually make it. Yeah and like so far it's looking like we're gonna get a bit of money out of that and that's something that I would not be able to like, that's not I'm not I don't really create content for Brands other than it might like my day job, but I don't sell that content to help make it.	1.0

I would actually allow you to have those Twizzlers now and there is an interesting reason why because intuitive eating believes that when you put foods off-limits like when you create hard rules about what you can and can't have what's happening on a on a instinctual level as that, you're just actually creating a stronger desire to have I've got food, right? It's like the classic kid with the cookie jar situation.

She is such a soul and I know that like every single person is going to look at this interview and be like another mom saying it's going to get better and everything's going to work out. She's different. She's different like she has been through and the advice of like don't take advice from people that don't that was the best. That was the best thing I've heard because there are so many people in my oh, I'm sure oh my God, there's a lot of people that have input on your life. But but you don't really really like them and really have no idea what you're going through. In your personal life. Yeah, so if they don't know if this is a good quote if they don't know you personally don't take it personal. There. It is. Alright bang. So this is like kind of funny because we just had a like deep discussion and now we're going to talk about sex. So we're all over the place. Yeah. I mean honestly, we just this is a shit storm, but we're doing our best but we these questions are actually kind of amazing and there's also a story that we can share. Yes, that's us Also, it's also just horrifying. All right. So, um, we're not announcing and everybody's in everyone's Anonymous a lot of girlfriends contributed So, yeah, thank you to our girlfriends. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks ladies. So the first question is do colleges actually have sex parties or is that just in the movies? No, at least. I'm not any I know about and I am I probably would not ever want to go to that because that's a little scary. Yeah. No, I mean I've never really heard of that. I've never had the invite. Oh God. Yeah. No, I haven't had an invite. I have heard and sort of maybe seen some weird things but I've never like I think the closest thing to a sex party has been like seeing people in a club like just all touching each other and really having yeah, like literally having sex like, oh my God this greatly. Yeah, so like, okay like that's all but that's not even a sex party. That's all I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really know a little bit more private about my sex life. So saying this is like weird for us to talk about. Yeah, I well I thought it would be we thought it would be funny. So yeah, I think it's hopefully just in movies or if like if you're in a public school Define sex party orgies. Yeah, like I don't really like her but cut in my nose. Yeah. I mean maybe some people do I think if you go I'll ever Arizona or I think it was those big crazy schools. Like we went to Suffolk. I was still in school in Boston. Yeah. I went to school in Vermont and we did not have that experience. No, I think I think that's just in the movies girl. I think that's a little let's all pray together that it's just in the mood. Let's pray. The next question comes from one of my girlfriends and I think that it's just like such an amazing thing so should body count be a topic of discussion in relationship. Oh, I think if somebody asks your body count, they should be prepared to probably not be the happiest because if they're asking their Curious and they're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I mean Yeah, or they just want to know so that they have it against you without saying they want to hold it in you know, but I'm also the type of person I'd ask because I don't care I've asked every not that I've dated a bunch of guys because I haven't but everyone I've pretty much been with. Oh I was asked to I've said how like what's your number because I like especially people I've dated because what am I saying? I've had like one serious boyfriend but with Cody I've asked him and I it's nothing I would ever hold against somebody no. I'm not at all unless if your number is outrageous then that's a little questionable but it's definitely something that just is like I'm just curious like it's not that I'm an insecure person. It's just that I just want to know want to hear how naive I am. This is how it this is how bad well this was also a few years ago. I was still in college my old roommate Grace her and I were like in my bedroom and we were talking one day and she goes what's your number and I literally was like nine seven eight eight five three, and I don't know that's not even mine or telephone number. Yeah, and I started saying My telephone number and she was like no. No, she was like you idiot like your body count and I was like, oh I was like, I don't know. I've never thought of it. I don't know why I don't think of it all that much and I think that's probably just because it's not something that's like a game-changer in any of my relationships because I've never really been with someone who's like slept with hundreds of people saying yeah, but that's that and if someone but I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be interested. I would not be interested. Yeah like I'd be like, okay. Well, obviously If it's if it's over, I'm not going to say like what my number is or like what not my number but what like my ideal number and a partner is but if it's over a certain amount then gotta go because like that's sorry. Yeah. I'm like flexible about stuff like that. Like I know that a lot of people our age like sleep around and experiment and do not like different things. Yeah. So that's never bothered me. We have one question or not. Really a question. It's actually a story from one of our girlfriends. And shoot I was looking through. Okay. Here's Tiffany's. Well, that's not even her real name. So I guess it's fine. Oh God is a lot of Tiffany's there's a lot of Tiffany's in this world. Okay, so shout out to this bitch.	1.0

This is just about making the world a brighter place for other people. And by getting people to see the good inside themselves.

We did this real day. We're doing this to gear up for you today. So, please please please as you share it this episode or share talk about this with your teachers share those ideas with us, you know, if you put something about kindness on social media that is related to to making the world brighter tag Didi and I in it and we want to hear your ideas to in. Yes, yellow day. Obviously, it's not my personal ID at all. It was it was a team idea that we started at our school. Obviously the books are my ID. And what I've done with the so far has been a culmination of ideas. I've learned from people. So yes while it's tied back to my name. I guess I don't want it to be that way at all. I want it to be a worldwide Global thing. So ours right is it's ours and I want those ideas to be spread and shared. So we love I say we because it is a community people that work this together. We love Of hearing ideas of ways to make make the world a brighter Place awesome.	1.0
Yeah. Absolutely. And I think I should goes really hand-in-hand with we're just talking about with with criticism and the piece of advice I have is get over yourself. Like if you have an ego and you don't listen to what other people say and you don't look at yourself and be Be honest with yourself you're not going to do as well. If you if you can look at something you've done and be like I can do this better instead of like I'm awesome. Everybody bow before me you'll get better because that means you're open and willing to learn that's great.	1.0

So gotten all the people in La it's a little bit Hollywood its type. So when they took up their shirts there you'll really like looks like a model like intimidating. I was taking off my shirt back here. I'm not even that Behave, but I didn't dare to think it took my shirt off. But in any way it's more glamour. It's a little bit. Yeah. It's like I don't know. It's Hollywood. You know, you get what I'm talking about? Yeah. So after I went back, I applied it. So I'm my our pastor was relocated in La so there's no sense to go to Amsterdam anymore.	1.0
Yeah and you are I mean because it Dave did a very similar sort of thing with me kind of helping helping look at who we are and distill down what we might be good at and help you support us in those ways. And by the way, Like we're not going to just you know be all about Dave and never let you hear from him. Dave will probably on here somewhat regularly. I think yeah, he's got a lot of knowledge is good guy. He's fun to talk to he's gonna be our first guest as me first for our first guest. But so I mean, yeah you like you he hoped to still you down into a DP and then the result of that was you start actually D peeing on the short films that we worked on together, right? You know, it was two weeks after I started by two weeks that we did the 48 Hour film project in Salt Lake two weeks after Drew started and we won and we well we won the audience award which I like for me. Okay, I think the most important like I want to hear more about the audience than judges to be completely honest.	1.0

So embarrassed right now. It's one of those things like I found myself doing a lot. I'll go all week.

So scrub that out wipe down the handle, you know, maybe you need to go a little bit deeper and actually clean the shelves the walls whatever you need to do if it's a	1.0
Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about in terms of undesired consequences. The thing that we have to realize about a show is that you have the showrunner you have the writers, but then you also have the director and you have the editors specifically the editors. Those are going to be the ones are like, oh this shot and then he's going to look at him. They don't like him, you know, and they do kind of work in tandem, but each one. Those people have their own motive and I think what we caught in was this person's like who's Derek? I'm gonna you know, they're not going to do on the show. I'm going to slip this in for the fans ha ha ha and then you have the people like, oh well slip in a little steric and kind of string along the fans and then you have someone's like no staring and so it's just this mishmash of all these different motives and it makes it entirely confusing because you also have to remember that by season for we're dealing with Shelly. They either made a huge mistake or someone was really exposing but there was a storyboard release of their ideas. It was like an outline for season 3 be specifically for 320 and on that board. It said Styles mom, but it did and it was like in small letter. So something that you could tell that they weren't really expecting people to pick up but specifically there was no mention of Malia no mention of Shelley nothing. And so it's like you give Holland talks about used to talk about getting the scripts the same day and I'm like you have a period of time that is specifically for writing. Yeah, what is happening that you're giving scripts the same day of shooting what's going on in here? What's this mishmash?	0.0
So to hone my skills much more and you opened the first location in October 2015, right? Yeah, that that's that. That's where we got the keys and officially we open up our doors November 1st 1st, 2015 16. Okay, so we'll celebrate for years.	1.0
The truth to delay going inwards as long as possible really like to try and take in with my surroundings and that's the beauty of travel by me, you know, like focus on again the nice scenery or like a big beautiful Trend that we've seen or all the other Runners, you know?

You know what I'm saying most times when you when you read a script. Do you know if the movie is going to be good at you?	1.0
Yeah. It's like all right wides are due tomorrow. Let's let's do some Cory. I'm like, let's do it, you know make it happen best in our living room. Is because our mind just like really even for competitive career if we needed to do some kind of showcase every choreography that we've ever done together was done in our living room and that was always our best one whenever we went to the studio. It just didn't work. I think we were just like so stressed about time when you're home. There's no time restriction at night you just go and you can't look kind of like look at some YouTube videos get inspired and just sit have coffee and things just go.	1.0
I don't think so. I mean you've talked about how much you've grown in four years. And I mean you obviously know the area well, so I think it's you know with as you say the industry is growing and changing and more agents are believing in staging the benefits. So yeah great great vision, I guess to set yourself.	1.0
We'd have him for half a season and then I'd want to see someone but he could do both as medical plan the wing and he weren't too bad for you like the middle. If you do any when didn't either we just won we just won better cover the cut and cover that will challenge the first thing because all right ice like Cody off right sometimes but he's got nobody really who can challenge him for that position then Duncan maybe could Bennett has played there when Cody hasn't but I mean, he's not gonna pressure code. So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right. But yeah, even Eve said that the cleared yet. He said it got to the point where no Challenge and you just couldn't get motivated. He said he was playing Robert. She didn't care. She knew was always going to be honest.	1.0

Lee written by adults for kids and they're not they just don't seem like things kids would say, I don't know. Yeah because like you look at a show like Andy Mac or something like it's very we're going to always be comparing. Yeah, but just like the you can tell like they actually like talk to children and like you understand kids at that time. So yeah, I agree with you.	0.0
They would agree that clearly. I mean we have too much of going lately too much of government intervention everywhere. The results are very bad. If you look at it from the point of view of the actual performance of the system to which they to be by academic. Education that economic growth income and wealth distribution as as far as the economy is concerned all these they always screw up right? So you need less of this the problem if you want to turn it back is that it's really it's It's much more difficult than adding a little bit of it to the existing system existing system. So if you have the current system and you have it more government involvement in education, so on a little more that's not a big shake-up for the whole system. It just makes it paralyzed that it a little bit more if you increase taxes a little bit more that's not a big shake-up. So it just makes it marginally more difficult unless you try to turn. Back, we got a problem, especially in the economy. We got a big problem because the economy is so fragile because it is sort of become a Dead junkie but under the influence of monetary interventions in particular. So if you scale back a little bit of this Q fragile eyes and migrate the bankruptcy of certain elements of the economy at this might entail snowboarding effects that have the potential of going on. On all the rest of the economy with that so it's not easy to go. The other direction of I tend to think that as the rule you should think big as you guys are doing apparently because you're raising a big question and you should not be afraid of considering a complete overhaul just cutting a bit from under-20 something like this. I mean certainly the case of money and government spending in the economy. It's on this concert. I think that's definitely a really realistic option.	0.0

Yeah, this is almost as perfect as it gets and I can almost guarantee. There's going to be craziness on draft night and only Brian gudykunst in his team know who they're looking at and what they're looking for particularly and all we can do is sit here and speculate based off the team needs, but it's fairly how it goes, isn't it? So I can't wait for the draft personally, but if they at they ended up with this kind of Hall addressing so many positions with the value that we got and want Thornhill Debo Samuel Noah fans. I'd be over the moon and I great also folks.	1.0
Yeah, it does goes from Cape Jervis across the bottom of the floor area up sort of near Victor Harbor, which is nearer we start at y pinga and and then it goes up through the Adelaide Hills generally. Then across right past Mount lofty and right up into like sort of not far from the Clare Valley and and then you end up it finishes in the Flint North and the Flinders ranges like up in the desert. And so obviously we just covered the bit down on the this south of Adelaide and so basically going from wiping out to kaipo Forest for those who are not from here that doesn't really make any sense, but locals know all about About it. And first thing I will say if you're not from here, this is like becoming a really good 100K race. Like I've seen it grow over the time that I've been doing it and Ben Hawkins is the race director and who sort of the founder of ultrarunners essay and he's also a very good friend of mine. He has just he put his heart and soul into these races and he he goes he was so he was a crook as a dog on the day he could barely speak. Because he had and his wife is 38 weeks pregnant and he was there at you know, and he just from from Son Well Before Sunrise and too well to the very last Runner came in, you know, like he just you know, they'd lose race directors work hard and then also that the rest of the team like been pieman, pardon me and and Michelle Hanlon and probably a bunch of names. I'm going to forget plus all the a station volunteers. They all everyone just works really hard. At this race and this year was the best year. So anyway, I took off really fast. I'm running along I get to the first style to step over the thing so and hang on. Hang on.	1.0

And that's where you will find the meaning. That's where you find. The the starting point for Meaningful life is just astonishing it's great.	1.0

I mean, I'm a running coach and also a mouth as if I listened to the podcast nose and we get so fixated on top running for a certain time. I finished time and I and I had a client say Only once during the speed session and she'll quite often doesn't want to train with a watch on at all and not even know you're like your $10 digital watches you guys. She said she wishes it there was a watch it didn't measure your time, but measured your your enjoyment like so, you know, especially, you know, if only we had a way of measuring like other metrics for our run and so it'll be good. You know, you get to a point and your little watch says that you're enjoying yourself, you know, like do Native watch for that but because I didn't I get so I do I keep saying on on getting time goals the truck certain training sessions and and making sure I was getting heart rate goals and you know, all that stuff. And yes. Yeah, so I think you would probably you seem like the kind of person who would like to buy a watch. It measures your enjoyment and not your time.	1.0

Well those profound thank you. That really was that changed like that. I've been thinking about that later time again. I'm not always an upstanding citizen the other day saw kid wearing a trump shirt went up to him and said hey asshole dumb fucking shirt, and then I walked away. So like I am not always tolerant like that's that's not to say I'm always a fucking piece love ya person. Like I have my mole of unity respect. Yeah, you know Fleur Fleur life, baby. They'd always the case. But I try as hard as I can and that's all you can do. That's all you can do and again like that comes back to like kind of what I was talking about are just being kind to yourself. You know, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall back. It's okay, but if you're mean to yourself, you're going to sink down deeper into it. So what I used to do when I was in high school. Yeah. I know I'd be like, yeah, I fucking suck. Ooh, I'm going to go do this and then feel worse about myself and be like Oh, my life sucks. I'm like, yeah. Yeah for me. Yeah for me then your victim card gets maxed out and you're like I need to make some changes definitely, you know, there comes a point when you're just like damn it really be all me not all you but like well, no, it didn't a its. It says I don't know. It's just your responsibility to take care of it, but it's not your fault. No exactly. Yeah, because like you it's not your fault that your brain isn't firing neurons correctly and like you don't have enough chemicals. Of Serotonin or dopamine? You can't regulate go green like it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with it a hundred percent. Yeah, because you know, you don't want to be you don't want to be kind of putting out more sadness into the world if that makes sense. Yeah, if humans don't have a way out like if a cell doesn't have a way out it will die. Yeah, like it doesn't have any pores. Yeah, it will like become full of its own waste and die and that's like people if they don't have any Outlets they become I'm full of negativity and they can't Thrive. Yeah, you know really? Well that's where made up ourselves. Yeah, exactly. And so it's like just making those channels to connect with things that you really love isn't really important because if you get in the flow state where you're like, I'm forgetting that time is a thing. I'm forgetting about everything else like when you paint or like stuff like that like that's when You're happy. Yeah when you're going out, yeah, not even happy but just like it was kind of music and yeah concerts and dancing or after something you forget or moshing for a while pockets are the best or they make you remember when they play that one song. Yeah. It's remember that memory and just cried out. Yeah, that's so true. Yeah. A depression is a bitch it can make you think a lot of things that aren't true, but just know that. Your thoughts aren't always real and just note that even though it does not seem like it you have the ability to overcome it. Yeah, it's in you it's in all of it's not gonna happen overnight. Hmm definitely but it can get better and it does get better like speaking as someone in high school who's always thinking about dying. Yeah now I'm 22 almost I don't think about die every day definitely. It's good. Yeah, and if you obviously like this goes without saying almost like if you're feeling these negative thoughts like please tell someone like people want to hear it people would rather hear you complain then hear about you dying a hundred percent. So like there's outlets for that too. Like there's support groups. Like there's so many things you can try like so many things you can try and it's not like It's not like one thing it's not like maybe one thing is going to fix you. Like it's going to be a bunch of different things that you use in your little toolbox exactly to get better. So find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia your straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms enough.	1.0
Yeah, and that will definitely during the time when the with 106 & Park Until rail was going on. So, I mean, that's why a lot of people knew about her including myself, but it was just so many artists that came out then so it definitely was easy like you Like you said to just just get missed throughout their Bunch, but the real recognize her that's what I'll say the real the real recognize we never forgot about you Emory. So I thought right so shot to you. Why don't we fall in love came out in 2002 and what you got for this week's vlog?	1.0
Yeah. I think the stakes are much higher and the industrial environment. It's on the business disruption side. So lost Revenue, Related to construction activity. That's a huge driver as well as just the magnitude of their construction spin. So they're looking at it from both sides right there looking at it from how long is it going to take to construct this new plant or retrofitting existing plant? And what's the overall cost of construction services that I'm going to you know that I'm gonna spend on construction services over the next 10 years and and they are capital planning on that type of arising Capital planning in commercial. Environments tends to be a shorter Horizon. And so that also then also challenges how we think about Innovation and work programs in things that we can do to make the construction delivery process more effective like off-site construction. And I also think the dollar spent is smaller as well. Like you said you might have one off buyers or Construction Services or even if they're not one off they may build a project every five years. So you're essentially are a one-off type Builder or they're planning Horizon is Noah's law. So if Multi family developer or Builder cash right now. You're probably saying I hope I hope the music keeps playing for another 24 36 months and I'm running out this wave of multifamily boom, and I'm not really quite sure where this Market will be five years from now, whereas oil and gas and petrochemical owners there. They've got a 10 15 20 year view on the capital spent where that's going.	0.0
Yeah, so and that is that is also really based on where you are in the country that we see in certain markets where you've had over expansion particularly multifamily. We do see it maybe not cooling off as the Word, but returning to normal, so Manhattan is a great example of this the multi-family residential boom in Manhattan. They were the let them in the market has doubled over the last five points there. And so it's going to pull back it's going to come back off of highs from probably probably do the extent to 25 30 30 percent decline of construction put in place, but it's still going to be a big building Market. It's just going to pull back quite a bit and it won't be as crazy competition will be fiercer DC star. Going to pull back a little bit in terms of Spin and so in certain Pockets where you can wrap intention Nashville's a great example, we've had rapid expansion over the last several years. We see a leveling off and maybe even a slight pullback, but you're also seeing a rotation and Healthcare sector fewer and fewer large sort of bed Tower Hospital projects coming out of the ground seeing a shift towards more. If you look at spaces like Hospitality hotels are going up all over the place, but the economy is good. Some people can afford to travel and so who broke warmest support the fact that what we've got more Travelers we ought to have more Hotel Beds.	0.0
Um, well, yeah, so we haven't bought any any Bulls right right this minute that are that are really fancy. I mean, I got some calves that I bought from a guy that from ask from a neighbor that are look really good with the dummy and and have got a couple Rider trips on that look like they might Might be really good but I don't want to brag on them yet because they just pretty green. But what are those who you lines? Sorry. What are they two year olds? And you said they had a couple of ridership for the three year olds their fields? And and then then I have I do have a horse coming on a young horse that I call white-hot. He is a solid white horse and he's actually out of that gray mare we were talking about earlier. While Blue well, I got has only had a couple of Rider trips on him, but he won second at Bob Marriott's dirty rotten buckers bucking horse fraternity last summer he one second. I think it was in the bareback ride. Anyway, he looks pretty good. I think that horse he'll be he'll he'll be 5 this year so he got a little more age on him and then some of them because he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he bucks pretty Dang good and and I saw I think that that'll be a up-and-coming star for us this summer moving forward in and there's a there's a couple of other Colts that are that are coming on. I mentioned that Indian burn in that Indian summer line of horses. There's a little brother to Indian burn coming out and he's a a sista numbers 505. He's just a, you know going to be a four year old black yelling and he box Really good. He didn't even have a name yet. I need to come up with a name for it.	1.0

No, dude it was Cool, because you know why I was back the next day on contract worth making more making more. So this this is where it gets fun because okay third and I'm done with the layoff stories. I don't I have not gone back to a corporate job since then, there's positive things to find about these layoffs for sure.	0.0
So and maybe you can wrap like a band. Down around your face so that you don't worry about something splashing up. Maybe you can wear gloves, you know, I don't really need necessarily need to do those things when I'm cleaning my own toilet, but it's just an idea but the more often you clean it, it won't be as gross of a job. Especially if people are just kind of using that toilet brush as needed and then I keep it soaking in a solution in a cleaning solution, you know in that holder so, you know, just whatever cleaning It usually kind of pour some in that holder and that makes your bathroom smell nice and keeps your toilet brush disinfected.	1.0

Yeah, you get pumped by stop and you just say, oh that was just a log or something. It's Rick yourself inside. I've had my knee. A guy in the water first for the first 30 minutes he a swimming up and back up and back and it's equipment trying to detect him and I decided to do him a good turn and I said just jump out mate. Let me take over take a break and I jump in the water in a black wetsuit a pair of black fins, and I'm on the surface on my back. Just moving from point A to point B, and I look over my left shoulder to make sure that I'm still headed towards the bow of the warship that I'm supposed to be attacking and before I can turn back I You have a huge whack in my leg and it didn't really hurt but it just kind of shocked me and I turned around to look and there's just a massive shock head touching me and takes me feels like seconds to work out what's going on because I've never even seen a shock and all of a sudden is this, you know, it's like Shark Week has come to life in front of me while I'm swimming and I don't really know what to do. And I think the shark knows what to do either because it's kind of staring at me and we try to work. You out if I'm food, and then so my survival instincts kick in and I think all right. I've seen the crocodile hunter. I've seen Shark Week over our job it in the eyeball. So I tried but I can't move my arm and I looked down and I can see the teeth embedded into my wrist and every time I try and pull it I can see the flesh tearing I was so I think nothing left hand I go to the eyeball with my left and I reach over but I can't reach it and in short side grab it by the nose and try to push it off, but that Is the type of the lower jaw deeper into the back of my leg. So I cut back to try and punch it in the nose and by that stage the Sharks decided on food and starts to shake me and that's when the paint kicks in like a hundred teeth razor-sharp teeth on either side of your limb moving in unison to tear through your flash and all of the fight went out of them took me under water and I was just yelling and I was in agony and we popped up and I took it. Breath and then it took me back under and just kept thrashing me around like a rag doll and I realized how powerful it was nothing I could do and so I realized that I was going to die and I remember thinking to myself. I'm not going home today. I'm going to die right now and it was strange because it wasn't like times flow down. I think our bodies and our minds are such incredible machines and my mind went into hyperdrive and I started running. My life is hanging. Okay, am I ready to die and I thought well shit no coming from where I started out as a really lost and bad kids self-harming and drugs and all that stuff and fighting and stealing to where I had achieved Peace Keeping with the UN and the elite of the Navy and all that sort of stuff and I thought you know what I'll come further than I've ever thought possible if I'm going to die now I have no regrets. I'm ready to go. And so I let go and I was ready to drift away and the A shark at that point ripped through the rest of my leg and took my hand off and because it wasn't attached to me anymore. My wet suit made me boy and I'll pop to the surface and I realized that I wasn't dead and I thought shit. I got to get out of here before it comes back and I saw my safety boat with my three teammates in and I start to swim to the safety boat. But as soon as I take a stroke, I can see my hands gone. It just my arm ends at the end of my wetsuit and my medical training kicks in and I think I've got to keep that wound above my heart to stem the bleeding. So I've got one out of the water swim back to the boat with one hand and one leg because I can't even feel my right leg. I don't know what's wrong with it at this point. I just can't feel it. And the guys in the safety boat said I was literally swimming through a pool of my own blood and they said when they came in closer, he was actually so stick they could taste it in the air and I just I didn't think I was going to make it. I thought there's so much blood in the water sharks will come back and other sharks going to smell it and I'm going to die. I'm just waiting for a shock to grab me. By the other leg and it just never came so I just kept swimming back to the boat and eventually the guys got to me pulled me out of the water and just out of the sheer relief of not being eaten any more. I relax my eyes rolled back in my head and I pass out and my mate almost brings into action and his training tells him. I'm going into cardiac arrest and he needs to stimulate my heart. So he straddles me and he starts pummeling me in the chest. I'm trying to wake me back up and and it work. And I wake up and I look over and my hands gone freshly bitten off by a shark and I look up and tell me who's beating the shit out of me and I just think today sucks.	0.0

Thanks very much indeed. Line up by now that was fascinating absolutely loved it. So interesting really really interesting just before we came on air you were mentioning the House of Commons. Yeah, the I think we must be watching this. I forget the Channel's name because it was either the BBC News Channel or BBC Parliament and possibly both because we ended up switching off at about 10 o'clock in the evening and we started watching roughly lunchtime and I I tuned in to catch boris's statement returning from New York after the Supreme Court ruling and actually it was almost one of those entertaining afternoons of my things in my life. So for anyone asked to see me, you must watch if it's not the full show that at least the highlights of Jeffrey cocks the Attorney General because it was absolutely a PST A Pas du tout pas de resistance. Unbelievably full-blown that the whole works in the guys going to this is amazing roaring baritone anyway, but he just he just blew blew the opposition away. I think there were there were heavy expectations coming into yesterday because we're recording this on Thursday the 26th 26th of September. So it's a few days just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the Pierogi of Parliament and there's an expectation coming. Into the commons that know that they were going to Duff up the attorney general and follow up by duffing up Boris and my god did those expectations get reversed very very quickly. So first the Jeffrey Cox in this is fantastic and hilarious and then you have you know, the man himself. So Boris came in and basically just gave no quarter and there's a very appreciate what Dido just said about social media. He's absolutely right, but if you do have the To engage with say Twitter. There is a very special pleasure that can come with engaging with Twitter while simultaneously watching a big event and the Parliamentary session was a big event. So it's almost that's that's what it's designed. Almost all yeah always had become as a mixture of Theater Grand guignol black comedy. I don't know how to describe it. I'll be I'll be looking at grand grand. What does that thing? I couldn't tell you I decided to extend impressive but the Macabre so I've always interpreted, but I don't You know the full definition Barack possibly. I'm just starting at mindless French words now either. What's I don't know what's happening and being taken over by Spirit of Madness. But Boris launches at there was no Contrition. No apology was General Gregory an to the power of infinity and during during the proceedings. Basically, he's worked out perfectly how to be the world's most successful troll on the back of perhaps the success of gone. From so he started using the phrase surrender Bill about the Hilary Benn act which is basically means to be can't can't leave without a deal and every time he used the term surrender Bill the opposition benches would just get would just get more and more Angry. So course you would then continue to use the phrase surrender bills that why you change your Twitter hand. So I've changed my Twitter handle to surrender a bill cousin of surrender bill, but last night I was just having the funniest. Time of it and then I thought okay. Let's really go for it. And I said could everybody please stop using the word surrender Bill hashtag surrender Bill and then I think followed up with the first rule of surrender bill is due not mentions do not talk about surrender Bill. The second rule of surrender will is do not talk about surrender Bill and those have been my most popular tweets ever. So everyone has been filed in and it was extraordinarily funny how that must is so much fun. But on honest on a slightly more sobering note D. The one thing that Also kind of a last night was I think was Barry Sherman and some woman who is named. I don't even want to remember from the Labour party the amount of hostility rage blind rage real hateful rage that came back up Boris is it was a sight to believe and for what? It's worth. I'm and I'm clearly on one side of debate among arm the pro breaks it side but it struck me that I think labor and the lib Dems have called the public mood a hundred percent wrong on this so when they're saying own, Where the language is in temperate and in moderate and all the rest of it? I think they're no because what Boris was doing yesterday was he was giving a like a sort of a Channel of venting for those of us those Seventeen point four million people who basically felt completely cheesed off the last three and a bit years and he's actually no lightning rod for the for the opposition but an opportunity for those those sitting there not a trivial number of people who frankly have felt cheated and betrayed and he's now he's now just Taken the taken the fight to Parliament in those small way. I know anything can happen. But what do you what do you think the next steps are II couldn't even begin to say because I mean, I'm no expert in Parliament procedure and there's been but apparently neither. Does anybody else this writing the laws now as they go on I saw a headline saying that Boris had lied to the queen or something is that these terms are very nuanced. So I'm again stress. I'm no expert but my take on it is that at Boris had perfectly Sound Advice perfectly credible advice from his legal people including the Attorney General to do what he did your ocean to the mechanics as that basically said dismissing Parliament to then reinstating it the later date and that was all deemed to be sufficiently legal for him to go ahead and meet the queen and then the Supreme Court Bear in mind that also a number of very high-profile local British Justice. People also approved it and then the Supreme Court 11 to nothing decided that it was it was technically unlawful. But I think is Boris himself said what's really happened is that the legal system has been brought in it to a pine on these it has no matter talking about it has nothing to do with politics. This is the last thing you really want to happen in terms of the UK the British constitution. It is not for the courts to decide what parliamentary procedure ought to be. Like it's none of their business and you know, because we've got hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent to draw upon and people are now that that is exactly what gido is talking about in relation to the elites. Now when the elites had cornered they will do absolutely anything to you know to ensure that they win. Well, I think in this case this is this is a classic example of a Battle Royal where neither side is backing down, but the difference is know that there was a simple majority the leave And that simple majority a total of 17 and a half million people have been ignored for us three years. So no surprise that they're angry that I'm angry. And so there's a phrase that John Lanchester used it in one of his pieces a while back guy who writes for London of your books that somebody going to quote ridiculous Basil's 40-ish lengths unquote to achieve something and that's what the remain cap of done. So they're driving a coach and horses through historical precedent through law. You're through normal parliamentary life through everything just to overturn a perfectly legitimate vote. It's quite sickening. Really. Are you have some I know some people who are remain has and I get I detect that they are starting to get weary with it as well. You know Whitney nothing. Yeah, if we're not careful something get killed. Well, I say that in all sincerity. I don't mean it to have her that wanted to happen. But if trust me when you see the footage of certain labor and peas just that does blind with Fury just lashing out at Boris is deeply unsettling. Well, we can still get there. Can we is that particular YouTube and I've had some this morning on some more happy topics. I just want to say a couple of shout. Shouts first of all to Dixie Deville on YouTube.

You want to add anything to that Renee or I mean personally, I was like really nervous.	0.0
It doesn't perfect her Ballroom technique, but it is definitely really good at like jazz your type things and like the Pumped kind of dance move. She's really natural at it. Like there's some things. I remember Posh. I came home from one of the first like rehearsals he has with her and they did a Cha-Cha and they had like this like funky move in there. He's like, it's just I didn't teach like I don't have to teach her that she just did it naturally and she just made it look great. So he's like I have to use that because her like comedic skills and like the way she moves her body when she does do her comedy is very simple like similar to the Cha-Cha or Jazzy or quick subtype 5, so it's very easy for him to teach her that kind of stuff. But when it comes to the technique, obviously, it's very difficult, right? She does a great job learning it. So there's definitely a great sense of her body awareness. She knows what she's doing. Not so it's very helpful.	1.0
There we go. Fingers crossed. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, I think so. I mean it's certainly the best intro recorded so far.	1.0
Yeah, I'll go first. So I think anyone who probably knows me since I was a kid knows that Audrey was that anxiety girl the worrier and I grew up in the church and so a big Big part of my upbringing was you know, pray about it and you know, don't worry don't be anxious and have faith and all of that stuff is fantastic and amazing and it is helpful. But sometimes if you have a sinus infection or you have the flu you go get medicine to help you with that or you go see a doctor and so my anxiety kind of got to a point where it was really hard to even function where it was just like okay something is not right here. And so I would say probably probably in college is kind of when I finally was like, all right, this is not this is not normal like normal people don't get this worried to the point of you know, you can't even do new things or you can't function in life. And so I started first seeing a counselor and she was really really helpful. I think one thing about a counselor is they're awesome. But sometimes we kind of view them as like a Next it's like okay, I'm gonna fix it. But just like a car you don't get your oil changed once and then drive the car for 10 more years sure. So I think with anxiety different things in your life can kind of happen and it rears its ugly head. And so I think it's important to kind of know yourself and know what your triggers are and and acknowledge them and then not wait until things get really really bad before you try to get. Because it's just going to be that much harder to dig kind of dig out of it. Yeah, for sure. Yep.	0.0
What are you doing behind me? Like I was so shocked. I was mind-blowing.	0.0
Be alright, it's being it's been an example to indict and just letting your students watch you WEA know wholeheartedly these kids mimic every single thing we do. So imagine if if you smiled and said hello to every person across your path, you know, we talked to think in one of the previous episodes about getting kids to to learn the names of other staff members, right? And I mean, that's something that could be considered a kind act when you can call someone by name rather than just just waving or giving a head nod, you know, so that's a simple step. Inclusion is another big one and I don't mean on the the classroom inclusion of you know, different grade levels and abilities and it just including people in your everyday conversations. I just think that's an important lesson we can teach to all kids that we include people who might not feel included you'll see that in bullying statistics all the time. What if you know, what if what if what if one person had someone sit with him at lunch or that one person that someone sits on the playground so kindness as a whole can be stretched in Seoul The different directions and so many philosophies and so many ideas or things but it doesn't have to be the purchase of an item or an idea that your intently doing. It just just just be a good human being, you know, the way that the way that you would want to be treated, right?	1.0
And I guess in terms of that, you know back in the early days when the business started. Was there anything in particular like a moment or was it more of a series of events that actually led to the decision to start the business?	1.0
Like we will dissect that later like but like I feel like our evolution of news has been like So like amazing, we started off very very docile. Very like, I'm clay my shoulders showing. Well, I'm in a bralette like and now it's like full-blown lingerie. Like the lighting is on point hair and makeup is on fleek at all times Yeah. We actually she could sheet room clean when we lived together us and our other roommate decided that we wanted to take some Some group nudes. They were beautiful. They were works of art and now they hang in our home for my 30th birthday my 30th. It was my 30th birthday. I went to Paris and Mike had the best time and we had taken these nudes like right before I had gone. So I came home and Jaclyn like in our other roommate Meg who is a delight set up this whole birthday thing for me. And Jacqueline got me a full-blown canvas of one of our nudes that still hangs in my home to this day. The biggest size will take it. Yeah, it's gorgeous. It's like a shot from above. It's like we're in these beautiful like red and black colored coordinating panties and undies and it's probably my favorite picture. It makes me feel like a whole Queen. I love them. So yeah - yeah, so I post pictures on Earth. Well posed pictures that We'll definitely be there maybe one of the other ones from the shoot to like the one that's literally hanging on Jacqueline's fridge for all to see her all to see. Well, I think that's the thing is like you have to be confident in your own body and I don't take these for anybody else like I guess that first time I did but like I feel like it's 2019 like I'm out here taking these for me. Hmm and you yeah, so it's like I'm not knocking it. Send it to you because I need you to be like that's a good one. That's a bad one. Your ass looks amazing. Right we don't live together now. So like we have to send them to each other exactly like I can't just come in your room and be like is this a cute outfit to wear in a nude? I know it's tough. Also, I feel like when we say nudes it's like a range of things. It's like full blown like I'm in a robe cute towel to like up my vagina shot. Hi. How many vaginas shot? Yes, that's me. Neither. That's what you think. I will say though. I do keep my vagina shots in a wok. Folder Hank that's aggressive. That is your like assaulting people with that.	1.0

So I gotta say this news about James really took me aback. It felt like there had to be more to the story. So I've been calling emailing texting whatever I can do to get ahold of James and so far nothing. He hasn't even liked one of my tweets, but in all seriousness, I'm not as much bothered that he isn't responding to me. What bothers me is that he's blowing off Sterling it's fine if he changed his mind about investing these things happen, but it feels like At least pick up the phone and tell Sterling that the good news is James wasn't the only one who invested in sandbox Commerce. Okay. Well so Jillian also invested on the show what happened with that? I mean she didn't ghost on you two. Did she know? All right, so she mentioned she would introduce you to her partner Jacob did that end up happening?	0.0
So like I'm good, okay, but act like you can't handle a big dick, please hardly. Mmm. You could handle it if you really had to if I had to if I was meeting to yeah, if it's like, oh, I like this deck or no ticket. I mean you would choose no. No, I'm not there's no digging. I often choose. No Jacob. It's like you can go to bed or you can like travel to a dick on.	0.0

So 20 2015. I said yeah about four years on now, I guess give us a little bit of so that's kind of that going back right to the start. So in the roughly for odd years that you've been in business to kind of tell me a little bit about well, maybe start with where the business is at now just to give people listening a bit of context. So, you know any sort of numbers that you can share, you know, the number of houses staged or how many properties you look after employees anything anything at all that can give a bit of context.	1.0

So we put away the clean dishes and then it's time to either load the dishwasher or start a sink and when I talk about starting a sink load of dishes, I'm assuming that you fill up the sink with hot. Soapy water, but I realize that some people don't do that. I was watching a little video on Pinterest earlier because I try to to read a lot of cleaning articles and cleaning videos and things to kind of get ideas for the show and make sure that I'm covering everything and that, you know, I'm staying with the trends and it was a video of hacks where they showed like a little holder for your sponge and just some different things to make doing dishes easier. But what I noticed is that they were washing the each dish just in one step.	1.0

We know, you know that kind of thing, but it's so interesting and like confusing because like during season 4 like sterics were not like we were not here for I didn't even watch these in for I watched literally the finale and only the finale because I got information that there's going to be a big steric moment in it. And I was told like there could be a hug or a kiss which there wasn't a hug or a kiss but it was a big steric moment and it was like, why is the show actively trying to like kill steric but then have a moment like that where you have Derek dying and so many different like the he was going back to Styles over and over and over again. Like she'll why is that in the show like who put that in there if you guys hated so much which I have wooden table fan.	0.0

Yeah, and I think one thing you were saying to that or when you were talking that made me think of it is like eye for me like when I'm feeling anxious, I feel like everyone around me knows it. Oh for sure, but I'm really good at hiding it sometimes not necessarily around my kids or my husband. Because you day just kind of always get the worst of you unfortunately because they know you the best but you know, like tally your spouse or tell your kids like I've gotten into the Habit where I'll just tell the least like Haley some really struggling right now. Just give me a minute. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be short with you because I think like just saying it out loud is like this is a real thing. Like if I had a headache I would say hey, I have a headache or I sprained my ankle or whatever. It's like this is a real thing like this is Real condition that I have and you know, it's really flaring up today are probably having a rough day with it and just having somebody to that you can reach out to and sometimes like just laughing about how ridiculous anxiety is because it can get you like the other day Dex came home from school and he just I go are he just doesn't seem like himself. He just seems kind of sad and so are goes. Hey, buddy, so Dax is for okay, he goes hey, buddy.

Well what you know and then just kind of played out and I mean even if the worst possible thing for to happen, there are people who they're resilient that you know, we will carry on and so I think it's hard at like it's easy right now to talk about all this because We're not in the middle of like an anxiety storm because with wait till this afternoon is this weekend, right?	0.0

I was doing karate four to six times a week, you know one to two hours a day sometimes three, especially on the weekends and you know, I would compete and I think that competitive Wedge was instilled in me ever since I was a kid and you did pretty well. Yeah, if I mean I was very competitive with serious, you know, and I give thanks to my Sensations the John out there. He was like my second dad and you know, he was definitely one of the reasons why I'm such a great trainer today because he the way that I count the way that I talk the way that I push other people he did to me.

Basically I felt very nervous out the gate. I was incredibly nervous and it was in my opinion. It was reflected in the pitch because I honestly my opening was Completely different than then I had prepared for and I just kind of got caught off guard by how nervous I was at the very beginning and then I kind of got my bearings back and then I felt good and after a few minutes, so after you get in the room you start pitching so you're obviously a little bit nervous up front.	0.0
That was so so again my take on it from all the features that I end up liking the majority of the songs. He clearly had the best out of the Three Amigos. I'm gonna give him a 3. I'ma get my three just just based off of off of that along because I really thought especially after the delay the first delay. I was like man, I don't know about this. Like, what is he really trying to do was he trying to save face what else is really going on with it? But I think all in all once it finally came out. I thought they did was a pretty a pretty decent album and I enjoyed it for the most part for what it is the production to I forgot to mention. Yeah production will definitely good for ducks with Delphine. Good night. And obviously that would me that's you know, my biggest thing. I look at the reduction first and then like at the features on there. I'm seeing how you mesh well with the features and then you know, the lyrics come out through for me. So again, I enjoy it down man. I definitely do it. So I'm gonna give it a three. So that's our takes on it. Also Father for I I give it a 3 flight gives a two and a half. So there you go man as I'm review. Let's get to the song of the week. Now. I have to make two chains again because I don't know if you got a chance to listen to a rapper go to the league yet, but there was a particular song and let me not mess this up here give you the proper name of the song, but it had Ariana Grande on it. And it's only called rude earlier. Yeah, it's called rule the world and it had a Camry Camry sample here. I was like, whoa. I said I know this sucks. I said, what is this? I said oh, oh no, I feel like I told everybody on Twitter. I said are we gonna grind a doing uh doing a remix of why don't we fall in love and what I'm going home? He's like nah, he's I always felt that I was like, yo I said give it a chance man. Give it a chance. I'll legs actually a good song where you like. Nah, you like I'm good. But it just inspired me to like go back and listen to the Emery. So I want to we fall in love and when she came out. Oh man, I forgot like how hot she was fam. Like this song was fucking dope and shit. So I would have listened. I was like yo, this song was bumping yo, they beat was was dope as hell. So this is going to be my song for the week and that was inspiration from the from the sample remix for a router word vagina Grande en change to chase album. So Amory, why don't we fall in love? This came out in 2002 people 2002 to memory did take a long break, but she did apparently come back. I haven't even get channels in that album. Do I ain't even gonna lie, but but you did come back and start making music again, but when we first came out man, she had a bus. She definitely had a bus. So I respected that and this was definitely one of my favorite songs from her. Why don't we fall in love the find Marie Van de saint-fond is that stain? Wait find is that they I death he had a crush on her face that want that one thing video, bro.	1.0
It's rude. So a my best, you know, what try a little harder Dana bows day says, I'm so low in the am getting them ready for school and I often find myself saying why are you naked? But yeah, it's hard to get she said she has a hard time getting close our kids.	0.0

There was a it was a co-op in one of the sides and they had their own Production Studio over there.

So if you have some time head over a second alarm dot-org check and mate give him some love and yeah, and then is actually one more. Oh, yeah, except my gloves.	1.0
Yeah again, I had a good thing about this one and I always just kept coming back to branding and I think this comes back to my corporate days where Brandon is so important the corporate company that I made sure that my brand was Sit up and it was consistent from the get-go. So, you know graphic design website all that stuff that kind of ties your whole brand concept together. It's probably one thing that I've been very mindful of since I registered my business name back in 2015.	1.0
It was easy to maintain and it reinforced the type of play. I wanted when someone would make a great play. There would usually be one or two girls yelling heart sticker. It was perfect fast forward to The Following season a few of the same girls are on my team and I'm excited to use stickers as bribery for good play yet again. I announce this to the team at our first meeting expecting the same excitement and enthusiasm which existed with my previous team. However, this group of girls was older and quite frankly not even mildly enthused about stickers Gotta Love high schoolers. I was a little taken aback. By their sideways glances and raised eyebrows, but just knew that once we started playing and they started earning their stickers. They would love it. This was never the case try as I might the stickers never stuck. I tried and tried but it eventually proved to be more of a distraction than a source of unity halfway through the season. I admitted defeat and ditched the stickers. If anything that experience taught me that I cannot force traditions on to a team, especially when they develop organically from a teammate. Up of completely different individuals. So when you are trying to create reinforcements of your preferred behaviors just be aware that some may not work as you planned and be okay with abandoning your efforts when you're positive. They won't catch on or work for your team. Try things out that worked for you when you played But realize that your team might not be as excited as you are just because something doesn't catch on initially doesn't mean it won't work. I enjoy mixing up teams and warm up Partners, but telling the girls to pick a new partner literally never works. And someone is always complaining it's horrible. I started asking my girls to line up alphabetically by their favorite color favorite flavor of gum favorite band Etc.	0.0

So personally, I was always very shy and I never really wanted to try new things and I was very close and Just in general I would I like to be in my bubble and ever and ever like to try anything new. So she was always trying to get me to do different shows and whatnot. And then she always said to me trust the process. This is something that since I was a little kid she was just telling me non-stop if I always doubted my like if I doubted myself or whatever it was she said trust the process everything happens for a reason if your I remember just like losing one competition. We were like next in the final or something like that and I remember coming out of that cup. Shouldn't and I was just so sad. I was like, oh my God, whatever I'm doing. It's just not happening. It's I don't know. What like what what else could I possibly do to be in that final and this that and the other and she's like trust the process. It happened for a reason and it definitely did because I remember the next competition. I was so hungry for it and I wasn't I was just trying to do I wasn't trying to compete with anybody else. I was really just competing with myself and trying to improve myself more and I remember that petition ended up in the final and doing really well. So like things like that. She always let me know that everything happened for a reason and if something didn't happen it's meant to be that way and funny enough about two years ago. We tried out for Dancing With the Stars.

That's like the next level because people want to be the content, you know, and I think just viewing the content isn't enough for our brains now just passively watching something you everyone wants to participate in it and Twitches like gaming is the ultimate medium. That's right because it's like a sub entertainment now, you know, it's like weird. It's like you it's chat is responsible for Providing a good stream in some ways. You know, it's like hey, it's a very strange phenomenon was he just did he talk about Twitch in that book or know? So I mean he taught he basically it's a really good book. I suggest everyone reads it but he basically talked about the emergence of like modern entertainment and the sense of like The Simpsons being the one to break the ground basically completely breaking the fourth wall inviting people to participate almost in the sense of like like this is ironic. I'm going to make fun of things in a very ironic way and You know it as an advice like as someone who's smart and pays attention like you can participate in that because only you understand this for reference. And then in the same same stance like Twitches in the live entertainment is the same way like you can under you are able to watch this at this present moment and can participate in it. So he's saying that basically his product prediction is that people will get more and more involved in the content that they consume until it becomes extremely homogeneous, you know. Yeah, it like breaks down the relationship of An audience number until everyone is up on the podium together. You know.	1.0
Yeah. I was like Brandon said that you guys were going tomorrow and Thursday.	1.0
Like what are you what what are you so a minute later like okay. I guess we'll go but then we're about to keep falling and then me and Dave go back to the lady and we have to explain why what we were doing because I think she thought we were going to like kidnap them.	0.0
We mentioned that the varying degrees of wealth within a society if we look at let's say a selection of different countries. How sustainable do you think the the euro currency system is given that you've got clearly delineations of wealth between the core and the periphery and that's manifest in the in youth unemployment.	0.0
That's the first time I've ever really I can still wear my watch but I felt was unnecessary. Yeah, like I was I didn't check my watch at all like that all around it as a race and then I got good times out of it and still felt like looking back. I still feel like I got more to give and yeah, just enjoy the race. Yeah. Yeah, so take whatever.	1.0
So just recently here in Adelaide. We had the six day race. So the MI6 day. Yeah, the only one in the country and I spent a fair bit of time down there since very close to Mike to where I live and phenomenal like these guys so they run at one point four kilometer Loop. Around this path, which goes past the nice little like and they do it for six days. And it was just and it got quite warm we had the first couple days was windy and cold and then I got quite hot and we had I think the winning distance in the end was a local guy named Darren Darren Lenny who did 835 kilometers in six days and handling. Yeah was my blind. Yeah. But I just and I know there was some amazing performances right across the board like Annabelle Hepworth you I think he's from Queensland. She came she was second out right? And she said Chris Ryan Chris was there she was the second lady. She bought she did oversee.	1.0

Oh, yeah. Nice. That's cheesy like FM phones up like worried to be like always worried about what what's going to happen with this Maps because I don't think valve communicate that well. With the mappers and people who get their Maps included in the game or anyone for that matter. So I think it's a probably a sigh of relief for him who I'm sure it does a lot of this stuff by himself without even talking about like for example with a simple graffiti that's on cash under Heaven on be site. He did that himself. It's not it's not actually a major a major moment graffiti by Valve. It's a graffiti. He added by himself picking up from from the major.	1.0
It's gonna be yeah if we're going to start this. We're going to cut it. So what I did is I approached my pastor and I told him this is before Indians. He leaves and migrated to States. Yeah, we want to open up a small group that we just work out once a week in our congregation. So that's where it really started. So and then you know, they first class.	1.0
Evils of the buildings and the bunker on that's built into like the side of the mountain exactly and I and I think like that's the one area that I love how you can play at different levels and regardless of the legend that you are. You're not kind of hindered because you can basically like the walls are low enough that you could mantle right up to the top floor. Yeah, so like it so it's all like if you're a Pathfinder, you've got instant High ground and no one else can come up and get you and plus you got that balloon on the Side so you can yeah, you gonna come back.	1.0

Yeah.	1.0
It was I mean, we did definitely clean up a lot and what I liked about the tour as well as we didn't get too comfortable. So every like two weeks we would try to take well actually every night we would take one dance and we would Like that one dance to make sure okay. Are we on sorry. I was in the right spot. Are we on our marks? All right. Let's try to make this better. So every single night we'd have one dance we'd focus on so that that night it would be a good like a good quality number with a right positions and makes you like make sure it's clean. So I think because of that it really helped towards the middle and end of the tour to stay clean because we did try and perfect the dances one at a time instead of like kind of Try to do everything will open the whole show doesn't necessarily work. No, so dedicating one day to one dance really really truly helped a lot. And I think that's that was the key.	1.0
This is fine. But like it doesn't do much for me. Like what does it do for you? Tell me what it does for you. I so it depends I guess on the situation like I love a good dick pic because I just need all the information like I need to know what your dick looks like. It just makes me feel like we're a friends on a whole nother level. I love that but also like when you get a dick pic, and it's like I caused this dick. To be hard it is the most amazingly like makes me feel like the baddest bitch the hottest bitch, you know, like I did that I guess what I did. I've never thought of that right?	1.0
So sometimes you need to vacuum or sweeper room just to kind of force yourself to look at it in a different way and get it vacuum ready.	1.0
I didn't know what to expect. I think you know because originally like when my mom was telling me I was hesitant, you know, I was you know, I don't need to meet him and you know, she was just like no just meet your father and I should you know, and and when I think about it now and my mother and I have never Discussed this but when I think about it now, you know, some of that was probably for her as well like yo, I had this kid together married for a couple of years like you ain't been in his life and which would make sense to me. I get it like at least see him once you know, but for me, I really didn't have any expectation, you know, and It you know, it's a it's a weird thing, you know, but for me, I took all of those emotions and I turned them into fuel a really transformed all of those. I guess you could call them negative feelings and I transformed it into fuel, you know, and and and I also use that you know, I felt like I'm the man of the house. I gotta protect you. I gotta protect my mother. I'm gonna make sure she good, you know, and I took it and ran.	1.0
And so don't worry about don't like don't think about sickness or anything will say immediately afterwards you go to the hospital and get great antibiotics all that, you know the eating part which was you rather have to suffer through. I would rather suffer through I could probably eat a rat I would do a red because a rat it's like a wonderful thing. And once you're done with it, you're done with the I feel like with cockroaches or multiple. Love them and you have to experience it like over and over again until you finish the bowl when we eating for it's a it's a bowl or just say one a bowl of cockroaches. So say oh yeah later time.	1.0
I think we ask God for so many things that sound like good ideas, but then we have the opportunity to practice those things. A lot of us are like, oh heck no like not right now next time right?

What are some things that are acceptable today by the world that is So beating it to God or that's exposing like are weak faith in God, right? Because sir, I in chapter 16 verse 3 sir. I took matters into her own hands by giving hag are to her husband Abraham, right her weak faith in God. She said God has prevented me from having children. She had trouble believing God's promise like Abraham in chapter 12, right, which says let's go back to chapter 12. God said God. I mean God told him that are I'm sorry. No in chapter 12 when he goes to Egypt and is like look you are a very beautiful woman. He says this to Sarai when the Egyptian see you they will say this is his wife. Let's kill him. And we can have her so please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life in treat me well because of their interest in you. So here's the thing Abraham's lack of faith that God would protect him. He took matters into his own hands write and tell Sarah to act as his sister and it creates all these problems while they're in Egypt same thing with Sarah when she took matters into her own hands because she had trouble believing God's promise out of this lack of Faith came a series of problems now. I want you to think of our your life or I'm thinking of my life right now how this happens when we take over for God right trying to make his promises come true through efforts that are not in line with his specific directions. Sometimes God gives us a promise. Sometimes we hear God calling us like, okay like	1.0

It seems nine people be crazy and you know back to bring them up with naloxone like, you know, if you have the means as a responder with like a bag valve mask and oxygen no freeze for them. Give them that oxygen concentration. That's just going to help them come up so much nice. Afterwards where we're getting those fights is we're rolling up on scene and people are hammering with naloxone prior to our arrival, but they're not doing in ventilating then we start ventilating then we give them a little bit more logs on and then they come up from the quickly right? It's probably because they've already got a pile of Narcan in them, but then there are hypoxic and then we're battling that so they're just confused.	0.0
So I was totally disconnected from being a household name because there was no social media, so I didn't know that you didn't know you were famous now, I know. I was famous like in New York, you know what I mean and you know certain places if I went to do promotion and it was it was a different world. So we didn't have that that instant connectivity. So I didn't know how famous if you want to you know, say like that and plus the type of person that I am.

Point right really hear anything else from any other student made me think like yeah, these guys are it was really in-depth discussion about Moby Dick right?	1.0
Or because you've been keeping up, you know, the better your daily habits are the quicker you can get to cleaning your surfaces because we spend so much time putting things where they go, you know as far as putting away dishes or washing dishes or you know, clearing clutter that type of stuff kind of eats into our time and then we don't have as much time to clean the actual surfaces.	1.0

I had a pretty comfortable potential. It is stay there for the next 20 years for the next 20 years, but I kind of already saw the glass ceiling so I could tell that you know, my limit my options were limited working for that for that company so I decided all right, so Sterling's a little rocky out of the gate, but the story he sharing is your classic entrepreneurial Journey.	1.0

So yeah, I'll tell mine then you tell your next one and then I'll tell my next one. I'm going to start off with a college story. So I had a couple girlfriends my I think it was like my sophomore year of college and we I want to say it was like st. Patrick's Day or something like that. Maybe it wasn't I could be making that up but we all like got super dressed up like curled our hair like put a bunch of makeup on like how to hot outfit we frickin wore heels like we were doing the damn thing and one of my roommates from college we will call her. I don't know. We will call her Mary that way marriage a week Mary. That wasn't her name. But we're going to call her Mary. So Mary had a friend will call this friend Bethany. So Mary had a friend named Bethany and we saw a couple of my girlfriends and Mary who was my roommate we went to this party. Like it was like this big thing. And so I we got to this party and you're having a great time. You know, we were we were all drunk as fuck living our best life's I would do anything to go back to those days, but maybe not and so Mary's friend Bethany. Are we following along Mary Mary?	0.0

One thornhill's the guy that I've really been toting on social media. He's a guy that fits all of their athletic thresholds. I think he's a very under-the-radar player this year. He's gonna be a good pick. What for whoever takes him in the second round. I don't think he goes any higher than the second. You know, I wish that a guy like Garrett Bradbury. I haven't heard his name, but I'm assuming he's gone by this point. So Garrett Bradbury would be fantastic selection at 30 or 40 for same thing with The other Center I can't members name. I'm blanking on the guy. However, Chris Lynch from he's not Center in Turkey alignment. Sorry Crystal incident from Boston College both.	1.0

Thanks Jay. Couple of years off my life, but the craziest part to me was that there were some fans some Indians fans who were saying still probably not enough. I'm like, what are you expecting? I do think we need a little bit of a reality check when it comes to what fair trade offers would be. I think like I mean, I think the Dodgers are struggling to come to terms with the idea of even including Gavin Luxe by himself. Like that's it. Yet you're having people saying like Lux plus May plus Verdugo. I would definitely need all three of them and then it probably want like another piece or and it's like that's not how this works and teams treasure young controllable cheap Talent more than ever. And guess what the Dodgers have a really really smart front office. So yes, Dave you think you're sick of the Indians winning 90 plus games every year and not doing anything about it. Dodgers fans are so sick of the Dodgers winning. Seven straight NOS titles and having nothing to show for it with a massive payroll and robust farm system, but still their teams are disciplined and the Dodgers have a really good front office and they're not just going to throw everything at the wall to get Lindor for two years and maybe they could reassign them. But, you know teams just don't do that. I think it used to be a lot easier to pull off this sort of trade because there are there were more dumb front offices. I don't think I think there's only a couple of now and those teams probably are pretty bad. So you're not going to be dealing with them in this situation.	0.0

Jajuan Johnson to the Browns David long to the Vikings sudden Smith to the Titans Antoine Wesley to the Eagles Darius Slayton to Denver white rate of the Rams. Will Grier going to the Patriots to they maybe get another backup quarterback that could be trade bait in four years. Titus Howard to the Falcons final pick of this for round mock was Michael Jackson from Miami over to Philadelphia. So if there are no trays and in the dream scenario, this would be how the Packers would Shape Up according to what Tyler and I have decided to do Brian Burns goes to 12 and no offense goes at 30 Debo Samuel at 44 one Thornhill at 75 Connor McGovern and 114 and daylan Mac at 118 if That were to be the case and if all these pics were to end up in Green Bay, I would be Beyond ecstatic. I would not sleep very well.

Did you play how much traveling are we going to do? How do you decide playing time? What uniforms are we getting? Can you give my daughter a ride when our practice is going to be? How do you think will do this year? Try to address as many of these questions as you can in your introduction to the team the fewer questions. There are the quicker everyone will get out of the meeting which busy parents appreciate additionally. If you answer some of these questions up front like how long have you been coaching? It will feel less like you're hiding things and you will see much more confident and trustworthy do your research have your ducks in a row and lay it all out on the table a sample introduction for a first-year coach could sound like this. Hello everyone. My name is Whitney Bartok. And this is my first year coaching volleyball. Although I'm new to coaching. I started playing volleyball when I was in sixth grade and have been playing ever since while in high school. I worked at every summer camp and even LED Camp my senior year. What I loved about coaching during Camp was seeing the girls develop their skills and watching their enthusiasm for the Game grow. Although it's my first year coaching. I know that this program has been very successful in the past. I plan to build on those successes with an aggressive playing style which still develops the Er Team you should then go over team rules which is detailed in subsequent sections established travel plans the possibility for any additional travel uniform ordering if not already in place practice schedules and team policies. Once your presentation is done open the floor for questions. You should have addressed most of the topics which apply to everyone so you may get individual questions at this point note that you can discuss individual questions afterwards, so the group can be dismissed. If you do not already have it have sheets, which families can complete and pass around at the meeting for contact information follow the meeting up with an email summarizing your points and reiterating any questions, which you answer during the meeting one final note. Although I often refer to family members as parents throughout these Pages Please be aware that sometimes you may be communicating with Aunts Uncles grandparents legal Guardians step parents cousins. The list goes on and on I And being inclusive in your speech because not everyone will have a mom and dad as their primary support system. I prefer to use the term family as often as possible since this has always captured everyone who is a legal guardian for my girls. So despite my use of the term parents on occasion. Please note the family structure for your players before you say anything which exclude someone who cares for one of your girls more paperwork. I know I know you thought you were done with paperwork, but I have good news for you.	1.0
I mean, I feel like there's probably a reason they hired you. Something about you. They're like that's kind of the quality we're looking for.	1.0
Yeah there I was looking at it the Gold Cup also America's going into first. I believe that the western hemispheres. Version of lie. It's like the world conflict though like North America and South America only and I believe I don't know but it had you not it's going to be United States vs. Mexico. So if you guys want to watch the guys play for that one, you can watch that it's like later tomorrow. But yeah, so we have those two sports going on cup is north and Central America and the Caribbean region. So yeah, there you go guys besides that that's all for sports. And I think we're going to end this podcast with a quote. I like to add. I'm going to leave a quote for this time and then we can have like Rick your debut one for next time. So today's quote that I would love to leave you all with would be so the quote that I live by and I it's really believable. So we'll give an example after I say the quote. Once you stop wanting something it usually happens. So like we were at Taco Bell and KFC today and Dave and Rick. He's been looking for jobs, right but they didn't go up and ask. Are you guys hiring instead? We got our food we were hanging out, you know acting a little dumb because you know, that's what guys do when they're with other guys. We really love doing but we weren't doing like we weren't doing really like it wasn't bad like we it was considerable to just like really separate. The out here who writes on the table on accident. Okay.	1.0
Men, yeah, thanks to the rooster crows cover. That was so with the boosters Rose.	1.0
I like to just pull my hair back and wash my face and I don't really wash my face with hand soap.	1.0
it was pretty great. Like I've never really felt that way before it was like probably one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. Yeah. It was really cool because like the volleyball team Adam wanted 15 years and it's like a big milestone just to win again and like I haven't done like a basketball like we haven't won the basketball championship or anything. So it was just really cool.	1.0
They have free meals at the school. Yeah, but they're like little Groove my kid comes home today and says all he had was I don't remember what he said. All I had was this they had mozzarella sticks. It was gross and like if they fucking surf mozzarella sticks for free at my school. I would be fucking 500 pounds. What are you talking about? Kid doesn't like mozzarella sticks. I don't really like mozzarella.	0.0
So basically the all the kids that we have that we hand out that general public get there's ampules point 4 mils per milliliter of Apple of the naloxone in the kits and there's three samples per kit with three syringes and there's also nasal atomizer naloxone that people get handed out as well majority of the law enforcement's usually have those There are four milligrams. They work pretty well. However, the majority of the ones that are handed out are all the inter muscular injectable injectable kits. So those ones that we talked about are just wanted to really expose everybody on what's in the kit how to properly use it then we talked a lot about how to actually recognize and respond to an opiate overdose. And we talked about some of the myths of of the overdose responses as well. So this is just for us. Nervous system depressants from opiates specifically and not certain certain stimulants.	0.0
Yeah. So we've sort of set you up with a really slow Progressive run return to run program over the next day, you know ten days or so and we'll just see we'll just be really responsive each day. Tell how it seems to react I think you sort of at the stage where it was a hot spot. Like it's really calm down and a little bit of running were actually be good for it. But just a little bit.	1.0
Yeah, actually the way we ran into her. Okay. So basically she was taking lessons with Shirley Ballas while we brought her in so we usually like to bring her in like book her up. Lessons so she actually was having a proem lesson with her partner with her professional partner and she was new to it. And she I think she had just won the World Championships and like in syllabus or something like that and she like she was so good and Ballroom. She just started Ballroom. Wow, and she saw some the studio one day and she's like guys we need to do a video together and we're like, all right, you know like didn't think anything about like of it and she's like, right so James Bay is coming out.

Then we cover it with re calling because they've got an option on a character as well as well have my up front. So when I face Yugi can't record it now. He's he's not good enough to Warrant calling back. I disagree. I like that's one thing. I think we should call it your player buffing with the current stay at the school. Now, I would have him yeah long-term he for me.	0.0

And I guess you're like you said, they're very complementary businesses. But at the end of the day, they're still two separate businesses and different. In the in the sense that although the obviously there's some crossover in the fact that you've got home Wares and things that you can use in staging as well one is still a retail store and one is a service. How do you find running two businesses that are very different at the same time?	1.0

Jerry Tillery is V from Notre Dame Eric McCoy from Texas AM Jonathan. Abram is number 7 from Mississippi State and though that's your top seven currently. Peggy's I think fans. It just makes too much sense if he is there a 30 to make the pic he couldn't he's the souped-up version of what your Michael Finley was and I think he'd be a stone-cold solid player for years and years and years and Green Bay Pleasant, you get the fifth year option for a tight end, which is always a good thing.	1.0
It is mind-blowing. Yes. I can't even believe I get to do this I get paid to go and do things that I would pay to do and then I get a little home movie out of it and everyone gets to watch it around the world. Yes. Absolutely, amazing eyesight. They pay for me to do incredible things that people don't get to do I swim with great white sharks without a cage where she does that although it is kind of like every year makes me wonder how Discovery Channel's going to try and kill me this year and last year. I did a survival show with a British Special Forces Guy where we parachuted from 15,000 feet directly into the Pacific Ocean for 44 hours with no food. No water surrounded by sharks was the fairgrounds or else? No, not the Bear Grylls last night. It was a guy called James glancing who was a royal Marine 44 hours at the ocean. Yeah. That was it's a long time. These aren't you can understand how hard it is when you're bouncing around the ocean. You're tired. You're hungry you're thirsty and trying to cut. Hole in the butt of your wet suit while you're moving around too. So you can poop student suit. You can't sleep in the suit get a rash. Yeah, I thought that was the second one the E before they blew up our boat off the coast of the Bahamas and we drifted through the ocean again through the Atlantic surrounded by Oceanic whitetip sharks, which are the sharks blame for the biggest shark attack in history the at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. So there was Reportedly 300 American Sailors were eat by these sharks. So it was kind of you know, I wasn't just a survival thing was a message about shark conservation and what to do if you're stranded and you lose your boat, but also telling the story of these Sailors, so it was a really great thing to be a part of was there any part of you?	1.0

So the last thing we'll do is we're going to go into some reader mail. Okay, first up we have Travis. Hey guys and girl with the release of Apex Legends with with the release of Apex. Legends came the inspiration to replay Titanfall 2 campaign upon completion of the campaign. I noticed something pretty interesting in the final mission. There is a huge reference towards Apex Legends. I was dumbfounded the Bounty Hunter that catches you in Titanfall 2 campaign mentions Apex Legends and gives you a and Apex card as a sort of invite to the game pretty cool. This could also eat or this could also even have some relevance on future characters in Apex. Maybe. Could you possibly be Pilot Jack Cooper in Apex or even the Bounty Hunter mercenary General martyr. What are ya'lls thoughts? I mean, we talked a little bit about Titanfall. So I felt like that was a perfect email to bring up. I mean, I honestly did not know that I full disclosure. I'm sorry. I'd actually didn't get all the way through the Titanfall campaign or whatever so I didn't see this but Travis I didn't finish it. It's oh, yeah, I know. II I've always wanted to and it was just one of those things like I think when I happened to pick it up I have to pick it up on a little bit of a sale or something. I didn't pick it up on day one, but I absolutely love the multiplayer and when I play a game and I really really like the multiplayer. It's kind of hard to bring myself to to play the campaign the campaign like really really good example is like a battlefield one. I really like Battlefield ones multiplayer, but the second I went into Campaign and I started to die. I try throwing down a med pack and I'm like, oh, that's right. I can't do that.

My closet as well and there are people who know that I can I'm a big believer in in sharing your feelings regardless of what because that's how people get to know you. So yes, I try to be the kindest person possible and I hope that I am especially with students. I always am but let's be honest. We all have our moments right? I definitely want to wear my heart on my sleeve. That's why I have a tattoo of a heart stone on my wrist because I do but no, I really appreciate that more than you know, and and I can't take total credit for For my I guess philosophy or attitude or just believe on this subject it stemmed from well. First of all, my upbringing I was raised by the best parents in the world and completely always surrounded by Family transition that to school. I had some of the best teachers in the world. I was lucky enough to go to a very very small school. So everybody knew everybody, you know your teachers Knew by first middle and last name then your family. I was raised in a kind World, which I think a lot of people our age were and unfortunately, Times have changed like you said times are changing and times are changing in and I'm a big believer that no one was was inherently born as an unkind human being it's something you're taught. It's something that you've experienced. It's what you were surrounded by on a daily basis and my goal. Our goal is to Decatur's should be to reverse that statistics and get it back to you know, I don't know just get the world to be one happy place. I know that sounds so cliche and and cool, but Then moving forward I guess to go back into my philosophy. And reason for this stemmed from a woman who was my mentor teacher and I know I've told this story before on multiple platforms and media devices and want to hear it again.	1.0
But you know, it wasn't like I was waking up every day and thinking oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I love myself. Like dude. You're just you're just a total stud. You're super special.	0.0

I think we're in a Content bubble. Because content bubble. Yeah, because people's Leisure Time Has stayed the same if not minimize. Like if not over time has become less and less like people's time to watch entertainment. But the more content that's being produced there less time like people like me have to consume it. So then we have to make choices like there's some good content that I won't watch. So at some point with all these Services coming in we're going to lose like the ability to even in participate or watch like great great shows so that much that's money lost. You know. Yeah that's sort of a and I choose and now for some reason I choose to consume less like easily accessible content over excellent content, you know, like instead of watching like Better Call Saul I'm going to instead opt for like a twitch stream because it's so accessible.	1.0

Way, I fully believe that what you do in dating like when you go too far you steal from Marriage from that and so you're stepping over boundaries that when you get into marriage, you're like, they'll be less of an enjoyment. So you have a and that's why you shouldn't date for too long. Like if you're 14, first of all, you shouldn't be dating. I don't think anyone under 18 needs to be dating. The purpose of dating is marriage. It's not to have a friend like the that's the purpose. It's like what is this person right for me? I think honestly, there are some 18 year olds who are like ready to be married. Read and there's different people I wasn't I mean I was 30 when I got married, but if you don't have life figured out, if you don't know what you're called to do, if you don't have a job if you're living at home, if you're not you don't have a course that you're on if you're like still playing video games for a few hours a day. You're not ready to be married. And therefore you should not be dating but choosing the right thing understanding the purpose. It's not companionship. It's not so your Instagram feed can be awesome. People can think you're popular like the purpose of dating is in that's another thing too because because of how	0.0

But remember that's one time that one time one event next week after week after week, and maybe they are maybe and I'm sure there's a couple dimples that would do it week after week after week. But but for for us, it's not something that work all the way. I'm gonna completely focus on because we have a lot of rodeos and we have a lot of good committees and a lot of people that we do business with that. We that we enjoy, you know, enjoy as well, you know, and we have to have a good set of both for our rodeos. Not just our horses, you know, we we all those committees at a service that's good throughout good quality throughout that's something that we really pride ourselves in here with our rodeo company is We're not yet. I don't want to ever be just label the horse guy or just a bull guy or a guy that has mediocre rough stock and great time today. We try and be full service. We want the best pickup man. The best bullfighter we can get the best book Bronx bareback and Bulls and and even time to be in cattle. We want to be good at it all. You know that I something that that I wouldn't when we first started this one of the one of the guys that I've Has looked up to that I've always thought had excellent stock throughout was Sammy Andrews Sam. He's always had good bulls and good horses. He wasn't just a bull guy or just a horse guy. It's so and that for me. That's not my want to pride myself in this being a Stockman not just one one one sided because at the end of the day those guys paid their entry fees to they need they deserve a decent shot, you know, so he's so leading into the to the 2019 season.	1.0
Well, I actually consider myself an agnostic atheist. So basically agnosticism is, you know a claim about knowledge. Like I don't know if there's a God or not, but I'm an atheist because I don't currently believe in one. I don't I don't think that I don't know like I don't think there's a God I don't Necessarily see a lot of proof of a God, but I'm more open to that conversation of maybe because I know like when people start talking about science and I start talking about like the origins of the universe and all this stuff. Like that's very fascinating to me and it's not something that I have studied as much as I would like to um, but I never want to be like one of those people where I'm like, yeah, there's absolutely definitely not a God and I'll fight you like to Able to prove that it's like no like I don't have this like hidden agenda. Like I don't want there to not be a God on top of that my friend circle like since their identity was in Christ my identity to them became non-Christian like that is all I was to them or that's how it felt and I would be like introduced as like, oh, this is Nicole. She's a non-Christian. Like this is my reward. Yeah, like to their new like church friends and you know more extended people it was like this is my non-Christian friend like that will know that was my label and it was so like demeaning and I'm like literally that's all I am. That's all they see is the lack of belief in their God and then I've had some people stay like you're never going to know true Joy or true happiness or true fulfillment. You're never Have purpose and your life is like destined to be meaningless because you don't believe in our God and that's just like so mean to say and it like really breaks people down and I think that goes back to this idea of like if you break people down enough, they might come back to the belief system and it's like such a manipulative way of going about things for them.	1.0

Sometimes we had like two days off in between but I remember the LA show. I think it was like our fifth show that week already. So we're so tired, but we're so excited because we knew so many people in the audience and there were going to be so many celebrities and famous choreographers and we're like everybody we cannot mess up because this is going to be the best show in that. The reaction from the audience was so cool. Like it's just a great show it gave them really.	1.0

I'm always saying I'm going to time it but I'm pretty sure it's over 2 hours and 45 minutes, but I don't know if I have it down just did the exact minutes, but it takes It sometime so if you do have an older dishwasher on a positive, you can run it back to back, you know in a shorter amount of time, but the positive as you're probably saving money if you have the newer one because it's using less water and maybe less heat.	1.0
Pete Rock true true Metro Boomin shout out the st. Louis Metro Boomin. Definitely. He was part of the the new age sound as well like the the current sound and also want to throw in Tyler the Creator. I think he's very underrated as an as a producer but he's definitely one of my favorites today as long as he's still making music. I just met my best results and I messed with this new sound. He definitely evolved a lot. So those are just so many people that I want to mention. It's definitely a lot more but To the one that I just wanted to to mention besides but the people to flock are you mentioned so it's a lot of good producers man. I just want to say that a lot of good producers back back in the day and and up until today. I know everybody's like looking for the new sound and I guess like right now you say like Pierre Pierre born. This is one of the people who has a lot of sounds that a lot of people emulate take Keith. I feel like he he does a lot of frickin Beast that sound the same to he's finally trying to expand but he would definitely do a lot of a lot of bees that sounded the exact same and I was like what the hell is is but a lot of you trying to lay his stuff. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's as far as well. I can think of right now, but but she also produces man because like I said everyone for y'all, I really think that a lot of these people would sound pretty wack in my opinion a lot of influences our name that man.	1.0

Oh you sentimentalize bitch. There's nothing more rewarding than that there really, isn't you could you could be president of the United States, but nothing nothing.

I know it's a lot but but you know what? It's so common now, it's one of those like, oh, I have anxiety who have anxiety. I have depression. You have depression who like right is it is it you have a mental illness and I really love just that there is such a spotlight on it right now. I mean, I I have always gosh my parents got Divorced when I was we moved here to st. Louis when I was in third grade my parents got divorced when I was in fourth grade and that was a pretty ugly divorce. And so because of that my parents had put me in counseling with my brother. So I was used to that concept and then I went through high school and my dad was diagnosed with ALS and that just whole concept of watching my dad died for 18 years that was a lot but in the middle of that I kind of I was always the kid who had To do all the things I mean the old the oldest so I always felt the need to always be have be perfect and get good grades and Achieve and do all the great things - Sports because I suck at Sports and basically I went to college had a awful breakup with a boyfriend and I just kind of went off the deep end. I was I would say I can't quite remember two years of my life and rightfully so and that's that. My twin just the combination of my dad and that that break up like we were going to get married. It was like a whole thing. Like we were we were there and going I switched schools and like it just all kind of like whoo One Time Hit me and at that point my parents were like, okay, it's time like we need to talk to somebody you need to go see somebody and I started seeing a therapist and a weekly basis and I was diagnosed with anxiety PTSD from my parents divorced. From fourth grade which always seems kind of strange but I guess yeah, they're the experts there and it was recording of my Apple watch was recording that and so I started seeing by somebody and we talked and I we did we I went every week and like they would give me things to work on or things so and I was medicated at that point. I think I was on two different medications and I felt good and I felt like I was starting to like get the tools that Did to like handle my situation and and then kind of calm myself down when I was, you know, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They actually were able to help me give me extra time for taking tests and things like that at school because I would just get so overwhelmed that I could like put I wouldn't even take the test. I would just sit there and like fries. Yeah, which then made my last two years of college extremely difficult, right? And but then it was one of those really crazy things that I met my husband. Well, it was my seen my super senior year of Cool, super super semester my life physical senior plus like the extra semester and I met Jeff and it was one of those things that like, I don't know if it was just our yin and yang - of our personalities. He was able to just come in and be a really great kind of source of balance and understanding for me and slowly over that first year of us dating. I wean myself off of all of the medication that I had been on now people would be like, oh that's probably not the best idea but for He understood like where I was coming from and he knew my whole background and he was like he was in favor. Whatever I needed to do. Yeah, but he definitely wanted to make sure that one he could be as part of a because he could be in our relationship and so I have not been on medication since then but up until now I have recently started well in the last year or so. I started going back to a therapist just with Hattie going back to school and trying to figure out life and what's next for me in terms. Of the crazy world and just my role as a blogger and an influencer how that's changed. I get a lot of anxiety from just being a blogger. Yeah. So being on Instagram all the time feeling like you always have to be on and feeling exhausting for an extroverted interview. Yes. So exhausted. I'm feeling like you always have to have something fresh and new and that are going to get people excited to see what you're doing that day. That's A lot and then the flip side of that is if you would if you think you post something that's so you think you work so hard you did so great and then it tanks and it's like right. Well, you know, maybe I'm a failure or what's going on and then then there's days where like or I get a comments or I get like a series of things happen. I'm also really bad about like collecting all of my feelings and then exploding. Yeah. So that's also a whole nother conversation for another day, but it's I could basically like have a comment that will trigger me and then I Disappear for like a couple of days and and I just don't want to deal with like the world. But here I am. I've selected a profession that makes me forward facing to the world, but I'm human so it's kind of hard like it's it's a lot. So yeah, so I mean I find it helpful to you go to a therapist now I do so, but I feel like sometimes I find it helpful like we just sometimes we have nothing to talk about and like and those are the days I don't you. I have the same situation you go in and having nothing to talk about and then like some ugly yucky stuff. Just yeah boils up from the bottom and you're like where did that come from? So like did not play in that but here we are.	0.0
Yeah, and the field wasn't huge. I have to say a lot of people also dnf'd and there was the option to At a certain point you could decide if you wanted to continue doing a hundred and nine or instead do the 69k option and a few people chose that option. I was determined to finish. I want to buy cowboy hat, which is what you've got if you finish the hundred and nine case, but yeah, I don't know. I just um, I just pulled it along with you just want to always do just just put a lot to take a checkpoint to checkpoint Jenga homework. I do feel nauseous for myself. The day I felt quite it all I didn't eat a whole lot that. I really kept my fluids and electrolytes. And so yeah, that was more electrolytes taking it slow heat up. Yeah, excellent. And if you give to give the to give the listener and not some idea it was 10 degrees above 10 degrees Celsius above normal. So about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and probably a little bit less maybe 70 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit above the normal temperature. Tommy year so it was really a guy that gets fixed.

I thought that it made a big difference because I remember basketball season last year that championship game was really brutal and we all really wanted it because we had beaten them before.	1.0
That's the beauty of this year's draft. However, I do think the Packers are actually pretty much enamored with one specific. Pacific player much like gudykunst says he was last year with Jai you are Alexander. I think that guy could be Noah Fant this year and I think 12 might be just a bit Rich for Noah Fant. If we're being quite honest, I would like to see him taken in the late teens early 20s, if possible. I think that that kind of meets the place where we could see a run on tight ends based off some of the other teams needs and value fits and stuff like that. No offense would be a dynamic player and a dynamic I did. Into this Packers offense and not to take away from TJ Hawkinson, but I think no offense. It's just Far and Away a better athlete even though the relative at the relative Athletic score would indicate. Otherwise, I just think that fan is going to provide more dynamic system from the tight end position than Hawkinson will I think fans are very capable blocker not as not as bad as he's given credit for he definitely has some work to do in the area, but I think he could be a very serviceable blocker moving forward and I think that given that that quality and that characteristic I think that he's going to be heads above TJ Hawkinson career-wise.	1.0

this week on Chompers its In charge week, what's in charge week? Well, it's about all the ways that people are in charge of stuff. So to start we've got a quiz about who is and isn't in charge.

Right? And I think it's interesting because first of all like a Navy a how we have to have like an individualized plan for every person based on their needs whatever it is, but that and also it makes me think of when we talk about validity and as we know validity is the idea is something NG men measuring the relevant Dimension that you intended to measure so right so like I might be like, oh my God, she is so healthy. She's so skinny. Right? Like I'm thinking that they're right her body looking a certain way that that indicates that she's healthy, but that's not really a valid measurement. Right? Like that's not valid if I'm measuring someone's like level of Health. However, you plan on measuring it it wouldn't be there skinny. Like when I think about it after I was hospitalized and so sick. I lost 25 pounds. I felt sexier than ever. But I was at my most unhealthy point of my entire life. I mean, you know, like everything was wrong with me. And so, you know to try measure like, oh she must be healthy. She lost 25 pounds. She's so on her shit, right? Like little did they know my fingers are falling off in the background or whatever is going on that. I'm sorry. I had c-diff or you know, like your body is completely out of whack at that point. So I think that's an interesting site on validity in terms of what we think measures. Health or what? We thinks measure someone having their life together or you know, and it's not actually that at all.	0.0

Well a lot of People kind of say like, oh you just threw the baby out with the bathwater like you jumped from Christian to atheism and that wasn't the case at all. I actually still believed in God for probably two years after I stop calling myself a Christian and I just had this feeling of like organized religion put God in a box and like it forced us to have these certain stories that were culturally specific and that didn't, you know, go over like to other countries. Or whatever and I just remember having this like since the freedom where it's like I could go to any country and experience like what they consider like profound spirituality and I could apply that to my life without feeling like, you know, it's not accurate and and I just remember thinking like all these religions throughout the entire world have claimed to have spiritual experiences. They've To have these miracles happen and I just I didn't like thinking like they were wrong and I'm right and like my specific story is like the one true truth and like shedding to that story itself allowed me to view like God in a much more like open way that I found super inclusive and inviting and more cohesive. And you know, I still actually hold a lot of those values. Like I want I think I'm still slightly bitter when it comes to organized religion, but I definitely want to get to the point where I can go, you know to other countries and experience, you know, their religion and their culture and everything that comes with that and just, you know, apply that to my life and you know become a better person based off of these were	0.0

Hi everyone, welcome back to the high percentage podcast. I had a terrifying 20 minutes there because I was having microphone problems and I was like, wow if we don't got a microphone, we don't got a podcast today, but got that worked out. Hey back after a Hiatus last week. We did not upload an episode and an old teacher of mine used to say there's a difference between excuses and reasons and I have reasons for this. Which was I did a DCC play-by-play last weekend. It was great and it was brutal at the same time. It was two days of nothing but watching matches and typing, you know, quick play-by-play summaries on to the computer and then quickly kind of uploading them and getting them refreshed on grappling insider.com on the plus side. We had the most traffic we've ever had in a single weekend. I mean, we really crush it and I think we did the only play-by-play really that I could find on the internet. Yet and I don't know why because it's something that definitely people look for and find Value in so that was fantastic. The downside is as far as I could tell we watched over a hundred Jiu-Jitsu matches and you know, I love Jiu-Jitsu as much as the next guy or girl but that was brutal man way. It was nine hours on Sunday and we didn't finish until the Super fight ended like it probably seven o'clock and I just didn't have it in me. I couldn't talk about Submission grappling anymore. So I took a break but I did post an article about a DCC over the week and that's why I like to talk about today because a TCC is a fantastic time to kind of check in on the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission grappling because it's generally agree that it's one of the top.	1.0
I don't know is that just has like it's like a nice blanket for all the older shows. Like I re-watched.	0.0
I don't know exactly what they were talking about.	0.0
You won't appreciate it. Anyway, so I had to bring my three year old and my nine year old and I'm trying to get my nine-year-old to go first because I know my nine-year-old is fucking all in his head about this that if my three-year-old cries and he's three so he's gonna cry it's going to make my nine-year-old even more anxious and scared. So I'm trying to get him to go for as he refuses to go first.	0.0
Yeah, so it had to make it in the top three number two Air Base. I feel like this is probably between this and number one. Obviously, these are my two favorite places. So this was probably the hardest as far as like putting it in the in the list, but air base is just so much fun.	1.0

So before I became a trainer, I was working at Cold Stone Creamery for Five years and that was you know, I had a great job there taught me a lot of character. I was cleaning every night taught me to bring the energy but how personal training came about was. I was training my mom and my dad one Saturday morning at Cal Fit and I was stretching them in the manager walked by and he approached me and said that I wasn't allowed to like instruct or tell them what to do because it would be a liability but He offered me an opportunity and he said if you take the certification through our club you could be a trainer for us and pass the certification and the rest was history.

I definitely want to let you know that just because this is, you know, a quote-unquote vegan podcast. It doesn't mean that I'm going to sit here and tell you all the benefits of being vegan and all the reasons why you should do it too and all the reasons why you should raise your kids vegan. I am not about That I'm not about telling anybody what to do. I think that my podcast is going to be here more to educate you on my life not necessarily to have you sway one way or the other that's that's your choice a hundred percent your choice and your kids are going to be raised the way that you wanted raise them.

There's a zero judgment zero judgment Zone moving on to the other kind of mom that I am I am. I am in the process of becoming a surrogate mom that is exciting news. That's kind of a little mini bomb that I wanted to drop on you guys. So I want to shine some light into that area of my life. We are in the beginning stages. I wouldn't say the early stages. That was a long time ago. That was like back in November. That's early stages. So I've been in this process for quite some time quite a few months. So it is I'm not I am now ready. It is time for me to reveal this news to you and part of the reason why I wanted to do that and why I wanted to include my surrogacy process in this podcast is because of the feedback that I've gotten by family members and non family members. So I I wanted to shine some light into that part of my life to help people make the correct decisions and to help people understand what it's like to be on my side. I know that people see a lot of advertisement about making x amount of money to help and what not and I basically want to give you my side of the story and why I'm doing it. So one of the next episodes will be about That specifically just surrogacy so stay tuned stay tuned for more on that process and the fourth type of mother that I am I like to say that I'm a mother F. ER so side note. I don't cuss that much when I do it's very rare, but I won't say I don't do it. I do do it sometimes but if I can avoid it I will So I am a mom of multiples. I'm a bonus Mom.

I ain't calling you no more and the number chanting I and I didn't call her no more and that's how we grow apart. But you know, what's the funny part? One of the funny parts of this story is her homegirl that I just mentioned two weeks before that they would I think they was in Atlanta and she said they would just you know, the girls night Sex in the City whatever and they just got into a random conversation with a homegirl a sir. Who's the one you know, who's the guy that you know you would you feel like got away or that you would marry the drop of a dime and she said me. Is it was okay that it out? So then two weeks later.

I was like yo, this is like our life, you know what I mean? Like I could relate so much to the film that I felt like I would go see this, you know, but then you know, this is me saying it in hindsight, but you just there's so many variables that come into you know, the filmmaking process the timing the market Yada, yada yada, but personally I always felt it was going to be fired. You know what I mean? Because I was a part of the process again. I'm on set with pot we doing this scene. We doing that scene and storylines going here going there. I thought it was dope.	1.0

Chuckles yeah, the political leadership of those countries. They I mean in Asia 1997 your Thailand Indonesia. So on the leadership of those countries are no places elsewhere to go. They were stuck with their God their own country. Yeah. Okay, so they were dependent on getting the country back on the rails, but now the political Elites in Portugal and Spain Greece anywhere. Have you brought this lava and Slovakia Romania and so on I mean there Korea's a lot within their own countries and within the operators of the European Union, so they want to go to vassals. They want to have jobs that are created by the European Union lavishly funded so paid under with the same Revenue relation has similar jobs in Germany and so on but then in their own countries, so that's what they want. Their loyalty are not their own country. They are increasingly to this international organization.	0.0

Yeah, that's right. And I also love music. So on the most of my training runs on could you every single training that I'm listening to something music or a podcast and during events? I tried not to like put it off until I do start feeling like I need something else to get me out of my life my brain and music really helps me and I'll sing along and I'll do my shredding a guitar and that really helps me. Yeah to me now. Hard parts of a run but I also think you just have to I think it's worse if you try and push the negativity away like just kind of embrace and then it will pass. Yeah, allow yourself to feel allow yourself to cry like I cried on the weekend. I was yeah, I had my low point but then once you get that out of your system pick up again, yeah, yeah.	1.0
I also think that their outfits look better than the runways. I know we'll talk about Runway. Yeah, but also I think they're the strongest MCS out of the bunch. So they did really well. I thought they were underrated. I was confused when Michelle said something along the lines of what did she say? Like, was it outer space or was it a lie the same I'm like, what are you talking about, Michelle?	1.0
Yeah, so that really ties to a lot of the research that we've been doing over the last three years on what we call mega-projects mega-projects find US capital intensive projects that require multiple teams pull off and they usually in excess of a billion dollars that we've seen have created lots of stress on the industry and on stakeholders within the industry owners designers. And and contractors and what we mean by you know, those the challenge for those projects being business-driven is going to take a large NFL stadium. For example, we have some sort of deadline that we've established for the stadium open probably based on kickoff of game one a couple Seasons from now and so we've got to figure out how to pull together the capital and power the contractor to the designed to get that accomplished within a another find window not necessarily. Taking the other crochet if we were going to build a structure like this, logically and efficiently, how long would it take? You know, we may be three season from now that that Stadium would logically be open and could be built in a way that the the labor market could provide sufficient labor. The contractors could do sufficient planning. The designer would have enough time to thoroughly designed the building to the extent that it's ready to be constructed by a contractor. It's the business pressures and that's just one example, you can apply that to really any project where there's a economic outcome a reason why they're every every project as an impetus for being constructed and if it's a private project because the return on investment the people are looking for if it's a public project is that there's a public use right and and those deadlines are driven by really the reasoning behind them project and that's very well understandable, but I think some of those deadlines of expectations but the public eye and from a business TenPoint have outstripped the capacity the construction industry to deliver on those expectations. And that's where we really see challenges. So back to the stadium example, we want to build a stadium in two years great. We don't have the local label Market to support it. We don't have time to pull the design together and we would stress the contractor Community to build it but we're going to try to do it anyways and roll the dice and see what happens and sometimes when you see favor welcomes, but more and more on these large projects. We are seeing unfavorable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.	0.0

Yeah. Nothing lasts indefinitely. Yeah. It's certainly not something for the next three of five years and I don't think it's something that we could and should expect within the next 10 years or something. But I could be wrong. I mean one thing that creates me because the whole doll system creates problems of its own and the problems themselves might get out of that. It's not sufficient that the current crop of politicians and central banks and so on that they are knowledgeable and that they are relatively discipline. So they don't exaggerate the practice of helping themselves with the printing press because there are other problems that are resulting from the current monetary system that we have. The most important ones being that is the lack of responsibility of the dear responsible ization and of the of the financial markets on the one hand and the the consumption of capital on the other hand. Okay. Let me be the first one is probably this needed that I explain this to you and to your audience because you're probably aware of this right that simply if you know that you have some something like a backstop that comes Through the printing press Yahoo! Central Bank behind you or the Central Bank the sues the mission of stabilizing the financial Market well, and it does so with the printing press then this amounts to a socialization of a part of your risk. So as a consequence risk taking as rule is always on. All right, so you get very from oil you valuation of shares and other asset classes and so on and you get equally enthusiastic use of Leverage. I had to do to get the results that you need at least in the short time. I saw the economy is moving on a on a did path. Right and this makes the whole thing very fragile and it's like some sort of apology. So we are with this connection. I believe this is quite obvious. The other problem that I mentioned is capital consumption all that that's less less obvious. Probably and what I have here in mind is that thanks to the printing press you no longer. You destroy a part of the incentives that push people to say, of course, you reduce the intent of to become self-reliant. It's only good food. I've been so on especially you reduce the incentive to save as a consequence. You are diminishing the capital base right now in real terms of the economy. Now the question is how strong is this effect? If you look at the official figures you might think well, it cannot be that strong because we still have increased of capital. Vested in real terms. I looked at the figures as found its true. So this is this is the impression that you get but then of course you also know that governments try to manipulate the figures themselves. And especially in this case the price inflation rate review. You are probably aware of the work of John Williams Shadows dance dados dad's right? So I've been following this for 15 years ago fascinating when I saw this, Because what he's doing is just providing estimates right is no because you don't have the raw data. He's just out of his own experiences just estimating the deviation between the calculated inflation rates with the current methodology and the inflation price inflation rate. That would be calculated with the prevailing methods in the 1980s. So he comes up with differentials of about 7% I think right right now right seven seven nine percent. Sometimes this is Its enormous it's just mind-boggling. So I read through macro economic statistics information about Capital Investments. And so on in the light of his figures and my conclusion was that if you if Williams in is right, then we have been consuming Capital concept is since the mid-1980s something like this and even if he is not entirely right, but it's only half right there probably will be consuming capital for the past 20 years in	0.0

Well, I guess 3500 for him at the NFR sell two years ago taking him to the National Finals twice and the other day at Sacramento PBR. They are Vieira was 89 on them want to short go on him, you know, and I know that that doesn't always work out like that. I'm not being trying to be naive either that that it always works out like that but like him or the bull jive turkey that they the other Brazilian boy rows are in the short goat Sacramento. I bought Josh Last year at the enough ourselves. I give 6,000 for him. He come from Toby Floyd and and that and he was like $89 88-89 on him a guy can put by a really damn good bull anymore.	1.0

I can't fix any of this no matter what you do and I think that's where anxiety gets tricky for people like us it's because it's like you can't fix it. Like when your dad was going through that there's there's nothing you can do and feeling powerless hmm to somebody like us who is very Very successful at fixing things.

To kill some of the flying creatures using Hank Marlo's Katana a in case you know what that is a gitanos a sword. And the skull crawler then set its eyes on Conrad and and reg slivko, but we were rescued them by tossing a lighter. I one of the Subterranean events creating an explosion that killed the skull color immediately. Then then the giant skull crawler which given the nickname scold devil was waked due to seismic explosive dropped on the Skull Island along with the rest of his kind after calling was incapacitated by Packard. It's called out the skull devil left. His presence be known by emerging. From the bed to the water thus and that began a three part about it what's called? I will have the upper hand on confidentially. And as he changed and as he chased James Conrad and the other survivors of the research that I've mentioned said to Skull Island Earl Cole tried to sacrifice himself by arming several grenades before having the massive creature tried to eat him to both creature up. However, it's called Apple didn't fall for this and he batted up against the cliff as a grenade went off killing him as the skull devil. Finally reached the rest of the crew calling appear to just in time to start with a large Boulder as the crew ran to safety and then the and then thus called overturns. Devil turned his focused to Kong counting on him and gripping his throat with his Jaws called in the skull devil could take them to brutally wrestle puddle and bite each other until the skull down Force Conga to a shipwreck with a blow from his tail where what he had came became entangled to the chains. I think that's a reference to the to of on King Kong film. And with conch subdued in the wreck, the massive skull down will return his Focus to the humans. And as he approached the crew once more the skull Devil's right.	0.0

Yeah, right but been for years but long as it's been an issue for ever like even esea pluggers, like I know like the legendary pluggers and esea that were just so sick and you brought you you and I probably can name off a few but yeah, but what happens is a lot of times those buggers can't perform in a team. If so, specialized their skill and pugs that they're so good at like go mid up every round exactly but we don't want that to happen. We want people to effectively put him to put be put into a roll.

So just remove any clutter from your living areas clear off the surfaces and the floors and then of course lastly you're going to want to sweep or vacuum the floors and there. And that's probably going to take the most of your time but it also probably causes the most impact as far as how your house looks having clean floors in your living areas, whether they're vacuumed or swept and mopped can make a huge difference in the appearance of your home. It'll definitely give you that bang for your buck people will be able to tell that you've cleaned, you know vacuuming and dusting is a big thing. So, Most of your time might be on vacuuming or picking up the floors. Most of your time might be spent on that. But since I can talk faster than you can clean. I'll give you some ideas of bonus chores in those areas and perhaps it's a day that you don't need to sweep or vacuum. Maybe your floors already look good some things that you can do are additional dusting. Maybe you need a desk some knickknacks a bookcase a piano. Maybe you have a window to wash - or you know something really occasional like dusting the baseboards. I've talked about this before but an easy way to dust your baseboards is to rubber band a microfiber cloth around the bottom of a broom and then just rub those baseboards or if they have a lot of buildup you might need to use a wipe. Our sponge or something like that and actually, you know you something wet, but if you keep it dusted you can prevent it from getting to grimy other bonus chores in the kitchen living areas.	0.0

Wild and blue? Yeah. Yeah. She's been every year since so I actually bought her from the guy here and right here outside of town a friend of mine named Chuck Norris. He raised he raised his bucking horses and does some high school college and it's Amateur rodeos and has a brief program himself and and I actually bought two members from him and I'm kind of think that year. I bought those murder. I'm gonna say I think I bought those mares from him and like, oh, wait right in there and and I bought wild and blue who herself, you know bucks bucks. Obviously really? Well, she'd been to the NF are all these years and then there was another mare that came with her and her name was His Indian summer. Well Indian summer, she's just an okay Bronk. But remember when I was talking about that consistency of being really solid she oh one of those kind she's solid. She's like a 1920 pointer every time and she her oldest cult I have is a bronc named Indian burn and I took him we've taken him to the finals the last two years. He went as a four-year-old and five-year-old. So and And I know you're playing with fire taking a four-year-old to the National Finals. But but he's just that good and anyway, so that that purchase worked out pretty good for us by an electric bears from Chuck. So, you know, we got a boy, you know a really good mare that produces Colton and one that bucks really well herself. So yeah, that's about what they sometimes it hits like that. Now I've got other stories I could tell you that didn't hit very good that one did so so kind of transition into the to the Bulls	1.0

I just don't think it matched the song. I think if it was a different song that it went with it would have won. I just it didn't make sense as soon as soon as she came out. I get that she was trying to do something different and show a different side of Trinity, which is fine. Fine, and I you know, and I encourage it but it should have been done with it. Just it didn't make sense for the song. It really truly didn't I mean if you can explain it to me and justify it I will take everything that I'm saying right now back, but you can't because it didn't fit the song. She didn't even like this in her 20s, at least she was in just in a dance costume and she just danced and she roll at least she rolled on the floor when they said you spin me right round like it made slack.

Yeah, they make sense for the Angels. Love that pairing makes as much sense for the Indians. I think the Angels would probably have to overpay just based on. Their system. It's such a weird. It's a weird thing anyway, because as we've talked about so many times like Obviously kluber does not have Peak trade value right now, you know, you're better off waiting six months or taking a time machine to go back a year or a year and a half. So you're asking a team to take on the contract and I know we've said like the contract is fine. As long as he turns out to be even an adequate picture but no one knows what he's going to be and so it's like you somehow still have to convince a team to give you a really useful piece. Otherwise, it makes more sense to just hold them. And the angels are weird team because they're so top-heavy and their farm system is a lot better than it was a few years ago. When it looks like Mike Trout was just gonna waste away like Tom Hanks in Castaway with Albert Pujols as Wilson, but it's I just made a movie reference like we hate document this podcast, but I think my name is void dumbass. That's that's a good reference. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what they eventually do with him because Because I think it's it's difficult to find if you're going to trade him.

Hey guys, really love the podcast a ton. The only thing that would make me love it more is if I could listen to it while wearing boxers slides really enjoy both of your guys content and personalities and the podcast is always really funny. The only thing that could be improved upon. Oh is if launders would finally give white cloth a chance and stop with his blind hatred of such a delicious drink Lacroix is also good, especially the tall Earth in cans with the to flavor. Did you just write the second would be angrier about his opinions? If you didn't have such a great bull cut all of you including Nathan because he needs more love.

Want to lose 10 pounds or more for most people it's toning losing body fat. Just being yeah, I would say that like more body composition wanting to and you know, 80% of all clientele are females. And so if you think about after pregnancy, if you think about how females invest in their lashes their nails their plastic surgery everything their hair, you know, they invest in their bodies and so but with males is a little different because you know, we go through Sports we have friends that we hang out with that we all gym and like Sigmund Freud said it like most males the reason why we exercise So it's sex-related. So he says like the reason why people want to drive fast cars are the reason why they want to buy nice shoes of the reason why they want to dress a certain way is because they want to attract other people. It's like something called pheromones. So yeah, it's very very interesting. So he says a lot of the decisions that we actually make the color that we want the body that we want or the kind of house or car or job. You know, there is kind of like sex-based kind of Interest Is pretty interesting, you know, but anyway back to Just Fitness and itself being a trainer for the past four years has saved my life it gave me a sense of purpose and I've dealt with a lot of drug addiction to the past and also dealt with you know, just finding my own security and life but personal training kind of just fell into my lap and it allowed me to do something greater than myself. So it was nice and Growing up are going to college you didn't study to be a nosy right now. I wanted to do a first, you know, I wanted to be a doctor but I didn't want to be a doctor. It was something that my parents wanted me to do. Yeah, you know and then as I started realizing what I really wanted to do, I just kind of went with my own instincts. There's that Jim Carrey thing that he said where ya know you can either live your life doing something that you kind of like doing and fail at that. Or you can live your life and do something that you love right and fail at that like at least go out with doing something that you love because you know, he talked about his dad and his dad just you know wasn't really living happy lives. Thanks for trying to find, you know purpose like what really drives you what gives you fulfillment in life. It's really just about service. It's about what you're doing for other people. That's what gives you like the most Joy before you're doing Fitness.	1.0

It seems like he built a really great product and can totally see retailers using a I just want to understand is this a 10 million hundred million billion 10 billion dollar Marty six billion dollar market. So, how do you so let me tell you how I would think about Market size images you say you're going after the Middle Market right 10 million 250 million hundred ten million 100 million in Revenue. I think about Market size is how many retailers exist in that sort of bucket. How many of them don't have an A. Nap and what's your sort of annual price per retailer really backing through to the market? I just worry that we're going after a nice hundred million dollar market but not a ten billion dollar market, excellent. So the total addressable addressable Market our addressable Market is 6 as 36 billion dollars currently right now, but you and that's yeah, you can't think you can't think of it as total retail Stan you got to think about it as what Revenue can we get from our Target? But he said that their issues billion years being spent by these retailers on mobile. If you look you're not going to get right you're gonna we're gonna work.	0.0

Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone and forcing yourself into something that's just not meant to be. Hmm. So I do believe it's up to the person to push themselves in a way where it still feels like overall. There's a positive benefit here, right? Because sometimes exercise does push us and it you don't always feel great and you should push yourself, but if you I truly think if you are tuned into yourself in a in a profound way. You can tell what's an exercise that is like comfortably pushing you to be better and stronger and something that's actually just going to hurt you or is just not right for your body. So again, it's up for each person to decide what what that is. I love that. I really love that.	1.0

I did touch on it before but when I was going through a by period in my business having to look at different income streams for staging so I created my packages and my style to stay service. So that was the first one and the second one and I think backup touched on this in her interview was that I had these staged a property and owner came back and said we had left scuffs all up and down the hall. We didn't and he never came back to me about it, but it was putting in a process of actually photographing the property before we even put Furniture into it so that we have evidence of anything that could go wrong afterwards. Yeah, that's it.	0.0
