2	Welcome to the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host Jake shorter. And today I am joined by Jessica Dwyer of right at home staging which is located on the sapphire Coast in New South Wales. There's a couple of things in particular probably three that I found really interesting about this interview. The first one is that just is located in her business is located in a very Regional or even rural area and I guess we talked about some of the difficulties that she faces as part of that and I know that she's not alone in that in around Australia. We also talked about The fact that the her staging business is only one of two businesses that she runs she actually has a retail physical retail store as well. So I talked a bit about how that fits in with her staging business how it complements it and also the difficulties in running two businesses at the same time. And the third one that we get into is a little bit of an online shop idea that she's had to help increase or add another revenue streams part of her staging business and in particular she has set up a dream packages. That she sells locally to various people and and I found it really interesting. And I know that she's not alone in setting up an online store as a another source of Revenue. So we kind of talked about her thoughts behind it and what she has found very successful and difficult in saying that up. She also finishes, I guess the interview with an answer to my question which I often ask but don't get a great answer which is what is something weird or unusual that you love actually has a really good answer which I actually do the same thing. Going to tell you what it is yet. You have to listen to the end to get that but I suspect its more common than we both or then she realized I think it's actually probably more common in the general population. So listen and let me know how you go with that one. Enjoy the episode. Okay, I'm joined today by just for Dwight from right at home staging. How are you going? Yes, I'm good. Thank you Jake. How are you? Very well, welcome to the show.	1.0
1	Thanks for having me.	1.0
2	Glad to have you here. We did meet recently at the symposium. Dan in Sydney for the first time so that was kind of the first time that we met face-to-face and now we get to talk a little bit. I think what most of our interactions as they would be with most others in the industry are online and social media. So it's kind of nice to be do something a bit different.	1.0
1	I know when I saw baby in Sydney, I felt like I already knew her because we constantly are watching you on Instagram. So it's kind of nice, you know to finally meet in person and you're one that likes	1.0
2	To get in front of camera as you're doing things that I'm going to get into a little bit of that. But before we do that, I want to go right back to the start and ask what were you doing? Just before you got into the home staging industry.	0.0
1	I was living in Sydney working in corporate as a project manager.	0.0
2	Like I'm so completely different fields in you talking about kind of the the big industrial type projects or what sort of projects that we are you talking about so more	0.0
1	Technical so I was implementing EHR systems into lens Elise. And so I got into implementing EHR systems in quite a few of my previous roles. So it kind of just became my little niche and I think that's where I am quite good with all the technical side of things in business because that's my background.	1.0
2	Completely different to what you doing now for sure.	0.0
1	I know you're right. But I think the project management side of things does help me because it makes you be very organized and structured in how you complete projects.	1.0
2	So and probably just the eye and the fact that you're kind of used to thinking about things in a big picture and knowing where each of each little piece fits into that overall equation.	0.0
1	Yeah hundred percent.	1.0
2	Yeah cool as I Mention your business is called right at home staging and you're down on the sapphire Coast. Now, I now after meeting you in Sydney know where that is, but I didn't before that. So I don't just for in cases those listening that don't know whether Sapphire Coast is tell us where that is. And then I guess also how large of an area you your business covers.	1.0
1	Yes those the sapphire Coast is halfway between Sydney and Melbourne on the coast and the sapphire Coast is a collection of smaller. Pounds there is actually don't know the number of people in this area, but there is there is quite a few towns probably around ten towns that make up the sapphire coast. Probably even more actually actually feel that I should know that statistic. I'm sorry.	-1.0
2	That's okay people can go and Google that and I guess how it when I talk about how far you have to travel is that what's the furthest you've had to travel for maybe to Stage your house.	0.0
1	Well the sir. Bicoastal, so I started at Burma gooey and I end it at Eden. So the distance from biggity-boom Acuity or even is around 45 minute drive. I have gone further up the coast path / McGeary to town called narooma and down many which is kind of a little bit further than that 45 minutes, but that's probably the proximity because any further and removalist costs as you would know increase so I try and keep A bit in that Circle. Okay, very good.	1.0
2	And I guess in terms of that, you know back in the early days when the business started. Was there anything in particular like a moment or was it more of a series of events that actually led to the decision to start the business?	0.0
1	Yeah, so it wasn't series of events. So my contractor Lend-Lease was coming to an end my lease at my unit in could you was coming to an end? And in all of that I had been following the twins from The Block on Instagram and I then say that they went and did some home staging course with this International Institute a home staging which was quite new to me. So then I am International Institute of home staging put on kind of a seminar in Sydney back in 2015, and I just thought I'll just go and see what it's all about. And that literally was my lightbulb moment. This is actually what I want to do for the rest of my life is home staging so there was a series of events and I think the universe kind of led me to that seminar that Naomi had put on in Sydney back in 2015. And the rest is history So within that three months of attending that seminar I was back in Beaker and rather home staging was born that's amazing how quickly it's happened.	1.0
2	So 20 2015. I said yeah about four years on now, I guess give us a little bit of so that's kind of that going back right to the start. So in the roughly for odd years that you've been in business to kind of tell me a little bit about well, maybe start with where the business is at now just to give people listening a bit of context. So, you know any sort of numbers that you can share, you know, the number of houses staged or how many properties you look after employees anything anything at all that can give a bit of context.	0.0
1	Yeah, so Nearly four years and I think I've got about Well Properties staged at the moment and that could be a combination of vacant or occupied homes. I do work closely with quite a few real estate agents in the area and I do have a couple of casual employees that helped me when I do have the larger jobs the vacant properties. So yeah, it's it's	0.0
2	Ring well, it's very exciting. And I guess it's something that I was a little bit naive probably being in Brisbane in the capital city. We had plenty of options when we started for hiring Furniture. So that that wasn't a limitation, you know, it was our real limitation was how much what you know, what happened we quickly could we build relationships with agents how quickly could we actually win some work and whatever work we were able to win it was either going to be constrained by you know, how many employees we had or how you know how we're going to actually fulfill. The orders whereas now I've met more people from Regional centers or rural sort of places something that didn't even cross. My mind was that there aren't even options to hire furniture and a lot of those places is that was that the case for you?	1.0
1	Yeah it was and so when I first started right at home staging I went into it thinking I'll just do pre-sale consults and I'll just get my experience through that but very very quickly. I realized that people wanted their In properties furnished and so I had to then go and every job I got where I needed Furniture. I would just buy for that house and it has just accumulated over time, but I don't have any higher options. I think Canberra is probably the closest and that's 3 hours away. So in a regional area, it is a huge investment at the beginning to grow your inventory and I have no regrets like I absolutely love it. But yeah, you do have to act like quite a lot. Yeah, no, definitely an egg because you've got your own stock.	1.0
2	Yeah and look so we kind of dismayed that decision to go down that path but we definitely had kind of a backup option there. But as I said, but yeah speaking to people from even Newcastle similar sort of thing there be closer to Sydney. So maybe they have some options there but hiring it's just almost taken for granted maybe or at least I took it for granted a little bit, but I guess as a follow-on Are there any other particular difficulties that you kind of face or that maybe we don't we're not aware of being in a couple of city that you faced in Regional areas.	0.0
1	Storage is an issue. So attending the Symposium recently instead need hearing the storage company get up on stage and talk about how they can offer all these things to stages. Like we just don't have any of that down here and I'm sure in a lot of regional areas don't have that access. So storage is quite expensive down here removalists are expensive. So I've been lucky to find a couple of guys who do Up me, they're not a furniture removal us as such with the truck, but they are very good to me and they do look after my friend nature when we are moving it. But also the biggest challenge that I've found is is actually educating people about what home staging actually is in the area when I first started right at home staging II overheard my dad telling someone what right at home staging was all about and he got it completely wrong, so I had to tell my parents It's like basically gave them a script on what home staging does so and to this day I still find it's an education piece with everybody on home staging and how it can benefit them when they're selling their home, which is a very yeah, I agree and it's it could be quite difficult because you not only selling yourself.	-1.0
2	Now, you're also having to First even like say educate what what your service is what you do and then it's well, why am I the best person to provide that and often that can just be a road like this? This I mean in every city everybody will come across the same thing. I'm sure but like we've found over the last couple of years. It's certainly come a long way in terms of the number of agents who are now styling more than they don't. Whereas along when we started we certainly saw a lot of agents who were you know, the number of times I heard all we don't need that to sell a house, you know, I'll sell the house myself. And yes, I can imagine that in Rich happen. Yeah.	-1.0
1	Ever done it in the city, but I imagine it would be a little bit harder. But also I'm finding now that my clients are actually asking for staging when they go to their real estate agent or they're they're coming to me directly before they've even listed with an agent to get staging. So yeah, I'm slowly slowly infiltrating. You know that whole education piece. It's a slow burn.	1.0
2	Definitely. Alright. Well look we kind of I know how much time and energy goes into starting and most and and money goes into starting and then running a staging company trying to build it, but that's not the only thing you have going on. You're also the owner or co-owner of a brick-and-mortar retail shop called the Hub home Trader I think is the name there. So tell me a little bit about that business and kind of how and why that was started.	1.0
1	So I like I had started right at home staging in. And just as I'd move back to be you this home where Shop opened up and it was amazing. I would go there and buy pieces for staging and then 12 months later or less the owner put it up for sale and my cousin just off the cuff said maybe we should buy it. That's what we did. We went in and we bought this home where shop and it actually is a real blessing in disguise for right at home staging because I can access A lot of products through the shop and also they kind of a good advertising for either side of the business. So if I use some art in runner home staging, you know, you can buy through the Hub so good cross promotion and it's a it's another creative outlet for me when I'm not staging so I really love it.	1.0
2	And I guess you're like you said, they're very complementary businesses. But at the end of the day, they're still two separate businesses and different. In the in the sense that although the obviously there's some crossover in the fact that you've got home Wares and things that you can use in staging as well one is still a retail store and one is a service. How do you find running two businesses that are very different at the same time?	0.0
1	It can be very tiring. I do sometimes find it quite mentally draining because there is so many things that you need to do as a business owner and so for me, that's kind of doubled in both businesses. I'm my cousin Amanda who owns The Hub with me we have found it quite difficult because we've never run a retail shop before and at the moment retail is in a recession in Australia. It's very quiet, but it is quite tiring at times but also very rewarding as cliché as that sounds I don't I couldn't imagine my life without either business.	-1.0
2	This is like one of those questions who's your favorite kid, but any any preference? Oh, yeah. Yeah.	0.0
1	Me will always be my favorite child. Like I have I have Big Dreams for right at home staging and the Hub just comes in as a really nice complementary side business. Yeah, there's no there's no secret about that. Who's my favorite child?	1.0
2	Very good. Well, maybe I'll touch on that comment that the Big Dreams for the business at the end. But before I go into that something that's kind of related in a way to the retail side or the or the fact that there's almost this second business or what what I'm seeing in the industry from particularly from some of the staging businesses who have been in business for a little while and looking to add other revenue streams. I'm seeing little online stores pop-up not too common. But I've seen a few come up on the websites and and look it does make sense given that we do all this research when we're sourcing the Quality Furniture and we can often get better pricing through trade discounts or wholesale pricing. So I understand it and I think you've kind of done this in a clever way. Not only that you've got the That we just talked about but you also have done I guess it kind of an online just store but you've specifically called them bedroom packages and you've set up it this online store to sell what is essentially Furniture but in a bedroom package and I haven't seen that done quite the same anywhere else. So I you know, I'm really interested in the thought process behind or you know, how you came about deciding to do something like this or testing it out and kind of how you found it.	1.0
1	So The thought came about because that at one point I can't even remember when I launched the bedroom packages, but if this was quiet and I needed to create another income stream because when you're not staging properties, you need to find that how you've got to pay your bills, right? So I thought these bedroom packages would be a really nice idea because I had clients that would say to me. Oh, I just want you. Come in and transform my bedroom and just do it. I'll pay you so I kept getting these little hints from people. So I thought I'll try and make it a reality and it's a really simple concept that you can purchase a bedroom accessory pack and instantly your bedroom is made over with beautiful art and cushions and lights and it was really well received and I then started working on living room accessory packs. Kind of a similar idea. We just add the artwork in the cushions and the lamps but it all is in a theme.	1.0
2	So hopefully that will be launched soon and I guess going back to my be the overall online store idea because I've seen other ones where similar sort of things but bedroom packs around the furniture more than just the the kind of the lighter or the smaller pieces and look. I don't have any experience at all. But my initial response to when I see those is I'm a little Little about how well they would actually do not because it's about I think it's a great idea, but I often wonder what I look at those, you know, some of the prices for the full living room pack or Furniture whether there's actually much demand out there and and given that there's actually a lot of competition as you say retail is can is struggling on this at the moment. I imagine that's the case online as well and I guess it in an of a selfish it could be a time business, but it's kind of sitting as a second priority to for the most of These staging businesses as a second or complementary part of their business. So I guess I'm just wondering if somebody has no idea at all how well these things are near you've just said that you just received quite well. Have you found that it's something that buyers are all I guess. What do you think about others who are doing similar sort of things but in a Furniture space, do you think that they're actually going to be something that given our industry? It's actually received were Lords in demand or or my kind of missing the point a bit.	1.0
1	I think it's hard for me to say. Terms of buying a whole furniture package because they're I don't imagine they would be many people out there who would have no furniture to begin with maybe they just want to replace their lounge or their coffee table. That's why I think accessories are a lot easier to replace in a room as opposed to replacing your whole bed and bedside tables but also from where I'm coming from because I'm a regional person that shipping for me. He is very expensive. So I don't offer shipping for my bedroom packages. You would need to be a local to pick them up because shipping is just too expensive. I think probably in the cities the bedroom packages would probably work and be a bit more in demand. But yeah, it's hard. It's hard for me to say.	-1.0
2	Yeah, it's and I should clarify. It's AI think it's a great idea it like I've potentially interested in looking into some sort of version of an And Shop, whatever form that takes. I'm just always every time but I've kind of always thought about it or talked about it. We kind of went back and said I don't know if that even is something that would work. So I mean it's interesting to what's good to hear that for yourself in the area or in that it has been received well, and it's just maybe somebody out there needs to try it and maybe we'll keep watch with interest.	1.0
1	Yeah. Well, I know quite a few home stages that have created that other Avenue of fairness. Fishing and styling airbnb's or holiday lips and I think maybe those complete bed furniture package is probably would complement that nicely if they are having to do an empty Air B&B. But yeah, I guess they changed cool.	1.0
2	Alright getting toward the end here and I guess now we're kind of looking a little bit more in retrospect or reflecting on your time. So as you said nearly four years in business, what would you say has been the most difficult thing that you've had to deal with?	0.0
1	And take that as broad or as narrow as you'd like, I think I think I spoke about it before was just educating people. I did find that quite a struggle at the beginning trying to even get in front of real estate agents and convince them that home staging was a benefit to them and it would help them sell properties faster. So that that's probably been my biggest hurdle and it's Still ongoing today.	-1.0
2	Did you ever in the early days when cuz imagine that was even more difficult in the early days when you're still learning how to actually talk about it and educate did you ever think about quitting or no stopping what you're doing and changing into something different.	-1.0
1	Not at all. No, no, and I still don't. I feel like I'm on a mission now to like take this business to the next level and just keep winning over real estate agents and winning over clients like trying to get to the clients before they get to the real estate agents if that makes sense.	1.0
2	Yep. So I guess going in talking about us a you mentioned Big Dreams before and take it to the next level. I'll that'll be my next question. But before I ask that one what are some of the things that you've noticed that are changing in our industry and in home?	0.0
1	Beijing in say call it the last six or 12 months, I think from where I sit just looking at say it Instagram the amount of home staging businesses that are popping up because it's such a new industry. I think it's becoming a lot more accepted as the way to Market your property when you're selling it you have pretty good of that that would have to be is yep.	1.0
2	Now that's that's yeah. I think I think I mentioned before you know in the last two years, especially I've seen the change in agents attitudes towards it but at the same time there's been a lot more businesses and people entering the industry and especially in Capital Cities. I think it's it's a very low barrier to actually enter the industry given you have these higher options or you know, I'm simplifying at a lot. So I'm being overly simplistic, but it is as simple as You can convince somebody to use you to style their home. You can do it tomorrow, you know, you can you can go to a higher company if you're in a capital city and you don't have to own anything. You don't have to actually outlay any costs other than your time obviously to build a business beyond that takes a lot more commitment and energy and cats and all those things. But you know in terms of setting up day one to test it's very easy to actually put your toe in the water if you were to go and like and I should also clarify that and say, you know, it took us a couple of Months before or phone calls and meetings before got our first job. So it's not as simple as that, but you know in I guess as you say young industry with low barrier to at least enter in the early years, it makes sense that we're seeing a lot of businesses pop up.	1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, that's great. Well, I really love following all the different businesses on Instagram and watching them grow. You just reminded me of something that I was in my early. Sighs I did make contact with a lot of real estate agents and I didn't hear from a few of them and then at least 12 months later one of them replied to my email. So it's like they kind of knew were there but they didn't really need you with that time or they weren't really convinced. You could help them at that time that they they eventually came around. So it's a nice like pass very slow burn slow so bad. Yeah.	1.0
2	Alright Luke. I've kind of touched on a couple times. Let's ask the question. So you mentioned Big Dreams and take	0.0
1	The Next Step, what are your will you kind of thinking for your business as you look forward over the next 12 months five years what you know, tell us a little bit about what you've got coming like I don't have any solid plans, but you know when you visualize where you would be in five years, I do visualize my own truck my own Vans full time employees a massive Warehouse full of furniture and it's just a simple as that. We're a really well oiled machine of a business that He's in high demand on the sapphire Coast. That's a simple as what my dream is sometimes simple is better.	1.0
2	And I mean that's I think you'd better wouldn't be alone in what you've just described for a lot of businesses including ours in our own kind of little area.	1.0
1	Yeah, I mean small businesses tough enough. So I think you'd be keep it as simple as that then it can be I feel like it's achievable.	1.0
2	I don't think so. I mean you've talked about how much you've grown in four years. And I mean you obviously know the area well, so I think it's you know with as you say the industry is growing and changing and more agents are believing in staging the benefits. So yeah great great vision, I guess to set yourself.	1.0
1	He's off come back in five years and we can have will be what are we watching?	0.0
2	All right. Look, I'm we're down to just the rapid fire questions. I've got a few here. I do tend to Take longer than I want to but takers as quick or as long as you need for these questions and I will try not to interrupt or drawn out any longer than it needs to. Alright. So the first one is how has a failure or an apparent failure at the time set you up for a later success.	0.0
1	So I think I thought about this one and that there's two things that I want to say is that the first one is mine. I did touch on it before but when I was going through a by period in my business having to look at different income streams for staging so I created my packages and my style to stay service. So that was the first one and the second one and I think backup touched on this in her interview was that I had these staged a property and owner came back and said we had left scuffs all up and down the hall. We didn't and he never came back to me about it, but it was putting in a process of actually photographing the property before we even put Furniture into it so that we have evidence of anything that could go wrong afterwards. Yeah, that's it.	-1.0
2	That's a good one. I'm sure that people listening will take that last bit of advice. Especially I'm sure we're not the only one that's had that okay. I yeah, it's like Could say more but I won't supposed to be fast. What is one of the best pieces almost worthwhile Investments that you've made whether that's time manage money energy anything like that.	1.0
1	Yeah again, I had a good thing about this one and I always just kept coming back to branding and I think this comes back to my corporate days where Brandon is so important the corporate company that I made sure that my brand was Sit up and it was consistent from the get-go. So, you know graphic design website all that stuff that kind of ties your whole brand concept together. It's probably one thing that I've been very mindful of since I registered my business name back in 2015.	1.0
2	How does this is a know? I said, I wouldn't do this but a little side question when you talk about branding as I mentioned before that you like to get in front of camera, and I've noticed on your website. Everything you're not shy about putting your face and telling people who you are, which I love I love them and I say it all the time to people people buy from people. So, I believe that letting people know who you are and what you're about can only be a benefit in your business. How are you? How does that tie into your branding?	1.0
1	So someone said to me once which I never forgot was that branding isn't just about your logo on your website. It's actually about you you the brand of your business and people want to see you. And they want to hear your story and they want to see how you can transform and that room from a vacant to a beautifully stubbed property. So I like I've not always been game enough to put my face onto Instagram stories. It's just something that I realized that people I actually got a lot more traction when I was being real and honest on camera, and I'm not shy to show the warts and all of home staging it isn't just about that beautiful. Sad room at the end of the day and I yeah, I think people really appreciate that but also in such a small Regional area. I think it's it's really good to put your face out there as well because people then just build that trust with you and your brand I guess. Yep couldn't agree more.	1.0
2	Okay couple to go. What advice do you wish you'd had when you started your business.	0.0
1	I probably would have started tracking my inventory from Okay, I started buying so much furniture and accessories that at the time I think it was you just get so carried away in how busy your business is and you know, you're trying to fill the many hats that you need to are in a small business that I just left. I didn't do an inventory list, so it wasn't until last year. I think it was where I actually started getting serious about documenting everything that right. At home staging had acquired over the four years to make my life easier because when you're standing in your shares and you need you know, 12 Euro pillows and three sets of bedside lamps and you've got no idea if you have those available or not. It's really hard.	-1.0
2	So getting really organized with what you've purchased think that's a topic that could take up an entire podcast episode additional.	0.0
1	There's so many times. I've gone to the shops and bought things that I didn't need to buy because As they were sitting in one of the sheds that I could have used any way.	0.0
2	Yeah are enough. What is a bad piece of advice or a recommendation that you've heard in the home staging industry a piece of advice something for for people to maybe avoid or at least if they hear this some advice from that you would consider not be the best advice something that they would at least be a bit critical when they think about it.	0.0
1	Oh my gosh, I I actually have a blank on this one. I think maybe two sides of the coin from a client's perspective. This may not be answering your question directly Jake but from a client perspective their perception of home staging it could be quite an expensive investment or them and they might not want to spend that money to Stage a home to sell but then on the flip side. The home stages I guess wanting to come into the industry that it isn't there is so much more Blood Sweat and Tears involved in in home staging then just, you know, making a bed and fluffing pillows. Yeah, there's so much more involved. I think that's probably all I can give you at them.	0.0
2	That's okay. I'll take it. And the last one I have is what is it unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love and this one I have to say that I haven't had a good track. Or with this question in the past. So I'll see how we go.	1.0
1	So on the television when you turn up the volume, I always have to make sure the volume is on an even number. I can't have it on and off I'm with you on that.	0.0
2	I do that all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure I'm sure that's actually more common than you think. I would actually that's a question for anyone listening if you actually do that, cuz I'm sure I'm convinced that that is more normal than we realize.	1.0
1	I feel like it would be and it's probably this. I meet people who make sure that they have to use like two or four pegs in there hanging out the washing no odd numbers. It doesn't make the sound of the TV any different there's it's just makes you feel better about what exactly yeah.	1.0
2	No, I like it. I like it. Alright last question is the easiest and that is where can people who want to follow along with your journey and what you're doing or even reach out and ask a question. What's the best place for people to do that?	1.0
1	So So Facebook or Instagram, I'm just found under right at home staging or my website right at home staging dot-com. I you excellent.	1.0
2	Alright, just well. Thank you very much for being on the show, and I hope the listeners got something out of it. And as I said if you're listening at home, and you firstly if you do that thing with the volume where it's got to be on an even number, I'd love to know the second Leaf. Please reach out and let just know that you listened and if you have any questions follow up with her, but thank you again Jess.	1.0
1	Thanks so much for having me Jake. Jake	1.0
