It's called big facts podcast re trying but it was cool. So we did it. It's set for a comedy. We're trying to do more of a PG-13 type things for all audiences. We're going to keep swearing down to a minimum. They're going to we're trying to keep it around a 30 minutes for each podcast, but if it gets into like a good heated discussion and we start arguing about stuff not or not saying we're going to end in 30 minutes, but I'm probably keep going to be honest. Keep it going also as of right now if you want you can also subscribe keep listening and we should be on other things like Spotify. We're gonna probably be on Apple Google Play anything where you can listen. Those are the most popular ones. But yeah, so we're going to get right into the podcast. We have some	1.0
3	great topics actually today so I can already hear a few.	1.0
1	I am right now so I have to like I'm traveling but when I'm not traveling we most likely be getting together and doing the podcast together. So some of them will have better audio. We're probably at some point if this gets popular enough for we get long enough into it, we might buy a better microphone were together and use that but for now, we're doing this this way because it's the best we got so Ricky G or day if you have any ideas for what you want to do for our first topic of discussion today.	-1.0
3	I want to talk about times. Cartoons predicted the future of already got it loaded up pretty weird one gone here.	0.0
1	Alright, so If you guys don't know already if you've watched any favorite TV shows like Simpsons family guy Futurama American Dad. I don't know if they really predicted anything. Yeah stuff like cartoons. Yeah older cartoons. Yeah, all these cartoons and all these shows have actually had an addiction to something that happened in the future a couple years after the show like that episode as are Simpsons they think the creator of it is a time traveler, which would make sense. He's predicted like 18 to 20 things. And hold like life work like doing it. One of the biggest ones was the Mitt Romney thing where he was trying to vote for Obama and it kept going it was the machine that kept voting for Mitt Romney. There's that one. They predicted 9/11 early so that it was that they are becoming president. Yeah, that one they predicted 16. No. Yes, 16 years. They had the exact same place. He was at like as it was happening all the other thing they predicted which was really interesting was the God particle. I don't know if you guys know that one, but they had like Homer Simpson was writing on a board and he had I guess it was really close to the exact equation that was used to Sorry for the actual God particle, and I don't know how I don't know about me. But you put that together that if it says that close to the God particle, you might have you might be thinking something. You know what I mean? Like it's not part of God Particle because I have no idea.	1.0
3	What a God Particle is.	0.0
1	Well, it's I'll just explain real fast, but it has its particle that like start of the universe the Big Bang.	0.0
3	Once you have a quick suggestion, yeah, what's your suggestion? Probably shouldn't talk about that because there could be listeners who are religious.	-1.0
1	We weren't talking too much. And yeah, this is this is nothing. Yeah. I was just I was just playing with the God particle was it's not I'm not getting into the religion part of the I was just saying how they predicted that equation. Of course that that was not just a sense of either.	-1.0
3	There's a cartoon an old cartoon Hey Arnold and the Rebecca we're standing in a classroom. Blackboard and writing on Chalk written in chalk on the Blackboard where the words stay woke and underneath that was some coordinates not. I'm years later at those exact coordinates. Bin Laden was found shot to death.	-1.0
1	Yeah, so great. So these cartoons that were like predicting parts of the future now, I don't know if it's you guys but like at this point in time, I think I'm starting to watch them since a lot more just to see like If they can if they're going to predict anything else about the future, you know what I mean? Like I've been starting to watch The Simpsons more because you know, if they predicted 20 things they're mostly can be a good something else in the oven. So that was the topic of discussion for that while we're on the topic. Anyways, anyone have a favorite like cartoon they watch	1.0
3	The guy got a good old Jack Horseman is my favorite cartoon. Pretty cool.	1.0
1	That is not bad at all.	1.0
3	SpongeBob's the classic.	1.0
1	That's a class. It's like you seem like a normie if you're going to talk about SpongeBob, you know what I mean? Cause like that's just like wonderful back to you if you just say I watched SpongeBob, okay, but everyone watched one fathers and so if it's your favorite like that's true at least once or twice. Yeah. Like Regular Show or something like that and that's interesting. You know, I mean regular so I eventually time was good.	-1.0
3	But I feel like they fell off near the end, you know, I mean they because their age group was like 12 to like 14 and by the time that it like like got to its peak it definitely fell off because all of the viewers got older and yeah,	-1.0
1	Well, I don't I don't even think it's that I feel like Cartoon Network was is rushing their older shows to end so they can get New Orleans on like I feel like any old show that was on Cartoon Network's offended all forgetting a very important part to what Rick and Morty.	-1.0
3	Oh, okay. You can okay.	0.0
1	You can enjoy Rick and Morty and all right, but when they come out with a new season It takes forever. They grandly put them out like it's not even like a season like it doesn't come in order like every year. It's like randomly done.	-1.0
3	Actually. They just got an order for like three more seasons.	0.0
1	Okay, so then maybe now they'll come in they'll come faster.	1.0
3	But I mean if I remember correctly, I believe I remember Rick at the end of an episode shouting nine more seasons or something.	0.0
1	That's a prediction. It sounds like Okay, so, you know when we did a Szechuan sauce, I was so sad that I didn't not get any like I went there and I was waiting for the time because they said oh yeah 2 p.m. Is when we'll be putting it people got out of me for that. Like he got a 6:00 a.m. They were giving it out when they weren't supposed to I was a little pissed I kind of wanted to taste it isn't it? Like duck sauce for something isn't like really not or sweet and sour sauce. Yeah.	-1.0
3	So can we talk about something a lot of the Cartoon Network cartoons, you know Adventure Time the Gravity Falls the hepatic artery.	0.0
1	That's what every guy would involve a lot of whatever but cartoons like that.	1.0
3	They had a lot of potential especially with Gravity Falls. Yeah, like I was just kind of time thinking I was here. They had a lot of potential to have a lot deeper of the storyline than they did exactly.	-1.0
1	That's actually Grand Falls did In Gravity Falls was like if you were really into it there they put secret messages and stuff. They had like a lot of things actually at the end of the at the end of the show. If you were when they were on the bus, there's like a secret message and you pee decoded it. It said something and then a guy posted something on a store on his Twitter later and like a year later and it was like a whole scavenger hunt set up by the person through the show. So and then like it was interesting actually.	1.0
3	You like all of the seasons before the finale on Disney XD and I was I was like Loki sad because I was like damn this was a great show and it's about to be gone.	-1.0
1	They only did one season, right?	0.0
3	They know Gravity Falls got a couple of things they did not do three.	-1.0
1	I think they only did like two seasons. They weren't very for some reason. They were really good show but I'm surprised it only didn't like to season and then they took it off.	1.0
3	Well part of the reason a lot of these shows aren't getting enough time to Like progress the story is because streaming is like taking over the game right now. That is true. Yeah, really putting a lot of operating on our TV channels and such that's on Netflix. Like a lot of stuff is on Netflix and Hulu know and those things that people would rather see then stuff that's on actual.	-1.0
1	All right. All right. Well, I'll let me bring this up. I think able companies are actually It's going to it's going to do a cycle and come back to cable companies. I can tell you this right now because so many different types of streaming services are coming up and they're taking all their shows basically off of Netflix and they're like, okay. Well now you have to get our streaming service fee and watch the show. So, okay. I want to watch Friends. They're gonna probably take that off at some point and they're going to go to a special streaming for that like thing. You want to watch any Disney thing. I have to get the distant screaming now, but I want to watch that.	-1.0
3	Its original so now I have Disney and I have Netflix original that's already what $14 along with frickin like you've got Disney right that it's got like all the Marvel movies, right? Yeah. Now you you've got DC entertainment when they're like dumb expensive. They're like 20 bucks a month. I'm like, yeah, see I feel like because I mean I haven't had a cable for like seven years and I know what a lot of other people don't have cable anymore either because honestly, it's just become Obsolete and I know streaming is definitely having a decline right now just because you're still meant it like the oversaturation. Yeah and stuff, but I don't think it's gonna Circle back to Cable. I feel like there's gonna be some something new like kill them.	-1.0
1	That yeah. Yeah, I can see that.	1.0
3	Well, I mean, I mean we're already starting to get that aren't we? I see these that have like Hulu or Netflix built right into them.	0.0
1	I mean, yes, okay, but I mean you can do you YouTube TV technically would be it you get you to bread and then you can actually watch TV with it which that would be the closest to streaming and but that's streaming and obviously like Netflix like like here's what I'm thinking like some time. Not maybe like in the near future, but in the future future, I'm feeling like maybe like Netflix and Verizon team up like and collaborate that I don't I don't I would not want to eat like a cable company teaming up with us big streaming service, you know what I mean? Because like cables already pretty big they make a lot of money off phones and stuff their phones for different thing. Yeah, but I mean like it's that's still part of strain can still get your streaming stuff on the phone.	-1.0
3	So it's like all right, you know, you gotta kind of pity Netflix. I mean that took yeah, they're massive.	-1.0
1	They're not they're not gonna do so I can know you see them.	-1.0
3	I mean big already Netflix is already having such a major Decline and I know they took a lot of shows off and they said it was because they wanted to focus more on Netflix originals, which I get. Put you should do that. That's what killed them. Yeah, yeah. Yeah old shows or just like that just watching cartoons or anything like a Netflix took a lot of those kinds of shows off. I mean I went on to this day. I want to watch one of my favorite shows lost. Right? Yeah, it's 12 slots and that puts all the time. It's a really good show and then I went out and it was gone. Yes egg egg whites been on the books for years.	-1.0
1	All right.	0.0
3	White Chicks was on Netflix. Oh my God. So yeah, and then they took it off and I was like white chicks was like wait, no white chicks watch a movie or religiously White Chicks. Movie with the two cops that like dressed up as the women, right? Yeah or something else. Yeah. Yeah that movie was so funny facts. I watched it so many times I know real anymore and they took all the like the Defenders all these like I don't like Family Guy, it's not enough anymore. Yeah, and I know a lot of you guys are fans stranger things. season 3	-1.0
1	903 I love stranger things.	1.0
3	He is in one right? I got really into it and then see some to don't came out watch like the first episode and I just never really got back into it, but I kind of want to know because I haven't really heard much about it, but I know a lot of people have really liked Lost there.	1.0
1	all right time for a second time first thing you guys don't try to talk over each other because it's like when you guys talk over each other it's not as good so	-1.0
3	Yeah, yeah try not to do that.	-1.0
1	I can I can do that just because it's off my recording for my voice but you guys can't because it's going to like for you guys so that's what that's gonna be in the corny, but that's okay. So we spent about like 13 minutes on this topic. Would you guys like to move on to the next topic? You can finish what you you can finish your thing? Might as well.	-1.0
3	So that's how that's how it is with most TV shows that are on Netflix though. Like for example, I know like people are like, oh breaking bad. I started it got to like season 2 and then I like went to a different show and started watching that like that's what ever does is they'll start a show on Netflix watch to like the second or third season and if there's more than that, then they kind of lose interest and go to a different show and then come back to that show later. You know, I'm saying that's All right on the cycle, I guess.	-1.0
1	Okay. So I want to do some would you rather questions are we have time it's halfway about through our podcast maybe a little longer.	0.0
3	We can go a little longer and cover only got four of them. It'll probably take about two or three.	0.0
1	That's fine. Okay, Ricky hit us up with the first would you rather?	1.0
3	So what we're going to do is I'll ask a question and all three of us will give a nice. Okay, the first question would you rather? Either be a teenager for never experienced your childhood. So basically start life at 18 with no recollection of any childhood or any experience.	1.0
1	I would actually so either be a teenager. Or wait start your life without being without a childhood or be a teenager.	1.0
3	Wait, say it again be a teenager for never experienced like your childhood and teenage years. So basically come into the world at 18 with no experience, but still, you know, the maturity of an 18 year old.	-1.0
1	Alright, so you become a teenager right away. Okay, I'm going to have to be with the one where teenager.	1.0
3	How about you David?	0.0
1	I'm gonna say I'm gonna say teenager because a childhood is what makes someone you know, yeah, you're an idiot that growing as we go with the option to actually I would skip my childhood and go right into 18 because I've now I could mean yeah, I could see this being like I guess it depends on like your situation how you grew up to be honest, but if you had a As her to like, okay, I'm answering 17. But like if I guess if you know if your life was going to be good that you probably want to do it have a Teenage life. But if you know, it's not going to be good. Let's just skip that and go right to being an adult. You know what I mean?	-1.0
3	Yes, I am ready to be 18 get out of my house and just be done with all that to him you stopped. So I would start off 18 or skip all that. This one is the opposite end of it. It's not thoughtful at this makes you cringe OMG you rather eat a whole bowl of cockroaches or one hold. Both of them are wrong.	-1.0
1	Wait.	0.0
3	Say it again eat a bowl of roaches like cockroaches. Yeah for eat a whole rack for both of them are raw.	0.0
1	Both are raw brat. No, wait a minute. Let me think this through I'm definitely going to go matter see no matter which one you eat. You're most likely going to it's probably going to get you stick.	-1.0
3	And so don't worry about don't like don't think about sickness or anything will say immediately afterwards you go to the hospital and get great antibiotics all that, you know the eating part which was you rather have to suffer through. I would rather suffer through I could probably eat a rat I would do a red because a rat it's like a wonderful thing. And once you're done with it, you're done with the I feel like with cockroaches or multiple. Love them and you have to experience it like over and over again until you finish the bowl when we eating for it's a it's a bowl or just say one a bowl of cockroaches. So say oh yeah later time.	1.0
1	Yeah.	0.0
3	And I would go with the roaches. I mean the rat does sound easier to eat through quote with the roaches the organs and the organs are a lot smaller. You're not chewing through what you know, is that you know, yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah, that's true that is but that is a hard one to really go through. I was thinking cockroach at first but I mean, it's a whole bowl and I don't think I could eat a whole bowl of cockroaches. Let's just this really disgusting in general. Brother, who is this one cockroach. Maybe was The Whole Bowl.	-1.0
3	That's just like that's a no on me.	-1.0
1	Okay, go next one much less disgusting question.	-1.0
3	Would you rather marry and live with forever somebody that you hate that you like cannot stand right or be alone forever and live with your parents for your entire life.	-1.0
1	Okay. Well see this that's a if I live with my parents my entire life, but most likely be dead, you know, like before I die. So like technically would I die at the same time they die because if I'm going to be late my parents would have to either live until I die or I die when they die, you know what I mean? Patsy that's the type of thinking you have.	-1.0
3	Because that question alone your parents you you'll live a full life. So you let the 80 and your parents are like superhuman and live to like a hundred and twenty or a hundred and forty or house.	1.0
1	Yeah, that wouldn't work because I think I have to choose the first one. I have to probably I probably marry in love with someone I hate because you can still make that somehow work. I feel like because it me, you're still gonna hate them doesn't say how hard like how harsh you hate them.	-1.0
3	You know what I mean? Like well, yeah, it's like you can't hate them a little but but like yeah to go with you on that one too. I mean, there are plenty of marriages as we're tables hate each other and manage to make Yeah. Yeah, I think I'd want that but in this situation, I think it would do that because I mean like if you think about it, like if you if you live with your parents your whole life, you're not going to hit anyone like oh, that's the point. You're not supposed to throw this part of the second one, too. You'll be alone your whole life you like ever get a girlfriend or anything.	-1.0
1	You probably want the You probably would want the first one at least.	1.0
3	Yeah, I want them when I would rather like have someone to make new experiences with rather than have the same routine every day, you know, so yeah. Okay Ricky. What's our last the last question? Would you rather go one year without your phone or like months without seeing a single person?	-1.0
1	So one year without your phone for one month without seeing a	-1.0
3	Single person. Okay. So on my solitary confinement, but you have your phone now.	-1.0
1	Yeah, but okay, so no face. Yeah, I was going to say if you have your you can only tell ya that's gonna get boring if you will actually go insane. I don't think like I think I more likely would rather see people than have my phone on be honest with you.	-1.0
3	Yeah, I'm gonna go with Thomas on this one because you can still you can you can actually talk to people you can say that you don't even have a phone.	1.0
1	He's got a nice bod ounces. Yeah, it work.	1.0
3	I know man, I think I'd is the tough one, but I think I'd rather go the month and just get it over with.	1.0
1	Mmm, I got I mean at least you can you can text me back. Yeah, but but if you can't see people, I mean you can't have you can't have Instagram and stuff on your phone.	-1.0
3	That's true for Snapchat technically either. Yeah, that's probably what it be. Seeing many people.	1.0
1	Otherwise, that's anyway because I mean, well, it says it says you can't have it without my phone. This is you can have your phone doesn't say you can't have like a tablet or anything like that. True Tech didn't put the technically and you know, like you could tag technically have an iPod or a tablet or some type of the laptop that's kinda going through loophole on the questionnaire.	1.0
3	And I mean, it's not on the question that imported in so technically I mean not against the rule way to make me feel bad about not making my questions Pacific and North I'll do better next time. Don't worry.	1.0
1	Ricky to come out with would you rather and like it be something about dying this way and he like get really specific it would be like a four page essay on how like one thing and like or and it'll be like, okay. Ricky didn't have to be that specific. I know Thomas. I'm just making sure there's no loophole and this is all you hear is me get one local around like well you oh my god rather.	-1.0
3	by being strangled in your Will you buy a black albino midget died from autoerotic asphyxiation and have your parents be the ones to find you? I don't even know what that second one means bro. Well, I'm not really gonna explain it but it's basically hanging yourself accidentally while doing things.	-1.0
1	Let me just look that up real Thomas you get the real question so we could well I where did TV shows I'm going to take that off the list of things technically. You don't need it.	-1.0

Why can't we get like four people in the head with the ball and just be included in clip? I was twice we're playing our this encounter and then we hit you on the head and we hit you in the head on purpose. Anyway, huh. So we're doing all that right we don't get kicked out, but that my sister and my girlfriend are there with a story and walking so I behind them and I like jump up on them. And I don't do them. Like I dunk on them with a volleyball or something right like, you know being really obnoxious. It's and stupid. Nothing happens.	-1.0
1	They pick up the ball turn around in like lightly toss it back employee comes over get out of my store and kicks him out, but the funniest actually even funnier than that. So the same day all this happened basically on the same day the small stuff Ricky Caleb and Ryan they all went to go to a store and buy the new year ago. Name it so Rick. He's like yo, Dave and Thomas. Can you watch my sister and my girlfriend make sure that you know just get into trouble you in trouble. So we're sitting there me and Dave on our phones maybe about four or five minutes later. They start whispering to each other and they they just booked it. They're gone, right they're not running but they're like walking really fast the way I looked at Dave and I go Dave where we should we watch them and they was like, yeah, we're probably like me. It's okay. Ricky really get it tells you had to and I like and then I go actually maybe right let's go. So we started going like to follow them. We were like, okay, let's not get too close. Now, we're gonna hopefully Palms so I don't know if they want to follow them. But you know, Ricky told us watching so we're walking and we stopped for sometimes like we're stopping. We're like, okay, we're going to stop here watched you and they move and keep going and then at a point I go there they are. ER let's go there they're walking and the lady goes to us and she goes that's not funny. Don't do that. I was like, what are we doing?	-1.0
3	And like okay, I'm standing there looking at this lady.	0.0
1	Like what are you what what are you so a minute later like okay. I guess we'll go but then we're about to keep falling and then me and Dave go back to the lady and we have to explain why what we were doing because I think she thought we were going to like kidnap them.	-1.0
3	It was it was it was he told me that Like after he was talking to the lady like after we explained the we're walking away and I'm like, so what just happened because I'm still trying to confuse. He's like, oh the lady thought we were going to kidnap them and I was like, oh, well, yeah, that's definitely not what was happening is not going to wish that was there for that. But yeah, we we left the mall would go to a store down the street real quick.	-1.0
1	Yeah. Okay. So, um, I think that's enough for funny stories. We got pretty into that one.	1.0
3	I think we should move on to our what I want to make fun of something real quick. Okay. So in Boston, they approved that heterosexual afraid the straight Pride Parade, like look, I'm straight and without saying anything that would get anyone upset. I understand why you know gay people I sexual and all the LGBT community are so you know kind of I don't want to say in your face, but also they're in your face about it not I'm not saying that in a bad way or anything. I don't want it like offend anyone but you know, they struggled for their rights for a long time and they finally, you know fun. selves equals and so they got afraid, you know, cool. They got a month cool puts out. The straight people are like we wanna pray. Yeah, we straight people definitely need to make up for all the Discrimination we faced over the years.	1.0
1	Yeah, the other thing is you seen a gamer movement going around - they're doing really yellow for gaming but I think yeah because you know, I guess gamers are being discriminated discriminated against Idol. I don't know how that works. But yeah, so if you guys want to support the Gaming Community, you know, just change your profile picture to yellow and there you go. You're supporting The Gaming Community. Okay. So after we were going to go on to our next topic after their hetero parade and Go funny stories funny stop Thomas you want to talk about that Mouse thing because you know get a little bit of curious. Okay. So this is actually something that I just thought everyone should know if you haven't been keeping up with like science part of the news because I don't think that's I don't know if it's right up under shown on or anything like real news yet, but scientists have been working with a with a gene editing tool called. Crispr has nine and you can edit things and fix things and they were able to make they're able to do things and like they were able to basically cure HIV in most mice that had it because you know, they they got mice that had HIV and erotic. Okay. Now we're going to try to get basically get rid of so they use crisper and they're able to get rid of HIV so their plan now is to try it out on humans and see if that works and I mean I mean, that's one of the biggest steps.	1.0
3	I think that's got it ever got to be one of the biggest steps towards keyring a therapy.	1.0
1	Yeah, so I I know yeah, I know that we got from like a serious like a funny thing, but I just thought it'd be nice to talk about some interesting fact to know.	1.0
3	Yeah, so for any but I hope for the next few years. I mean I'd predict.	1.0
1	Five to ten years.	0.0
3	I have found a way to actually cure HIV and if we manage to do that, that'd be one of the biggest advancements in modern medicine.	1.0
1	I mean, it'd be almost as big as like curing cancer cure diabetes or any other like actually what they're doing with like Crispers they want to use it to cure cancer to so they've been working with that to cure like one cancer and stuff.	1.0
3	So yeah, there's that. I'm in you know, 20 years from now cancer. HIV diabetes all these other, you know polio all these other, you know genetic or sexually transmitted or You know any kind of disease like that 10 help me stop death sentence and even still today is almost a death sentence.	-1.0
1	I'm like getting a cold. Yeah, like whoops. I caught AIDS again. Let me take my S Family Guy would put a let me take my Nyquil cold flu and AIDS pill now, we have two topics on the board still to talk about what thing about talking about some sports and working about talking about climate change. I don't know if we'll get the climate change or get too much into it, but I'm really research too much on it right now so late. It's a serious affecting topic. I think what we're going to do for most of our podcast is we're going to start. With like what we want to talk about get like that. We'll probably move into some funny topics some little game show in the middle and then move into some serious topics at the end. I don't know and put in as though it's good to write.	-1.0
3	Yes that I want to run by you guys like right now on the podcast so that we can like us ask what like their opinion would be.	1.0
1	I like depends on whether It depends on where the watching these. It's going to be on like eight different platforms it automatically uploads to those so I can't tell you if I'll see all the comments. But if I happen to see some most of those comments then cool. If not, then sorry guys, but I didn't get to see your comments.	-1.0
3	But yeah, so so here's my idea is right. Okay, I love them through and entertainment like movies TV shows talk about what's going on in that range of things. Straight talking about like what movies are doing good movies aren't doing good that kind of thing. And then my second idea is music. Like the music realm I guess we could get into music to an extant has that is definitely the other things going on in the wrap in the rap culture right now, like not even just rap.	1.0
1	There's other thing. I know it sounds like I'm just saying yeah, we'll look into that one.	-1.0
3	For example, the grass is on top. Freaking little knives ex he's gay.	-1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
3	I saw that the other day crazy. I was like, oh my God as his horse isn't the only thing he's riding on an Old Country Road.	-1.0
1	I mean, I mean good for him. He has the courage to like come out about them.	1.0
3	So I I'm all for it. But I swear if he starts talking about right something else. I'm out. Yeah. No, I'm a very had the courage to come all I don't want to say anything that would offend anybody. But yeah, I mean good for him as long as he's happy that their else that's really old is I don't really care that he's gay like I like I don't really care. I don't really care like I'm still gonna listen to his music but like I'm saying if he starts rapping about like some fruity stuff like Yeah, that's gonna change his fan base is gonna look like very lot of like little 12 year old like little little like kids that listen to his music because their parents are not going to let them listen to that kind of stuff.	-1.0
1	I don't know. I feel like caring for more like the our society nowadays is not as strict as it used to be so I mean, I don't see not a strict but there's a lot more accountability.	-1.0
3	I mean it Oh, I thought it was cell phones now and it's everything has a lot more urgency to it.	-1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah, then sure.	1.0
3	Let's talk about that just happened today was Thomas York your quote that you live by not really a quote but somehow I mean we could we could do whatever we could.	1.0
