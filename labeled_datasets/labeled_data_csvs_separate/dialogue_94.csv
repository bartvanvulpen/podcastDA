2	Welcome to the wrong culture podcast. My name is Dane ver way. I'm an experienced Runner and running physiotherapist. I created this podcast not only so I had an excuse to talk running each and every week something that I love to do, but more importantly this podcast gives me the opportunity to interview fellow Runners friends and health professionals in a relaxed and easygoing format. This podcast is designed for the everyday Runner so we can all live learn. Grow and enjoy everything there is to running together. I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome back to episode 17 of the wrong culture podcast today. I interviewed a man Clark one of the athletes are coach from the Run culture hours. This is the third time I've caught up with Damien over the past six months. Although as you'll hear today's episode is a little bit different Damien's had a setback. He's recovering from an injury. He's had a month off running. Whereas over the past 2 episode Damien couldn't put a foot wrong. To in pee I have to pee. I love this podcast episode for a number of reasons one because I feel like a lot of people can learn from it anyone who's currently injured. I think we'll be able to learn and just sympathize with Damien over the past month and what he's going through. Damien also shows a fair bit of maturity in this episode. He's learned a lot since he had a major injury this time last year and he's definitely gone about this injury a whole heap better in terms of how he's viewed it and and Managed IT. He certainly has stopped listen to it and tried to get on top of it straight away. I also liked this episode because it shows that her load management isn't in tight tirely. The reason for this injury. So we've Damien. Yeah, he missed last season's track season and then we started introducing spikes so that it could do his 1500 and 5K races. And yeah, he's got saw in his foot because he started to use this. Spike's more but really the way that we introduced the spikes was very slow. And a lot of people would have been able to tolerate this load. So it shows that how how everyone's different and we learn from our experiences. So Damien and I will be better for this. We all know that okay, we have to ease our way forward and slowly build Damien's tolerance to track spikes and the speed work involved on the track. And this will come all right enough for me. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Okay, here we are again with Damian Clark and I will catch up.	1.0

2	Yeah. Yeah so good. You can just get to places now a bit more independently. Yeah, it's fantastic. And then so it's happened to also, you know from a running front and an injury front this time around and I think it's important to touch base and report on because like we said from the start we're going to report the ups and downs of It's not all smiles and Reva. Yeah, that's it. It's not all positives. But there certainly were still a few positives this this time around like like I said last time we're going to do a few fifteen hundreds and and you ended up doing a few in October had they go.	1.0
1	Yeah good finally cracked 4:30. Yeah just was like 429 six or something that he did it twice. I did it twice to it once a day and then the following Saturday around no 429 just that into	1.0

1	Yeah, just maybe Shield.	0.0
2	Yeah, how did those races feel good.	1.0
1	That's the first time I've ever really I can still wear my watch but I felt was unnecessary. Yeah, like I was I didn't check my watch at all like that all around it as a race and then I got good times out of it and still felt like looking back. I still feel like I got more to give and yeah, just enjoy the race. Yeah. Yeah, so take whatever.	1.0
2	Nana's is great. So you felt like you were getting some speed and we're certainly trying to do a few more speed sessions as well on the track. And then we got to the three 3 ke early November and this was sort of did you finish the exams what this stage?	1.0
1	That was the day of my last?	0.0
2	Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, finally pressure was off a little bit but must have been a bit of a surreal feeling doing that race. Ace after all the pressure you'd be putting on yourself a lot of emotions like that. Yeah would have been a funny day.	1.0
1	Yeah, and I'll light race to get look quite like wasn't it's like 9 o'clock start. Yeah, definitely very different to what I'm used to.	-1.0
2	Yeah. So this was the first mileage club and it was at Duncan McKinnon in Glen Huntley that morandini ass track. And yeah, I thought you look fantastic like you certainly piece together. A good sort of 1500 two k's in that race and and your Technique looked really good and you you certainly look like you had a new new few gears and then it just sort of got your late in the race.	1.0
1	Yeah, really set it off in this at the start. But yeah, I've known Carly say what happens at the end. Yeah, but again, I didn't check my watch for the whole race or just going off the splits and so still getting a lot better at running it as a race. Yeah, but yes, I'm just happened to that last Caleb. I lost it and get kind of fell apart towards the end.	-1.0
2	It's okay. Like that's that's running. I like it's very rare that you hit your first 3K of the season and nail it like it's often often takes a few goes and just it's a different type of writing, isn't it? Then cross country? Yeah, definitely, but if you learn yeah, yeah, but even just that pace, so what did you go through 1K in and what did you go through? A to KN. Can you can you remember what they call it out?	1.0
1	He was like 306 for the first K and then just over free 10 for the second K. Yeah, and then the last one I thought over 324 last time.	0.0
2	Yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah. Yes. I mean I still like brand under 10 minutes so may not take it.	1.0
2	Yeah, exactly and I mean conditions aside because it wasn't the best day.	-1.0
1	He is miserable with like Lane ones for	-1.0
2	what'd you hapless? Yeah, and I think many people had really good days time was that day? I don't think there was many PV so now but then after that, yeah, just the the sore foot over the weekend after that was kind of turn for the worst kind of Sunday.	-1.0
1	I'm a long runs and 60 minutes and felt this sharp pain at the fucking before foot. It didn't go away for Around yep, their messages are away and godly fear in the worst.	-1.0
2	Yeah, so we had a look at it. I'm sure the next day and it was like pretty sore close to the second metatarsal. So I was like or yeah, but this could just because you're using Sparks more and doing a bit more speed, but we'll just be honest the quarter side and cross train for the week and try to calm it down with some ice and some some anti-inflammatories and And then we looked at it another week later and I still was no greater Yeah, we actually had to pull out of the 5K chance that way because well second time here at he's like second year running.	-1.0
1	Yeah II II II you're not running.	0.0
2	Yeah. So that's the aim for 2020 is to get to that Vic 5K Champs and and actually start the race.	1.0
1	Yeah, so had the week off cross-training and spin bike.	1.0
2	And then try to get the next Monday for 20 minutes and that was not pretty yeah, and so like we said, okay well and then I really assess it and it was sore still in that same area and and knowing that you came off a stress fracture last year. We treated it as more a bony injury. So so we ended up deciding to have we didn't get a scan but we've had Three weeks off running and then we're just gradually trying to introduce a little bit of running now to see how it is. So hoping that is just an early stage bone reaction and and then you can slowly get back into running bit legit like we laugh about it now, but that was quite a frustrating time for you like missing that 5K because luckily sort of reported in one of those earlier podcast like we've had some Ames with your 5K and on the track. It's a really good environment. I meant to do a good 5K time. So it was quite frustrating but I thought like you're dealt with it. Well, how did you feel like you handled it?	-1.0
1	Yeah, it's best I could yes are they kind of just go switch in once it comes with straps yourself? Yep. Take it forward. It is like there's not much I can do about it now and I've liked it. He said coming off an injury last year where I ran through the injury and just made it so much worse. I mean he had to take months off. Mr. Rice, then miss a number five.	-1.0
2	Yeah, and I think that's like so much you were like a such a great mindset because yeah, you met Miss three weeks and running but you don't miss you know, four months of running consistently. So your Fitness, you know dropped a little bit but not like it would if you miss four months, so yeah, so you like that's so good luck to you all. Learning from one of your first major injuries and and I feel like the way you've gone about this one has been really good and so far we couldn't have done any better in terms of settling it down because as soon as you got saw you responded we looked at it and we've gone about trying to settle it down like which is yeah. I mean, it's fantastic like I would recommend that to anyone back home like if you've got got An injury respond respond to it straight away. But at the same time how do you know what's an injury like often? We've all got Nichols as Runners and if we get to to responsive to niggles, then we wouldn't run. Yeah. So how did you know that it just you couldn't run it's a different kind of pain.	1.0
1	It's like it was so localized. It was just sharp. Yeah, and it was it was hurting to run. Yeah. It wasn't just like a knee. Because you push through is yeah and you came in here and you couldn't hop could you know, like just simple stuff like everyday stuff that yes.	-1.0
2	Yes interfering with exactly and that that that's a really good point. I mean like stuff interfering with your daily life. You were limping a little bit.	1.0
1	Oh, it sounds limping but it would mean like I could really like take sharp turns and like yeah, like if I had 200 black really over rotate my foot it would yeah, it wouldn't be right.	-1.0
2	Yeah, and yeah see you put on these big white Nike shoes for your couple of weeks. Yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah, they had a bit of cushion prove it of support under the foot.	1.0
2	Yeah. Yeah, it's great. And so earlier this week we assess it again and we assess it last week last week. We said you were ready this week. We got on the treadmill and you are able to do five. I mean it's end and after hopping on it and pushing it it passed. So now I've decided to start running.	1.0
1	What have you done so far so laughter and some initial tests last week, which was good.	1.0
2	But not yeah, it was pretty close, but it's still just wasn't like there. Was that stiff feeling there?	-1.0
1	Yeah, it's I'll go couldn't give a full conference last week. But so took the weekend off and then you have a 5 meter run and then that looks pretty good pretty promising. So then yesterday I did another 10 minutes add another 5 minutes. And again, it's feeling pretty promising. I'm pretty confident. Yes, no real issues as of yet.	1.0
2	Yeah. So we've sort of set you up with a really slow Progressive run return to run program over the next day, you know ten days or so and we'll just see we'll just be really responsive each day. Tell how it seems to react I think you sort of at the stage where it was a hot spot. Like it's really calm down and a little bit of running were actually be good for it. But just a little bit.	1.0
1	Yeah every I don't know five minutes each day.	0.0
2	Yeah, exactly. So now like readjusting and re-evaluating sort of where you're at. What are the goals?	1.0
1	Let's assume we're still looking at that 5K still seeing how close I can get to a national school fire by the end of the season. Yep.	1.0
2	Like tent that's 1545.	1.0
1	Yeah snow really set selection criterias and released yet. But I'm 1540 of English we say yeah. They have like it's only December. I've got until like march/april Stewart heaps of time. Yeah, see I am for that 5K still really can on I've had to pull out of 10 K last night as well. So it's a really keen on that's right.	1.0
2	That was Abby's out of that effect.	-1.0
1	Yeah, and I would have been in the div 1 here. Yep. Yeah, so I was coming it's kind of frustrating but I definitely like to have another crack because we see the results for that. However long Look for California.	-1.0
2	Yeah, you haven't seen them either. I know Michael conahan and Dion finocchiaro. We're running it.	0.0
1	Yeah. See, I definitely like to have another crack later in the season if possible. Yeah, that's my goal is to see it for the tracks easy. Yeah, maybe you know freak A 4 comes up.	1.0
2	But yeah, I think that's the idea for my track cool and then obviously it's going to be a bit of a I mean you just have to wait and see like how your marks going next week and then and then he's at January where you decide like what's happening next year in terms of uni, or whoever some so I get results next Thursday, and it was like a change of preference period	1.0
1	I can re-evaluate where I want to go and change your preferences for mean he's what dates that so the first round offers coming up the following Wednesday the 18th. So I could I could know where I'm going two weeks. Okay, if I get enough of them and there's some office it come out in January. Yeah, I think I should definitely know by January. Yeah what I'm doing the life.	0.0

Yeah, and then what have you got planned because like this is probably some of the best best years of your life really like where you have these massive summer holidays where you finish finish in November and then don't start again until Feb March. What else have you got planned? You obviously got the Phillip Island trip. You got anything planned over Christmas or January?	1.0
