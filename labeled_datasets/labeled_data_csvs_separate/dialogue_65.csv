Well, neither did I and out of 1,000 young men on that ship one man. William Randall was the only Survivor they told his family. She was sunk in a battle. But Randall says he knows what he saw and in his words. It had no conscience. No reasoning just destroy and he spent the last 30 years trying to prove the truth of what he learned. Day and what he learned is what you guys are about to learn Guyz this planet doesn't belong to us ancient species only this Earth long before Mankind and if we keep our heads buried in the sand any longer, they will take it back. There's this agency which goes by the name of Monarch in a specializes in the hunt for massive unidentified terrestrial organisms. And today it is a today's episode is on just one of them the skull crawler. The information I got is from the King Kong Wiki and from the Monarch files. Here we go. Little is known about the origins of this voracious Predator. Although its evolutionary purpose is it is abundantly clear the skull crawler exists to devour destroy and dominate Subterranean a nature and burrowing up through through the geologically unstable. Steve leant across Skull Island. It is as though the skull crawler climbed up out of hell itself, and this terrifying Serpentine animal is a hyper for a creature with such a hyper a generalized metabolism that it exists in And of course instead of starvation and just as a shark must keep swimming to survive the the skull crawler must keep feeding dislocate dislocating its own jawbone's so to maximize its ability to swallow anything that crosses its path and within that gaping cavernous small exists along Whiplash tongue in which the creature uses to ensnare and constrict its prey.	0.0

And as too dark and lifeless eye sockets regard their prey with cold unflinching malice and the powdered of its facial features, maybe maybe maybe indicative or indicate of of bluffing Behavior. It designed to threaten and terrify its prey and Monarch has observed different skull crawlers in a variety of Different sizes and he give it the unreachable depths of their Subterranean. Nesting grounds scientists have no way of knowing how big these things really get or the pecking order that governs their trouble feeding patterns the more they learn about the cultural history of Skull Island from the agenda from the indigenous petroglyphs. They have discovered the clearer it becomes that the evolution of the skull collars has long been into woven with Cog and his Fallen ancestors if Kong is a god of sky island then Here Comes The Devil	1.0
2	Evil skull crawlers are large reptilian creatures with only two long forelimbs and no hind limbs as well as long prehensile Serpentine snake-like Tails. They have long and slender. He had muscular sturdy bodies and several aspects of their appearances are noticeably skeletal particularly with their torsos in their heads and what and what appeared to be the eye sockets of the skull like heads are actually merely empty fenestrae presumably that it evolved that way in order to	0.0

There has closely resembles those of mosasaurs such as Tylosaurus and their jaws and the Jaws possesses two rows of serrated razor-sharp teeth and the skull colors have four digits and total of each of each hand with the thumb being the smallest digit and the rest of the dudes being larger. and of the same size and the adults have a prominent bony Spike have a prominent bony Spike that protrudes out of each of their elbows and the thorny tooth like structures other inner mouth somewhat resembled that of those of a leatherback turtle and additionally they they have long triple forked tongues that they could use to grab their prey with smaller skull crawlers are easily are easily distinguishable for the larger ones because their heads are smaller and more sloped and they also possess a more probability brown skin tone larger skull crawlers are almost as big as Kong and their heads are more defined and somewhat angled and their tails are also armed by some form of club that could be used as a weapon and also have boats bikes protruding from their elbows like I said before, The skull crawlers were designed to act as the Fallen Angels of cogs Kagan and represent the darker Bleaker aspects of Skull Island. The voice of the skull crawler is very high in tone. It's possessing a raspy quality of the hiss and growl mixed in between according to supervisor sound a sound designer and editor Al Nelson. The skull crawlers voice was inspired by the painful bye-bye the painful squeal of a Dying rabbit. And also the and sounds of sea lions and squirrels are mixed together. And this is what is the sound that they commonly make? And one of its vocalizations work we cycled from the indominus Rex from Jurassic World. And unless it's called crawlers appear to be naturally Fearless as two of them teamed up to attack Kong despite being smaller and outmuscled. The largest of the skull crawlers which by some has been given the nickname scold devil appear to be more intelligent than the rest of his kind and this was seen it when he appeared only ones called was subdued by Preston Packard and we'll what it felt like and what it felt like Earl Cole was tricking it. It also has to has to also seems to have a hint of sad ISM or sadism as as it licked columns face maliciously after he'd been Tangled Up and of shipwrecks Rudder chain, this large skull crawler was also shown to have deep desire. Killing and eating humans and that was shown several times when he diverted his attention from Kong to Jan's comrade at Mason Weaver implying that he opted that that he acts not only from Primal Instinct, but from over some degree of malice and cruelty.	0.0
2	This could also hit that the skull crawlers are are unbelievably malevolent as take Marlo calls some nasty and mean as hell as the apex predators of Skull Island Skull crawlers are fearsome and deadly in battle. Usually their Jaws full of razor sharp. Teeth is the primary weapons and they hold their own against opponents such as Kong as they're able to withstand the blows and public of the ape and then the serpent like tails are used for swatting or for wrapping around an opponent during combat.	1.0
3	And the tail is heavily muscled and extremely powerful and that's shown with the office the the alpha skulk are lifted and flung Kong like a football across the lake with his tail and as stated before that the tail is also for wrapping around large prey possibly to latch onto them for balance or to constrict them. And it's called crawlers are Subterranean Predators with insatiable appetites that are that are the result of their height and metabolisms. They are both solitary and pack Hunters one can kill a big buffalo on its own and they can cooperate to take down more powerful creatures such as calm and being some training and nature skull crawlers are capable of using their limbs to burrow deep into the Earth and they seem to have mostly mostly a primal mindset and they are highly aggressive so practically hostile As well as incredibly persistent in pursuing their prey. They do have however show some degree of intelligence shown when the skull devil the largest of the skull crawlers with refuses to devour somebody armed With Grenades and simply swats a person away school colors are very are very durable as they can withstand bullets from rifles and even the Searing heat from a flamethrower and the alpha skull crawler was only dazed when calling slammed his head with a boulder or smashed his face with a tree branch and they have incredible. More stamina because they're able to stay in a full-fledged fight for several minutes. Even while being incredibly injured and the skull crawler appear to be actually more intelligent than the others and this was seen and this received because he appeared only ones calling was subdued and it all and and its colors possess possess accelerated metabolism, which causes them to live in constant constant starvation, and this is shown when the skull devil ravenously tried to eat neither and refuse to let go of Congress arm and calm down turned his appetite. Against it did tearing out its tongue and other internal organs and had it often and had it let go it would have in fact survive as Congress holding Weaver and adults colors tongue. Now, I'm going to say to say what their role was in the film. It's called crawler was stirred. It was first seen feasting on on a dead squirrel Buffalo by Kong and called was about to confront the creature when he was ambushed by a second skull crawler after a lengthy battle called it Kong ends up subduing and killing both skull crawlers by Smashing one skull with a devastating Stomp and the other by stuffing its head into the ground breaking its neck. And another skull crawler ambushed Jack Chapman and a Spore mantis, but I went for Chapman and ate him alive while the sport management mantis managed to escape and that same and that very same skull crawler. Then showed up in the Boneyard and regurgitated Chapman's remains and this was actually normal behavior because the because the skull crawler wasn't being sick. It was just getting rid of the indigestible stuff and when William Randa attempted to make his camera work, he was devoured by it and he then it and then tried to attack the	-1.0

And the skull crawler then set its eyes on Conrad and and reg slivko, but we were rescued them by tossing a lighter. I one of the Subterranean events creating an explosion that killed the skull color immediately. Then then the giant skull crawler which given the nickname scold devil was waked due to seismic explosive dropped on the Skull Island along with the rest of his kind after calling was incapacitated by Packard. It's called out the skull devil left. His presence be known by emerging. From the bed to the water thus and that began a three part about it what's called? I will have the upper hand on confidentially. And as he changed and as he chased James Conrad and the other survivors of the research that I've mentioned said to Skull Island Earl Cole tried to sacrifice himself by arming several grenades before having the massive creature tried to eat him to both creature up. However, it's called Apple didn't fall for this and he batted up against the cliff as a grenade went off killing him as the skull devil. Finally reached the rest of the crew calling appear to just in time to start with a large Boulder as the crew ran to safety and then the and then thus called overturns. Devil turned his focused to Kong counting on him and gripping his throat with his Jaws called in the skull devil could take them to brutally wrestle puddle and bite each other until the skull down Force Conga to a shipwreck with a blow from his tail where what he had came became entangled to the chains. I think that's a reference to the to of on King Kong film. And with conch subdued in the wreck, the massive skull down will return his Focus to the humans. And as he approached the crew once more the skull Devil's right.	-1.0

He was also fired upon By Conrad and his companions and that allowed called to gain an advantage and that allowed Kong to get an advantage of the fight before finally upper Cunningham was the ship's propeller slicing his throat open and seemingly killing him and and and as we ever will and after Weaver was knocked into the water earlier in the fight combat is to save her from drowning, but unfortunately, the giant skull called was still alive and he pounced Called once more after quality his tail around Prague. He wrapped his tongue around the HR and pulling it down his gullet and an attempt to devour Weaver, but after a brief struggle called tour the creatures tongue where which is connected to its internal organs out of his mouth killing him instantly avenging the deaths of his parents and that stated I personally imagine calling saying this like a she's ripping it out. I imagine him saying this is for Mommy and Daddy and the end that they are	-1.0
2	Goodbye, the native so much and their food by the natives to the point where they don't wear their won't mention their true name. And and this makes the name skull crawler a nickname as Marlo as I take Marlo admitted. He just made up a name to make them sound scarier. But the true name is Cranium rep tent and the the skull crawlers are similar in appearance to the mud demons from the third Chronicles of Riddick movie and they are known to be responsible for killing Kong's parents and wiping out a species leaving.	-1.0
3	to be the last of his kind and this is seen and in the comic book known as Skull Island berth of column and mentioned by Hank Marlowe and remains of advantage of the deceased parents are called receipt of the skull crawlers territory of the movie and given that there are no dinosaurs in the movie and that the remains are President Scholars territory is possible that dinosaurs Old Scotland if they were once present there may have been wiped out by the skull crawlers or or something else that some unknown event prior to the film and During the production of the film The reason why there were no dinosaurs in the movie besides Triceratops skull was because it was because Jordan Valle de vocht Roberts thought that Jurassic world was still fresh in everyone's mind and praises and Praises Peter Jackson for for doing a decent job for making King Kong fight of earwax and in 2005 version, so he did it. So he tried to make up completely such make them look completely made-up creatures in the film, but the but the but the skull cause I got a pretty good crawling Bo It's like they reach their it's like they reach their arms around and they step they can also fall over pretty easily.
