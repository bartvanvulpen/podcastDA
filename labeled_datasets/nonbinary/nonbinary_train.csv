Three people who made serious mistakes sir.

So, you know, what you worried at all after you know, Jewish. I don't even know if they said because you were so young. If this evening entered your mind said that were you concerned that you might get Typecast because as you mentioned if you think about juice in the context of everything else being made at that point, I mean, this is 1992, right? So you got boys in the hood you got mrs. Society, so discussing black trauma and putting black trauma on That way was a big thing. It became a cottage industry where you ever concerned that this is this is who are all of who Hollywood is just going to see you as no, I was never concerned about that because probably to your point because I was too young too, but I was never concerned about it.	1.0
And that is of course that creates a big problem not for the people who are working close to the printing press so people working on financial markets people working in the government and so on but it's a problem for the economy as a whole especially for the weaker parts of the economy, right Working Class People people jobs very much removed from financial markets from the banking industry and so on and we should expect their you should be to observe not in pain. Parchment then indeed.	-1.0
So it was so destroyed. It was just like link like we don't like like Three like I don't care about link like I don't you skipped a generation. But yeah, that's one joint where I was just and I have a good feeling about you.	-1.0

So Mondays are day to recover and I kind of lost a lot of time today just due to an incident that happened when I locked my keys in Car even though I have keyless entry. There's a low battery and I locked them in. So anyway couldn't get the car open and I had to use my roadside assistance.	1.0

Alright, so we are on the draft network. Of course, you can listen to yesterday's podcast with Joel Marino from the draft Network and we're going to use their predictive board go through four rounds and will be manually picking each Packer pick at 12:30 and the to for second and third as well. So as things go along I am solely scrolling through right now. And the big thing right now is Kyla Marie didn't go number one. and so with our pick We do have Brian Burns out there. Both Iowa tight ends out there DK Metcalf is the currently the highest rated player out there for this one as long with along with Devin Bush.	1.0
Did he ever give you an explanation why he was wired that way to be just in and out of his kid's life or specifically in and out of your life.	-1.0
Yeah, she has Jazz this week and so far. She's been killing. I mean they've only had today I think they started today because it's like we're I think we're going to Disneyland tomorrow.	1.0
Like I think there's was the most creative. I like I said, this is right up their alley. They were able to shine.	1.0
But yeah, I've just been very rare very yeah, he's very rare thing when you can't blame those teams picked used to kick rather than swap sighs, you know, so yeah, I think today was will struggle to live with Sheffield, you know is energy levels. They were they were every second ball. They will get it and perhaps they are the a little bit hungover from first the people say the professional athletes playing two games in a week. She'll be an excuse. It's not an excuse to you come up against professional athletes or implied. At all in the way. Yeah, so there is going to be he's a difference there. But I thought Jeff Ward United in terms of how they play with pretty poor. It was direct. He's running the channels. It was it was crap football, but it's so effective not the only game where you look alike. They goal kicks. They push everyone up they make the volcano literally all the players were probably 10 10 meter radius of each other because they know they're going to win that second ball and I can get more they so much the second door.	-1.0
Anyway, I think that Danka he's pretty much saved us about doesn't he like they slide in has been unreal. I was really worried and we know we can play there. But yeah, I'm real seis on the left. I think when Polly comes back I don't be harsh and then dunker I would just slap body back and on the right. So he's remembering its besiktas away using real that game. So you have to fair play to Dent Anka. I mean like I say he saved us because I was really worried when body got injured, but the way he slaughtered in has been incredible. I think I'll come over for said it last time but but I think we look better going forward with those to the back because they bring the ball in to Midfield don't like a bit more fluid than previously we retain possession a lot better as well so far.	-1.0
Men, yeah, thanks to the rooster crows cover. That was so with the boosters Rose.	1.0
Thank you. We're having a lot of fun. And again, it's it's nice to have like that appreciation, you know, because sometimes you do do a job and it's kind of like right next, you know, so and here people appreciate what you do no matter who you are. So we're just so blessed to be on the show. Honestly. It's been nothing but an amazing journey so far.	1.0
Yeah, there's this Christian who I actually really like I mean, I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I really like him and his name is Sean McDowell and he gave like this really cool talk where he pretended to be an atheist at a Christian college and he put on his atheist glasses me like talk to them as if he was an atheist giving all of like, you know, the atheist answer. is I guess and for the most part I thought he did a pretty good job, but then he kind of like took his glasses off and was like, like how do you guys think you did and it was just it was like how did you feel when you were being like questioned by me and like you weren't really winning the argument so to say like and they were like like I was mean to you like I was aggressive and I was defensive and you know, I felt attacked and I just wanted to prove you wrong so bad. Like I wasn't being loving through that and he his point was basically like Christians shouldn't be scared of Doubt because they should be a Christian because they believe that it is true. And if it after all of the research that you do if you come to the conclusion that you don't think it's true. Then you shouldn't be a Christian and he said that's okay you like you have to not be afraid of just pouring all the facts. Out there and and being true to yourself in that and of course he wants everyone to be saved but like no, that's really beautiful.	1.0
I almost feel like they were quieter. Like I don't commend ourselves. They were more I think hesitant to say anything like they said things obviously, but they were so quiet. Down by the fact that the show talked about steric the actors talked about steric. We talked about steric. They were kind of off like they didn't have any sort of voice to that. They would come up occasionally and like different things and like complain but I feel like the required or back then they got louder sort of as the show started turning against Eric.	0.0
Well, I wonder who'd Gadget person but I don't think I could run without of what should I do like to see See how far I've gone. But yeah, I definitely I just enjoyed the process.

John Singleton, John is He was he was super intense. Good good dude fun, you know, but he was really meticulous. That's the one thing. I remember about John like everything had a purpose every single thing on the set. The way the setting was everything had a purpose for him because he was into the he was like a genius Storyteller. So it wasn't just the words coming out of your mouth is what you have on is what's the picture on the wall? wall behind you when you're saying this line and and it was um, it was an intense set and it's really interesting how that was another set where we you can you can this certain projects with it feels bigger than the parts like we're saying something profound here this thing and you could feel that permeating through this set, you know Cube doing his thing and and Jennifer Connelly doing her three Kristy Swanson, but You never know like you look back on high alert and now and it's like sighs like prophetic, you know, you can't really know that in the moment, but I just think you know, that's a testament to his storytelling and you know, he picked he was talking about Universal things and and Timeless things that are unique to the American Experience.	1.0

Aren't you master next RZ masks RZ masks? We bought four of them for the Department. We bought the EM ones with the F3 filters which are the carbon filters. They're really really great for mapa. Again. We were talking about him earlier tonight for medical calls. They're great for if you're on the if you're the pump operator is well and you're just getting kind of a little bit of excess smoke coming out. Its they're good for there.

So even in the winter, I will go down to just like a cami which is if I don't know people in other countries listening I've realized that there are some new stats available to me. So I realized that only 79 percent of you are in the United States. So some of the terminology with our English could be a little bit different when I just throw out these random terms like I'm wearing a cami but it's a tank top a little spaghetti straps and it's something that I use. As an undershirt when I was out grocery shopping earlier. I had a t-shirt over it like if I'm wearing kind of a low-cut top. I like to wear a cami under it to kind of give me a little bit more coverage in the front but around the house once I start cleaning, I definitely go down to the Kami because I tend to get hot and I guess I'm just not like everybody else. I remember shopping with my mom recently. And she doesn't live near me but when I was in town visiting and she was saying something about well, it's not really the time of year to be buying short sleeve shirts or something.

No, so I know not the only one but Sis got a drinking ticket in high school. You did what I told you this. I don't think so. Yeah, I did there was like a couple people at my school that did and of course I was one of them like are you surprised? Are you I mean, no, so I was at this kids graduation party. I was like a junior. This kid was a senior. He had like a big party for his graduation and everyone was drinking. I wasn't the only one and a lot of I a lot of Vermont parties. I remember being in high school and cops coming to all of our parties. Is that just like a Vermont thing or did that happen to you too? It happened in college, but This happened in high school for us like in the middle of the woods in high school. Like I can only think of one time cops came and I'm trying to think of like what I did like it wasn't it wasn't anything that like wasn't handled like we were outside and they basically were like stop drinking like we have a ghoul can annoy. It was like a noise complaint like a neighbor called and said it was too loud. But like they never checked if anybody was drinking know there was like multiple parties. I got breathalyzed at in high school. Seriously. Yeah, that did not happen to me. I know that was like a thing and people like me that's why I like Hitler. It sounds bad that like not a drinking ticket underage. Whatever whatever but like it was so common. Like it happened to like a handful of people. I know not everybody but I happen to be one of them are just special. I am special help. So how I got the drinking ticket it was A friend's graduation party, he was a senior and he you know graduating high school. He had a big party a bunch of people from different ages went like this is like a pretty big. I remember it being a lot of people there and the cops show up and everybody like this is such a typical like Vermont thing. I know you all can relate like we just like all run in the woods like this was like the thing for Grant away. Oh my God, this was like a thing. Like we all just ran like ran into the woods. We slept into the abyss like and I was just like following somebody but like sis was so drunk. She couldn't like keep up solo me and like my like, I don't even know I was like trying to keep up like trying to hang beer in my hands like running. I'm wrong. I was like I got this I was like I got this And then of course, of course it was like I can't remember who I was with. I think I was like with some guy but we got caught and the cop was like come this way with me and you know, I was always taught that if a cop, you know catches you running you, don't try to fight it you just go along you go with him you apologize and that's what I did. So we went with him was like a group of like five kids and like we were the only girl So yeah, Jesus.	-1.0

Well, I think you see it in the case of Greece right when the socialist government came to power the wake of 2009 to to positive the 10 2010 to the left actually, so they got elected because they promised to get wreath out of the Eurozone. Yeah, okay, and they did this they got elected but they didn't take grease all over Europe politicians lying. Well surprise surprise, but I think they were honest when they were running to be elected and then actually they did a lot of learning and they Folly considered what their options were. And the truth is grease dropping out of the Eurozone would have suffered an enormous door back in really comes. Okay, this is this is there's no comparison. I don't say it wouldn't have been good for the country at the long run. Yes. I do believe it would have been good for the country in the long run. Especially if you're no longer on the monetary Lifeline right on the heart-lung machine then well, actually your own economy starts developing organic. Actually production becomes more important than just spending spending money, especially spending other people's money. So that's certainly a good thing but that they would not have survived this politically and actually most of the voters probably would not have liked it. Anyway speaking of Greece right Aristotle once said that actually most people were born to be slave simply people actually most people they they they they don't mind but other people are telling them what they should do and how they should So on as long as they have a nice cozy house and a car and they have enough to eat and saw that they had basically these Aristotle it said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Yeah. Well, I mean for him. Yes, of course that that was the only life worthy of man. Yeah, and as as a rational being so what is our objective as a rational being its he would say well to contemplate those things that they are terminal. But that is not the opinion of most people so I think coming back on the Eurozone their fight. I think even though the problems are greater than the periphery. The cost of moving away from the Eurozone are also greatest in the periphery Germany could remodel The Zone it would be hard but Germany would get along I think actually would be a great relief for Germany because right now contrary to what politicians in Germany always profess maybe that Germany's greatest beneficiary of the Eurozone. I think we actually the guys are funding this writing in real terms because all we what we exporting are real goods and services and what we are getting Hey, what's up promises?	-1.0

Yeah, I think I got just under 12 hours. I think it was 11 hours 38 minutes.

It says closed last year. I didn't realize it at the time but I actually had infected corneas and I ended up spending more in hospital. I had to go to him. DCI. Yes. It was the most the most painful thing. I've experienced besides childbirth. Yeah, so to go back and get under 12 hours was pretty cool. Yeah, it's amazing. How did he get infected corny is no idea. I don't know how I got infected couriers. I knew something was wrong. I thought it was. It was conjunctivitis, but then it became apparent that it was worse than that and I really didn't start but then I thought well if I could just make it to checkpoint to its DNS is better than a DNS and then at the checkpoint to my there's a few drawings. It was a long day. That is a huge blur in my mind. I don't remember it very well because I could barely see but one thing and I was it a lot of paid and apparently the weather was terrible, but that just didn't register with me at all because I had other things on my mind, you know, wow finished.

Yeah, they make sense for the Angels. Love that pairing makes as much sense for the Indians. I think the Angels would probably have to overpay just based on. Their system. It's such a weird. It's a weird thing anyway, because as we've talked about so many times like Obviously kluber does not have Peak trade value right now, you know, you're better off waiting six months or taking a time machine to go back a year or a year and a half. So you're asking a team to take on the contract and I know we've said like the contract is fine. As long as he turns out to be even an adequate picture but no one knows what he's going to be and so it's like you somehow still have to convince a team to give you a really useful piece. Otherwise, it makes more sense to just hold them. And the angels are weird team because they're so top-heavy and their farm system is a lot better than it was a few years ago. When it looks like Mike Trout was just gonna waste away like Tom Hanks in Castaway with Albert Pujols as Wilson, but it's I just made a movie reference like we hate document this podcast, but I think my name is void dumbass. That's that's a good reference. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what they eventually do with him because Because I think it's it's difficult to find if you're going to trade him. Now, then you some team is has to get desperate and I almost think the opposite of the Clevenger thing think of me more sense if the Dodgers liked kluber and believed in him just param with Linda or and see if that'll make a difference.	1.0

I've admired for a while and you know people who I get the sense even though Omar you and I don't know each other that well, but you know, I fuck with you, right?

Wow. I know what a what an opener. Yeah, like real Graces of me to like bring up something. I'm sure right now for Cowboys versus everybody is a sore subject. So where do you stand on Jason Garrett? Because a lot of is to some degree typical after a loss that people immediately direct all their anger and frustration at the coach.

Yeah, and I was just going to input that there were a lot of leadership changes during that time. But again, we don't know who influenced what and ultimately because Jeff was gone for a minute and I'm pretty sure Jeff was fired for a minute and but it was right at the same time as a like. The crossover where the change in leadership because LJ is Lindsay Jewett Sturman. She was in charge of season 5 for the most part. She took Jeff's notes and then really kind of cobbled that together and then they announced that season six was Jeff's last they got Hall age, which I'm like y'all paid out the but for this and then you know Season 6, so I'm like this wasn't a someone was doing him a favor.

It was too late and I didn't dealing with this situation and it's very sad man. Very very sad, but Again, we'll keep you up to date on this kind of situation is not looking good for him though.

Now I have one other thing. I don't know if this is about intuitive eating but this is just about me and I look at it behaviourally in terms of response effort, which response effort is. Exactly what it sounds like your response takes a lot of effort. So like you would always amazed me when we lived together. Like you'd be like filtering your own water system making your own milk to put on top of your like veggie. You're like oats in the morning or like your Chia what puddings I don't even know and I'm like this chick is so not lazy. Like it amazes me is like so like I what do you recommend? Doing because I find a problem also. Why okay, this is I know this isn't maybe not intuitive. I like why it's easier to eat unhealthy for example, or like maybe you're not even listening to yourself intuitively because you're honestly doing what is easier at the moment and like the easy options are like have you ever gone on a road trip and like tried eating healthy along the way it's really like it's like, oh my God, I'm gonna try be healthy. I'm gonna get Plain potato chips right like or I'm gonna get this bar that is essentially filled with so much crap or whatever it is because it's a matter of response effort to like you. I remember actually you want a way with people some words like some music festival or something. We're in Austin and like you packed all this food and like that seems like so much effort to me that I feel like it also does make like I don't know if I'm not necessarily listening to my Intuition or I'm just like doing what's easier.	0.0

He will both just Bonk each other and fall to your death. Really? Yeah. That's awesome. I hopped on the zipline and I'm heading over there and this guy like had a gun. I didn't have a gun. I was just going to go over there and just Punch right died but he and I didn't know why I didn't shoot. He just hopped on the zipline and came straight at me and we both like a bumped into each other and fell to her death. So maybe I got the kill so I was kind of happy with that right you like I'll take it.	1.0

He is the Beast somebody and I think that that's why because ultimately I think one of the reasons especially what what do we want to call them Timmy Mick em. He I think one of the reasons he was petty is because we didn't see Whatever. He was told the big picture was he couldn't show us the big picture and so all he saw was us being very upset and rightfully, so but instead of being like Oh, no, you're rightfully upset is just like will screw it. You know, you guys don't know what you're talking about and it's like yeah, we don't know and that's the problem is that we're reacting to this nonsense that you guys are throwing at us. I remember when we interviewed Chantal love her love her love her, but we are you know, Did you ever talk about steric onset? And she was like no, nope. Nope, never know and it was just like and then we asked her like who do you ship and she's like, oh, yes, Derek and never talked about it. All right, never ever ever never on set. You know, and I was like, I don't they're still a timeline of leadership that I'm very interested in it and that show because I was I was contacted which was interesting. Maybe because it was late. It was like 2015 but it was by a lawyer who used to work on the show. And so, you know just got some general Dietz that way because you know, he didn't have anything new of course, but the idea that yeah, there were these malls and you could see it sometimes in the writing but the problem was in trying to help us they ended up mucking up the cannon and mucking up the it even more because it's like I would kind of rather just have it Crash and Burn and just be mad at it than having these little things pop up or like oh wait, is that something and it's not them it wasn't them trying to give us hope but it was more like we see you.	-1.0
It's like I'm basically it had like all the opening season intro for exactly legend of the bit disappointed. I don't think some of my friends have had a chance to listen to all the audios. I think they'll be up in arms about it. Did they realize that they're just variants of the same same thing?	-1.0
Okay, so we covered two things in the meta first was that there was a lot of guard plane and a lot of the really successful competitors were guard players, but they were many successful top players to I don't mean to exclude them second as far as positions that we saw a lot of we saw a lot of half guard and Butterfly guard particularly from like lockers I should mention I didn't plan to mention this but we did see tons of inversions all weekend long. And what was interesting about the inversions and tells you that it's very clearly a part of the meta was that different styles of jujitsu were doing inversion. So we saw a Geo Martinez the 10th plant style both him and Elvira and Thor were all doing in versions. But then we also saw of course Paulo me out doing invert attacks. I think we saw Kennedy doing invert inversion attacks and some of the female competitors were I'm them too. And they all had kind of different purposes for doing them. Who was the guy that beat a Luca slippery. I have to check because I'm going to be people are gonna be mad if I forget his name, okay, it was Dante Leone. He maybe had the upset of the tournament. He beat Luca slippery and he did it with inversions. But his were more sort of traditional backed a conversions and I think he took Luke. He definitely took Lucas's back once he might have taken it twice, but he just had some bro. Inversions that he was working in a couple of his matches. So what that tells you is that inversions are useful for different competitors with different sort of game plans and strengths and weaknesses. So it's something to look into if you're playing more of an open guard game particularly. If you're like Locker another Trend that I noticed this weekend was how important the back attack was and what I notice in this is again something that as I was watching it. I kind of like asteroid like hey, are you seeing this a lot? Lot the last couple days, which is that competitors were really not interested in being in the mounts and they were very not interested in being in side control. I really shallow side control for more than a couple seconds 80cc. You didn't see a whole lot of guys working attacks from the mount everyone wanted the back to the point where a lot of people would not even pass card. They would they would try to attack the back straight from inside people's guard. That's where kind of law the inversions came along. And also what you saw when people hit takedowns is they would go straight from a takedown and they would try to get to the back within you know, as fast as they could they weren't interested in doing those traditional pit stops that a lot of you know blue and purple belts would do which is you know, stop at side control, you know, take a second consolidate your win and your points and then go to the next thing and then go to the next thing these guys wanted to go straight there. Now, this could just be kind of in a DCC thing. Thing again because of the to shoulder rule which is that you saw a lot of competitors that they were trying to keep their shoulders off the mat and in doing so maybe they expose their back and it's also possible that at this really high level a lot of people have figured out that it's just almost impossible to pass some of these guys and girls guards. So it's better for them to just try to attack leg locks and kind of chain that with taking the back interesting thing is that Keenan Cornelius did a podcast in the summer. On Flow grappling and he kind of predicted this he said that in this was, you know way before atcc and he said the way noogie grappling is shaping up right now. I think that passing the guard is going to become less and less important because people are just going to be attacking leg locks from the garden if that doesn't work. They're going to tries to go straight for back takes and I definitely felt like that was happening at a TCC. Also worth noting that the rear naked choke was the top finisher 80cc again. I think I'm going from memory. I think there were 35 submissions and nine of those were rear naked choke 6. While we're on the subject of numbers, which is one of our favorite things at high percentage. I think the order of submissions was rnc's was the first heel hooks where the second and then the third was Guillotines and I was actually was very pleased to see this because this really matches up with a lot of the data that we've collected we've shown that in noogie matches the top-performing submissions across all belt levels are rear naked choke so Guillotines armbars and Now atcc heel hooks are a hundred percent legal. So they're going to be much more represented. Some of the research that we've done has been across different formats where different kinds of leg locks were not always legal. So when you're at the high level basically if you hooks your legal, they're going to be very well represented. But you know, we also showed that Guillotines were really high percentage at the noogie level, even though in the ghee we have other data that shows that there are very very low percentage. And the last thing that was very much on meta that we saw at a TCC was bodylock takedowns. So this is really interesting because body luck takedowns in the data that we've done at high percentage are not really anything special most people get better results from single legs sacrifice throws or just leg trips. So I don't think bodylock takedowns is necessarily going to translate to other formats, but A TCC a great example. This was JT Torres, which is that there were other competitors and I saw this throughout the weekend that we're trying to get single legs. But because you had to get both shoulders on the mat if you just kind of visualize in your head what a single leg looks at, its your entire body versus one of their legs. That's the kind of Jiu-Jitsu aspect of it. But really that's only good for kind of getting there. But down on the mat. There's you are not going to have upper body control. You have to let go of the leg and sort of All up and we definitely saw that atcc. So the competitors that had a lot of success were people that were doing bodylock takedowns or we're doing that kind of like double Leg Takedown where you know you land right on their on their diaphragm on their chest and then you effectively have upper body control and those takedowns in my experience are pretty Advanced take down. So, you know, you saw that there were some really good wrestlers like JT Torres that could pull those off. then everyone else I think just wisely made the calculation that hey why why I'll just I'll get in the guard and I'll try to work my game and get in a good position in the first half of the match and then if not, you know, we'll see what happens in overtime kind of thing now to kind of circle back to the question that was poised at the beginning of the podcast which is our leg locks still essentially The Meta kind of front and center and I would say yes for the time being they are we saw a lot of heel hook finishes. Some people commented that there were not as many leg locks is there were was in a TCC 2017 and if you look at the breakdown of the heel hooks, actually a lot of them happened in the absolute Division and a lot of them happens because of Lockland and getting I think he got like four leglock finishes three or four in his absolute run and that without him maybe the statistics would have kind of evened out a little bit. However, I would say he's not an anomaly because he He's able to go in there and make really good use of that skill set. One thing that I saw in a TCC is that I I felt like there was a clear distinction between the new school leg locking crew. That was at a TCC and some of the old school and old schools Probably sounds more pejorative than I mean it to be but we see this all the time in our gyms at home, which is there are some students and there. In some cases entire gyms that they just don't do the leg lock thing and maybe they learned defenses to it, but it's just not part of their repertoire. Some of it is, you know, the tradition and the history of it that some people just don't really believe in it may be an old school mentality kind of thing. But I definitely saw that ACC there was even a moment and this was a moment that was almost a metaphor for the entire thing. I'm talking about which is buchecha versus Gordon Ryan and Gordon Ryan. Was you know working his game and buchecha of course is a legendary competitor and he's known for having a pretty fundamental old school game. I think it's safe to say and there was a moment where buchecha was not faring. Well, I think he was down on points and he actually sat down for a leg attack and Gordon openly laughed at him and then buchecha started laughing in the middle of the match and then the entire audience tonal was chuckling for a Moment and the joke was is that you know buchecha would just he's not the guy that drops back for leg locks and I don't know why he did that. Maybe it was a desperation because he was down on points or something like that.	1.0

It's the only thing those rumors really successfully did was raise the bar to an unobtainable level for the enhancing these Lindor Terry Scott sessions. So now anything that's not a complete highway robbery by the tribe, which the rumors that were out there. Absolutely were you and I have talked in this podcast that we don't know if the Dodgers straight up would do Lindor for Lux and if that was presented to you or I I think I would very strongly consider accepting that offer if I'm the Indians. Yet the offer was Luxe plus six other seven other nine other guys that were really really talented. So and in really nice lot money, of course and really didn't pass the smell test, but it did make for a fun at least 20 minutes or so of taunting you and whether or not I was actually being factual or not because I sent you the tweet and the Tweet went along with the build antonetti a statue Now text which if you receive both you Have understood my sarcasm, but when you didn't get the Tweet part of the text because you're in the air you only got the text message.

I think I screenshot of the tweet and try to send it to you that way but that also didn't go through and then I said something else which could have been interpreted as they just made this fantastic trade.

I often need to remove clutter from our bedroom dresser. We tend to accumulate stuff. So from time to time, I need to put those items away where they go. I think everybody has a surface in their house that attracts clutter. For me one of them is definitely the kitchen island is one and then the master dresser is one.	-1.0

Do you have any input there it to me when it comes to the safeties. It depends on what you want with them. Do you want the kind of steady solid all-around player? Beyonce Thompson who who's in who's just kind of good player, but he's more around it or do you want the ball skills of Thornhill former Corner who is really really strong and coverage and he's a guy who's going to create turnovers for you guys. That's the biggest thing for me with the receivers Hollywood Brown does worry me with an injury and he's also very very small and slight so I wonder if that could be a recurring thing Deebo Samuel would be my choice because as if I was going to go receiver because his route running is so Dynamic and I ever You came at the Senior Bowl. He was absolutely making top-flight corners of foolish out there. And and I think he's a guy who stuck drop because he didn't have the greatest year at South Carolina, but he's another solid player for so for me to be down between Samuel and Thornhill, but I'll defer to you if you want you to be one of those okay with you lean toward.	-1.0

I saw this guy with one leg and one doing things that normal people can't do all want to be and they're just It sparked that interest that made them want to create some adaptive diving here. And these guys have been making equipment for the Special Forces all around the world for a long time. It really could have they make such incredible new Ingenuity equipment that you know, it's just really great to use. I love it that just designed me a set of my own sins. We started this line called The Bionic AF, you know what that means? So the probably got a bionic a offline with short travel easy carbon fiber sins that are super super light and I like them short because I can't maneuver as well anymore with my diving leg my robotic diving leg because it doesn't really Bend at the knee whenever I want it to like you would if you're spinning with your normal leg. And so having these really long freediving sins and bulky scuba Sims makes it harder. So that made these really short wide powerful carbon fiber. Thins that I just amazing and then travel bags you can put all your stuff in a really awesome day say that's perfect for traveling really light really easy to use for me with one hand. So it's just cutting it back to the Simplicity of making diving not so complicated so we can just enjoy it.	1.0
So, how is how did you guys manage that like you both kind of were blowing up simultaneously. So how did that impact?	1.0
Yeah, and I think that's something that I would encourage like more Christians to think. about is that like is it possible that these people that do have a good amount of self-worth and that are happy and fulfilled in their life and you know are truly living like enjoy like is it necessary for you to then go and like tear that down to try to like put your belief system on them like you could be causing more her and more harm and I honestly think that that kind of is what happened when I was 12 like I was such a happy The little girl and like that didn't obviously go away overnight, but it was like I didn't necessarily like need these messages that they were telling me and they didn't they didn't help like they didn't make me feel better necessarily but I mean a lot of this like analyzing has come since I've left like, I don't want people to think that like I was miserable for 10 years because I wasn't like I still liked my time as a Christian, but it's just looking back. It's like, I don't know if I would Choose that again.	1.0

Thanks Jay. Couple of years off my life, but the craziest part to me was that there were some fans some Indians fans who were saying still probably not enough. I'm like, what are you expecting? I do think we need a little bit of a reality check when it comes to what fair trade offers would be. I think like I mean, I think the Dodgers are struggling to come to terms with the idea of even including Gavin Luxe by himself. Like that's it. Yet you're having people saying like Lux plus May plus Verdugo. I would definitely need all three of them and then it probably want like another piece or and it's like that's not how this works and teams treasure young controllable cheap Talent more than ever. And guess what the Dodgers have a really really smart front office. So yes, Dave you think you're sick of the Indians winning 90 plus games every year and not doing anything about it. Dodgers fans are so sick of the Dodgers winning. Seven straight NOS titles and having nothing to show for it with a massive payroll and robust farm system, but still their teams are disciplined and the Dodgers have a really good front office and they're not just going to throw everything at the wall to get Lindor for two years and maybe they could reassign them. But, you know teams just don't do that. I think it used to be a lot easier to pull off this sort of trade because there are there were more dumb front offices. I don't think I think there's only a couple of now and those teams probably are pretty bad. So you're not going to be dealing with them in this situation.	-1.0

And when you're in charge you have to make sure everything's happening to keep people safe and happy whether On a boat in a kitchen and a restaurant or through the entire country switch you're brushing to the bottom of your mouth and brush your molars in the way back. I'm speaking from experience here because I Rachel the Choppers lady. I'm in charge of chompers and I'm sort of in charge of all of you Champions. Well, I have to make sure that every morning and every night. There's a Choppers episode for you to listen to so that you chop Ian's never miss brushing your teeth. And part of my job is to remember to tell everyone to switch your brushing to the other side of the bottom of your mouth ambushed her front teeth, too. So you brush all of your teeth and not just so now that we know what it means to be in charge of a group it's time to make a choice which of these people is not in charge of a group the president of a country the chef of a restaurant or the captain of a boat are You have to come back to Choppers tonight to find out until then rinse with water before you leave to one.	1.0

I mean it Oh, I thought it was cell phones now and it's everything has a lot more urgency to it.	-1.0
Yeah, so as I mentioned before it's it's truly truly the heart. Work has been done by Justice Mesquita. I kind of just piggybacked off of him and but basically a couple years ago, he did a thorough study and evaluated the prospects that Green Bay tends to draft and the guys that they tend to drift towards when they're making their selections and I can honestly tell you they draft athletes for the most part. It's every single one of the positions has a couple thresholds, but they're pretty much all inclusive of basically speed agility and size depending on the position, but pretty much this is Speed and Agility. That's really all they're looking for. They don't care about strength. They don't care about a lot of other characteristics. I think quarterback offensive line and defensive back are and wide receiver. Those are the ones where they care about size for defensive line and Edge. There's this couple special calculations called. Oh my goodness. They're the basically their agility and speed calculations. The exact name of the calculations escaping me. It's not like a super well-known one. But if you ever want to know just reach out to me and I'll do a little bit of digging and I have it in my notes the gentleman who originated the formula, but basically there's a formula that calculates agility and speed using their three-cone time 40-yard dash their height and their weight and their certain threats certain thresholds that have been met in the past and certain thresholds that were looking for moving forward, especially with the Packers needing Edge help. Till I would say that they still need Edge help, you know, it's a good tool to look at and it's been a pretty good indicator and I know Justice Mesquita, he knows its edges, you know, he puts out those Force players every year. So they're pretty root pretty good indicators of relative success in the so I'm very excited to just keep updating it and updating it weekly currently with pro day numbers as new players who didn't test that the combine or players just who are improving on there. Numbers in general I'm pretty excited for what it's become and what it's growing into and definitely going to keep continuing this every year as long as the thresholds are going to hold true. Which last year. I think it was like seven seven of the players seven of the draft picks last year fell Within These thresholds, so I'm pretty excited for how predictive it was last year and what it might indicate this year.	1.0
So I actually put them on a hanger and put them and they're cute ones like there's	1.0
Like there's just a lot to consider though to you can't just go by Pasha and like that take off.	0.0

I know I'm loving it. I'm so glad you all enjoyed it and it's super interesting for me to hear about the connections with behavior because I do think there's like a primal element to intuitive eating that is hard to understand cognitively. But if you if you attach these behavioral principles that makes a lot more sense.	1.0
Yeah. I don't know if Ashley I would just down in Nevada. You want to Vegas we were talking at one of the Uber drivers about Opioids and stuff because we were when we're driving the ground to cover rougher part down and they were cut you just kind of surprised that we even do Narcan they were saying oh, yeah, we did we did start entering couple last week. He's like, why would you guys have that I would you guys help so I don't know if some of the some of the states are less open-minded to that sort of stuff. So no because I don't like California is but yeah California's a lot. BC from I understand but I think certain States down there are maybe not quite as open.	-1.0
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hell have you guys been to Pendleton?	1.0

Yeah, so she broke that which she did good. Yeah.	1.0
So coming back to you your point about deflation, which is something that I was considering to be the most likely initial outcome. Before we get some kind of inflationary bust and perhaps a collab complete collapse in currencies, which would love to get your view on in just a second. But so I can get my head round. How how does a deflationary environment unfold when there is so much QE going on there is so much intervention going on the so much debasement of these currencies and at the same time. I mean we're seeing Currencies and becomes like gold move up. How could these how could this actually mechanically happen?	-1.0
I would say I'm just curious because we definitely are bringing to talk about some other shows that people would say our garbage. Like I really think that we should do an episode on buzard Favre because that was so hated and also because I don't really like Jake Paul another Like to see him and the acting setting yeah, really really skimmed those episodes and we get to see what's Olivia Robidoux. Yeah, and it's like that's not High School Musical musical the series.	-1.0
Yeah, obviously I was joking anyway, so the Danbury podcast we talk shit about parenting we talk shit on our kids on our kids about our kids. Yeah. That's probably a better my friend my friend Pete here.	-1.0
The relationship well, was it open about our story is so for the first two years of us knowing each other. We were just friends platonic like we would just I was the homie and then we started dating, you know, we kind of dating but then like after about a few months like six months ironically enough. I was the one that was like we probably shouldn't date. And she was like, wow, I was like yo you about to do your thing. I'm about to do my thing. I really love our friendship and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that and I don't want to like you're supposed to you were young like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't want to resent you. I don't want you to resent me and so we kind of went back to friends and then a few years after that we kind of just Kind of grew apart, you know a little bit I moved out here to LA and and then one night. I'm in the club and I'm going to the bathroom and this girl is like oh, you know my homegirl Keisha and I'm like Keisha's fight me and she was like, yeah. I'm like call her. And she called her and we got on the phone and she can tell Amy left.	1.0
Yeah, you were super hot. I was writing a fucking computer.	1.0
But because I know my abilities and at the end of the day, you know in this business the opportunities that come your way or one thing, but the power that you have is the choices that you make so You can say no, you know what I mean. They were plenty of those 90s films that came my way that I was like, yeah. No, I'm good. All right, you know what I'm saying? And at the same time in the midst of that I did, you know a film for HBO called Daybreak. I did a film called deadly Voyage face, but you know what? I mean, I was throwing these curve balls out there. So you couldn't Typecast me.	-1.0
That's where it really	0.0
I always felt like shit. I always felt like damn. I'm such a loser I suck at everything and I can't impress nobody blah blah, and I've always wanted to feel good enough.	-1.0
I was just trying to look I try to remember when Max Scherzer signed his deal because in my mind, I was thinking it with with the Tigers. He didn't truly become really special until late into into his Tigers career who's kind of League average me a little bit better picture up until but very durable very durable true and that was part of Of his Allure, especially when he really took off in 2013. That was his first 200 Innings season. He puts it together another one with the Tigers in 2014. So he had put together back-to-back season was where he looked like a front of the rotation guy at 200 Innings, but he had done that at the age of 29. So he and his free agency entering his age 30 season. That's a lot different than another 2 years beyond that I'm saying for Clevenger. Maybe maybe he builds himself up to to that. sort of level consistent But as you said you would be risking it more as a team at the age of 32 and there are already people that were a little bit nervous I guess is the best way I can put it about the deal that Scherzer sign with the Nationals. And again, he did that entering his age 30 season. So that's a little bit of a different situation but that was a little bit surprising that to me sounded like the Indians rolling through all these names in the Dodger said, oh well, if you're going to roll through all these guys that you like we also would like to make a Of it at Clevenger and then the Indians being the Indians a team that is just there not going to hang up or in this case walk out the door. Just based on you bringing up a name. They'll say okay. Let's talk Clevenger. This is what are realistic thought is on him and they would discuss him and even by the Indians entertaining it just to say we would expect you to give up this completely unobtainable amount of talent in return for Clevenger. You've now quote unquote discussed it. No, I'm not we're not we're not sitting in there. I don't know how as you said I don't know how aggressive these talks actually work. But to me discussing it means that the Indians entertain almost anything and if the fact is that they spent four or five minutes talking about it. They have already discussed it and then at that point leaking that sort of report is factual you did discuss adding my Clevenger to it, but it was completely and totally off the table in terms of reality. That's just the way that I interpret it well and they always	-1.0

How does this is a know? I said, I wouldn't do this but a little side question when you talk about branding as I mentioned before that you like to get in front of camera, and I've noticed on your website. Everything you're not shy about putting your face and telling people who you are, which I love I love them and I say it all the time to people people buy from people. So, I believe that letting people know who you are and what you're about can only be a benefit in your business. How are you? How does that tie into your branding?	1.0
So we appreciate It well, thank you. You're welcome. And thank you as well and we'll be in touch sounds good.	1.0
Yeah. I've never like I always used to make fun of my mom when we were younger because she used to listen to like, what's the joy of em. Oh, yeah. I don't listen to the radio radio, but I listened to XM radio and so they have a channel called the message. And so which happens that a lot of the music that they play on the message. We actually played our church so it works out but like I just feel like when It's like almost like I'm praying to feel like just I'm trying to release it when I know that it's like I can feel it in my chest. Like I just sing really loud. Which yeah, it's I don't know. It's a whole article it is like the other day. I was listening to Skillet, which if you don't know who Skillet is there like a heavy metal Christian rock band, which you would never know there were heavy metal Christian rock, but you should listen if you'd have time go listen to Stars which is so good. It's like I was for the day I was driving to the mall before a thing that had to go to I'm just like I'm like, okay. Well, that's a fail because I'm like losing my makeup. You're not gonna do all this again. Yeah, but like, I don't know for me singing just like it's almost like it's like releasing from me to like just at least calm down and it's my way of prey like like an open loudmouth prayer of like, okay. I'm here. I just need some help. Yeah. Well, I realized that that that is helpful. I also understand that having a counselor or a doctor or those also like you have to have all of those components I think you yeah. To really make you feel like you can help help it kind of get under control. That's yeah, at least that's what works for me. I've probably become more spiritual and that respect and like in the last probably two years. It's like I would have never thought to like jump right into that be like, yeah. Okay, that's not that's not like I grew up in a church-going family. But like I haven't really like connected to that until like recently which is kind of cool. But yeah makes me feel better.	1.0

So there I will say this other this also is like it's like it for me. It's just like that standard joke. Let's take off the robe and have saggy boobs. You know, I mean, like I just really like I'm not saying everybody does it but I'm just saying like exactly what I'm talking about. It's just like it's kind of like that. I always used to say when I started doing drag I felt like every time I would go to drag shows before I see drag drag queens would do something and pull out a dildo and I remember starting to do dragon go I will do drag but I'm never bringing a dildo on stage like it was just like I was so tired of seeing it and again, I'm not saying, you know, you just brought up one person who did something similar to that. We've seen stuff like this before it's not new and creative had it been new and creative and fit the song. I would be all for it a hundred percent behind it. It just didn't make sense with the song. I just felt like she was reaching in trying to win the challenge which is the point you're trying to win the challenge. She reached into her bag of tricks and said I'm going to try this and see if it works and it well. I think that Trinity was giving her season 9 like reference but she was doing the Charlie hides. Yeah the whole pining and I thought I was funny. Yeah. Mmm, I didn't catch that. She should have just this Charlie heights. Yeah, well You just as try. Haha. That's funny.	-1.0
Yeah, well love while stuff. So again, we'll see I will keep you all updated when we get some some proper dates and will also let you know since Lee Daniels is on it. I'm pretty sure this is going to go to the Silver Screen. But again, a lot of these ball picks up going to like lifetime it BTW and stuff. So I'll hope that they you know end up giving it more Justice and put it on the movie theater. So, you know, we'll see how this one goes second bit. Is Wu-Tang they're going back on tour. This is going to be a majority worldwide tour. Obviously, they're going to be in the States but the majority of the legs of the tour or going to be overseas. They are going on tour with Public Enemy and they lost soul and this is going to be called the gods of wrapped or and it starts actually on the first weld it with this is when it did let's give me this one when to take it when I say, oh, I'm sorry, but the actual leg the first leg starts in London on May the 10th, but when they come back to the States, they're going to be in flocks area and going to be in Chicago on June 1st, and then they're going to be in Cleveland Simpsonville, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Asheville Boston on Cassville. I think that's in Connecticut and Landing City Seattle Mountain View, California, Wichita, Kansas Council Bluffs, Iowa, I think and me and hapless, Minnesota on August 2nd. What to end the tour now I know that we did talk about will take last album, which we didn't think was very good. But I'm more than certain expenses just going on tour Public Enemy. They'll also they're going to be doing a lot of old stuff like that's that's just what it is, especially for the we talked about this before as well how a lot of a lot of people overseas like that's where they get their money and if you can still go overseas and still perform all your old hits, then you're still popping and people overseas love love artist over here and they love all of Their old stuff that they that they came out with over a year. So how you feel about this tour with this be something that you will be slightly interested in since they're coming to school.	1.0
I'm like really Jamie just causes frustration for everybody.	-1.0
You know, how much did you have to adapt to that to now all of a sudden you're famous, you know, right.	1.0
Like what's yeah, I think to like just know that it's it's a legitimate real struggle and it's okay like you're not inconveniencing anyone you're not you know, like I think two people are like I'm so sorry. I'm a And it's like that's but that's part of you. That's all of you. You know that the good the bad the not so good and I think like if you can't take me with my the best of me you're at can't take the well, well they say with if you can't have the worst of you can have the best of me kind of right have you got it's all the all makes you part of it, you know, like for us to like some of that achieving that anxiety kind of helps us to achieve more and the you know me like worrying about people and caring that makes me really caring person. So there are aspects of anxiety that are good. I think it's just when it gets out of control and it becomes like a train that just won't stop and you can't make it.	1.0
Yeah kudos to Mitchel Musso so you can have a bad writing and you know, it's so funny it but it's the acting that saved it. I think yeah the actors in the show our good good and bad how I have it depends on how you're talking about because I think Mitchel Musso is really good in this episode.	1.0
I've been to I never get done you've been there. For six hours, but time you get there a little bit early and you watch and they have the Indian relay. They have the Indian relay races and I mean it in a policy say the way when I say your be there for six hours. I mean, it's six hours of fun. But time you go to The Letter Buck room and you go to the when you go to the rodeo starts and they have like I said the Indian relay races The Wild Cow Milking and they Buck, you know, 20 whore 20 bare backs 20 Bronx a bunch of bulls have did they have you know, there's just a whole bunch of Stuff and and and it's awesome. It's just so I guess what a person has to really be cognitive of is that it's not always about this. Like it's there rodeos aren't just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter everybody and every Rodeo has a different, you know different way of marketing their deal and that's what I think is pretty really pretty cool about the West Coast rodeos in particular. Is that whether you're at Salinas with the bullfights and what's going on and the California rodale and then you go to the Pendleton with the with the Native American You know history involved in the Tepee Village and all that all all even over to Joseph Organ, you know where that you know Chief Joseph days. I really felt celebrate the best Perce tribe and all that's going on. It's just a lot a lot of different things that play into how they Market their rodeos and how they do their thing is and each each one's different a little bit but really kind of there's a lot a lot to to see in a lot to check out. It's really cool. I think. So, like I said, it's not there not just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter there. It's there's just each one's a little bit different and I like it.	1.0

So what are you guys thinking so far? Do we love it?	1.0
I know what you're saying. I mean you are you know, and as teachers, you know, we can also model this and obviously honor did and I'm sure you are as well. But as we are walking in the hall and we see up here, you know make eye contact and smile and say good morning or good afternoon or or something like that. I think that you know, I I know that you know, I've been in a lot of schools to where you know, you have teachers to get together and you know, when you get a group of girls together, sometimes sometimes we're not so nice and but sometimes you know, you see this kind of get-together chat chat chat or a teacher will be having the students come in and another teacher will join in and ask a question. And then meanwhile, there's interaction students are watching that so if we are if we were showing kindness to whoever is here, or if that conversation is anything less than kind about maybe a little gossip going on right students are noticing this so Be the person you want to see in your classroom. And of course, there's all types of great books out there on kindness and being paying it forward and you know being a good human. So those are things that we're going to want to incorporate in our classroom, but I think reading the books and checking that off. The list is not enough right? It's not enough to show, you know, the person that we want to	1.0

Okay at this point. Gone, like if I'm genuinely fearful for my life while I'm waiting the treatment of the show. I'm pretty much sure I'm going to do it. Yeah, so I know there's another one we did last year where we are on the back of the boat, and we wanted to test this Blood myth where you know, sharks can smell a drop of blood in 10,000 legs of ocean. And so we went to the Bahamas and there was 25 feet of water with tiger sharks bull sharks hammerhead sharks nurse sharks everywhere and we drained half a liter of My Blood Out It into a bag and I jumped off the back of the boat and swam away and then ripped open the bag. I was surrounded by this huge plume of my blood just to see what would happen in hindsight that doesn't seem very clever. It was kind of fun.	1.0
Well also, lets so a lot of times we record these pretty late at night and I'm like, I'm just beat I'm tired. I'm subdued and so has pointed out to me by a friend of the podcast.

The Selby is God cast is brought to you by and this is just like such a difference and that's why like this wrote this this podcast is a roller coaster never want people to feel completely comfortable and if we can keep that as the general theme of this damn thing and I feel like we've done our jobs.	-1.0
And I thank yous on be mom for bringing up what I think I mean a lot of this is tough and driving, you know, we don't live in the suburbs, but I can imagine that would be fucking real nasty, but we have cars.	-1.0

Pretty sure he is like a game post.	1.0
That's true. So I want to I want to wrap this up here soon. But you know, we have our notes here that we've kind of been glancing at we there's a there's a thing at the end of our notes and it says we're different people though.	1.0
So embarrassed right now. It's one of those things like I found myself doing a lot. I'll go all week. I'll fast like, you know till like 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon and then, you know eating really healthy. Dinner and then Friday comes and it's like gung ho Pizza Sushi Chinese food, like wherever Wings blue cheese like come on bring it on because I was good all week and I think about and you could probably you're the expert but what that does to your metabolism. I mean it has to affect it. You're not neutral neutralizing or giving nutrients to your body.	-1.0
Miami I would want a hotel and also the beginning of the episode starts out with my Lee Jackson fighting over which rum mammals going to stay in either Miley's rumor Jackson's room, which if you know Hannah Montana at all, you know, there's an entire episode dedicated to how disgusting and unlivable the conditions in Jackson's remark and yet they still make mamaw like stand there and watch it there, but just because I'm pretty sure that that episode doesn't happen until am not a hundred percent sure, but I'm pretty sure that episodes For this one, so I didn't get that. I got really confused.	-1.0
Like if it really I think the biggest part that people don't hit enough of consistently is just through the nutrition because if like there are the I've had clients that aren't extremely active. I have a 59 year old client. She was 278 pounds when we first met and she's lost 57 pounds. She's now in like 2:17 to some and for her to do it and she has any issues and she's five two five three this Asian lady. The biggest thing that we just focus on was her nutrition and she countered a calorie she weighed her food out. She kept her diet simple and she was losing weight. You know, we I was she trained with me two times a week and then I had her come and once on the weekend by herself and literally I would just prescribe her 20 minutes of cardio 10 minutes before ten minutes after a little bit of free weights here and there a little bit of machines and over time. It was really the nutrition that guided her to get to where she wanted to be, you know, so I think for a lot of people the nutritional part is hard, you know food is our Escape is definitely my Escape black. I love food, you know, but, you know a little bit of sacrifice like during the week and then you get enjoy yourself on the weekend. I think he's really again all about balance if you have 30 days if you're good, 25 out of those 30 days most likely you'll have results right always tell people Good day of bad eating or one bad day of eating will not hurt you in one good day. Beauty will not help you. It's really just about what are you doing for? The most part right? Don't focus on the little things. What are you doing on the bigger picture? Yeah like that.	1.0

It's Disobedience, but we justify it by saying Well, everybody's doing it we justify it by saying well, you know like Like I mean the the common practice of today like it's okay nowadays, right? That's why it's so important to filter like how we think and the things we say and what we do Through the Bible.	-1.0
I mean there were so many different aspects of it. You know, one of the aspects was this idea. Like I started viewing Christianity differently and I know a lot of Christians will probably disagree with this interpretation, which is totally fine. I just think it's important to realize that there are a lot of people out there. There who will hear the gospel message and they'll interpret it in kind of the way that I started seeing it and it's not necessarily always healthy because I remember looking back and you know asking myself like why I could never bring myself to get baptized even though so many people encouraged me to do it and I think part of me subconsciously disagreed with this idea of like dying to yourself like this. Idea that you are your intrinsic self needed to die that there wasn't anything like good about you. Unless God was living in you and you were reborn as Christ and it just seemed so hurtful to me and like looking back now. I don't think I ever felt broken enough to need a savior. My self-image wasn't bad enough like my life wasn't shattered enough for me to view myself. Business like dirty rags that God Compares artworks to in the Bible and this just kind of made me see how religion doesn't work as well. If you start out with a healthy amount of self-worth because then when I was going through harder times in life, I remember thinking how easy it would be to like go back to church and to feel better and you know, there would be so many people who would instantly care about And it give me attention and support and comfort me and try to make me feel better. And that was so appealing but it made me realize how this idea of God and religion could so easily be used as a Band-Aid like for our problems. It made me feel like religion was like preying on the weak and in those vulnerable moments, like it's so easy to want a savior, but I needed to like pull myself back into reality and be like Intellectually, though. This doesn't add up in my head. So like I don't know. I didn't want to take the easy way out and just like go back and then oh gosh, like there's just so much of out of this is how I felt but it's like you're not capable of anything without God and everything good is because of him and everything bad is because of you and like he deserves all the glory and you're just a vessel completely worthless without him and Like if you leave God your life will be miserable. And that's what I was always told and that's I think what really hurt me afterwards like when I was like, I don't believe this anymore like but people are still telling me like he needs to be the priority in your life. And like if he's not bad things will happen to you and like yeah this one time. Yeah like this one time my friend. I was telling her that I had filled out this job application and it was a writing application. So I had to write like a ton of like not essays but like a lot of prompts and then I hit submit and my internet had gone out and it got all deleted and instead of just being like yeah, that sucks like, you know the internet but she was like wow God is really trying to get you back and in my head I'm like God is going out of his way to like make my life miserable so that all come back to him like that doesn't make any sense. Like, how do you I don't know how can you think that way because that just sounded like manipulation.	-1.0

Yeah sure this year. They were really fucking bad like literally like I government shutdown to fucking cross shit.	-1.0
Yeah, well, I think that is a really good point and it still is intuitive because when we make certain decisions about what we eat, we're always weighing our values against each other. So in the moment if you like, what are you going to value with the decisions that you make around food? So are you valuing convenience and ease or are you on another situation or another day valuing like feeling good in your body or feeling like one day is it spontaneity? JT and then the next day. It's like Integrity because you told yourself you were going to you know, eat a certain way and so it's okay for those values to change on a day-to-day basis and you always need to check in with yourself again to figure out like what am I what value am I honoring with this decision around my food? Also. It's like we all just have we all have different values and different priorities and you know, I'm a chef. I'm somebody who loves to cook so I know you would always say like you're so not lazy. I actually think it's fun to make my own cashew milk and I enjoy the taste if you don't it's okay not to do all those things, but can you find you know, can you still find balance and challenge yourself to maybe step out of your comfort zone a little bit if you do prioritize your health and if you do want to take care of your body without it being like a chore because if it's a chore, you're just not going to do it ever or stick to it, right?	1.0
Maybe having a coffee station in your formal dining room. But at this house are Keurig is in the kitchen and then I guess the coffee station mentality is still there because I have a little sign about coffee and I keep some bugs and teas and sugar right above the Keurig. So it's still that concept of having everything right there where you need it to make coffee. But it's in the kitchen now, but consider having a coffee station somewhere else. You can get a lot of cute ideas for that on Pinterest. Hopefully you've had enough time to straighten up your living areas.	0.0

No. One and and I was really in the snowboard. I still am in the snowboard. I said a word all the time and we had this local little Hill in Indiana where I grew up and my uncle worked there and I was able to always take cameras and these were different cameras at the time. So now we're talking like late 2000s mid-2000 like Sony Handycam exactly TV Sony handycams. I had I had the first Sony Handycam that was the HD 1080p model, but that was kind of like senior year of high school. I don't want to jump too far ahead. But dude, I was the typical. Later kid with a camera, you know, we've all heard that story. You know, I filmed my brother. We filmed each other skating we film snowboarding, but it was cool because I manage the terrain park at this local Hill. I don't call it of ski resort. It was a hill, but we had a kick-ass Park man. It was really cool like we there was huge jumps for how small this place was. We built we would go in and Weld and paint the rails in the summer. So then we would beat they'd be all new for the winter time. But what was cool as we had this part crew and they were all the best Riders from kind of around, Indiana in Northern, Kentucky. Leave it or not. Yeah, there's Northern Kentucky snowboarders.	-1.0

Welcome to the wrong culture podcast. My name is Dane ver way. I'm an experienced Runner and running physiotherapist. I created this podcast not only so I had an excuse to talk running each and every week something that I love to do, but more importantly this podcast gives me the opportunity to interview fellow Runners friends and health professionals in a relaxed and easygoing format. This podcast is designed for the everyday Runner so we can all live learn. Grow and enjoy everything there is to running together. I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome back to episode 17 of the wrong culture podcast today. I interviewed a man Clark one of the athletes are coach from the Run culture hours. This is the third time I've caught up with Damien over the past six months. Although as you'll hear today's episode is a little bit different Damien's had a setback. He's recovering from an injury. He's had a month off running. Whereas over the past 2 episode Damien couldn't put a foot wrong. To in pee I have to pee. I love this podcast episode for a number of reasons one because I feel like a lot of people can learn from it anyone who's currently injured. I think we'll be able to learn and just sympathize with Damien over the past month and what he's going through. Damien also shows a fair bit of maturity in this episode. He's learned a lot since he had a major injury this time last year and he's definitely gone about this injury a whole heap better in terms of how he's viewed it and and Managed IT. He certainly has stopped listen to it and tried to get on top of it straight away. I also liked this episode because it shows that her load management isn't in tight tirely. The reason for this injury. So we've Damien. Yeah, he missed last season's track season and then we started introducing spikes so that it could do his 1500 and 5K races. And yeah, he's got saw in his foot because he started to use this. Spike's more but really the way that we introduced the spikes was very slow. And a lot of people would have been able to tolerate this load. So it shows that how how everyone's different and we learn from our experiences. So Damien and I will be better for this. We all know that okay, we have to ease our way forward and slowly build Damien's tolerance to track spikes and the speed work involved on the track. And this will come all right enough for me. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Okay, here we are again with Damian Clark and I will catch up.	1.0

I wanted to stay out of this because how TI raises his family ate my concern and it ain't my business. However, I am absolutely a here for a larger conversation about how girls and women's bodies are constantly being policed. Now, I will always be bothered by the fact that we are so consumed and fixated on the sexual behavior and the bodies of girls and women and I mean by both men and women case in point how many times have you heard men and some women but mostly men say they don't want a girl because then they have to worry about her getting pregnant or they don't want a girl because they don't want to think about all the boys and men trying to have sex with her and someday it will It their attitude is based off their own personal experience. They knew there was a time when they weren't shit, so they didn't want their own daughter exposed to some Reincarnation of their ancient Indus. So before a girl is even born before she even gets here people already policing her body. Now we have to deal with that our entire lives as women. Not just for my fathers brothers or Uncle's women can be just as guilty I often say this when discussing racism and racial oppression. Ian the real unfairness of dealing with those issues is that the burden and responsibility to solve the problem is placed squarely on the people most victimized by it. So when we have these conversations about rape and sexual assault the conversation is solely centered around women and what we need to do to protect ourselves. There's certainly a place for that but who is having conversations with young boys and men about consent about respect about keeping their hands to themselves if you don't want some asshole boy dish. Affecting your daughter then use that same energy with boys that you have when you want to police girls and women about their bodies instead of telling boys and men and run through as many girls and women as possible. If you want girls and women to be treated better. If you want us to be respected. It's simple raise better men stay on bothered.

If you happen to buy a bull that was you know, the similar genetic line do you have well, I you know, I it's not so much about when I'm riding bulls as much as you know, like I said, I like the speedballs because I grew up around them. But then for me now I like going back to any Anything that that's related to page blood and that's just because of value, you know, we were talking about jive turkey while ago again, he comes up and Toby Floyd rays that go but he's out of a page bull.

Absolutely, amazing eyesight. They pay for me to do incredible things that people don't get to do I swim with great white sharks without a cage where she does that although it is kind of like every year makes me wonder how Discovery Channel's going to try and kill me this year and last year. I did a survival show with a British Special Forces Guy where we parachuted from 15,000 feet directly into the Pacific Ocean for 44 hours with no food. No water surrounded by sharks was the fairgrounds or else? No, not the Bear Grylls last night. It was a guy called James glancing who was a royal Marine 44 hours at the ocean. Yeah. That was it's a long time. These aren't you can understand how hard it is when you're bouncing around the ocean. You're tired. You're hungry you're thirsty and trying to cut. Hole in the butt of your wet suit while you're moving around too. So you can poop student suit. You can't sleep in the suit get a rash. Yeah, I thought that was the second one the E before they blew up our boat off the coast of the Bahamas and we drifted through the ocean again through the Atlantic surrounded by Oceanic whitetip sharks, which are the sharks blame for the biggest shark attack in history the at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. So there was Reportedly 300 American Sailors were eat by these sharks. So it was kind of you know, I wasn't just a survival thing was a message about shark conservation and what to do if you're stranded and you lose your boat, but also telling the story of these Sailors, so it was a really great thing to be a part of was there any part of you?	1.0
Yeah. I think I was listening to and I mentioned you guys that she the on Joe Rogan November 7th episode 1379 there was Investigative journalist, his name was Ben Westhoff, and he wrote a book called fentanyl Inc. How Rogue chemists are creating the deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic and he just talks about it like him when he went to you goes to China and it's like the drug dealers are kind of making this stuff and I cheap it is to get hold of this stuff. Right? It's insane which is why everyone's cutting it with cutting it into everything. It's just it's a quick easy boost. I think he said something like it's just like 50 times. Stronger than heroin so to Rice grains of it basically can can absolutely decimate it like insanity episode 2 listening to you.	-1.0
Yeah, and I think one thing you were saying to that or when you were talking that made me think of it is like eye for me like when I'm feeling anxious, I feel like everyone around me knows it. Oh for sure, but I'm really good at hiding it sometimes not necessarily around my kids or my husband. Because you day just kind of always get the worst of you unfortunately because they know you the best but you know, like tally your spouse or tell your kids like I've gotten into the Habit where I'll just tell the least like Haley some really struggling right now. Just give me a minute. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be short with you because I think like just saying it out loud is like this is a real thing. Like if I had a headache I would say hey, I have a headache or I sprained my ankle or whatever. It's like this is a real thing like this is Real condition that I have and you know, it's really flaring up today are probably having a rough day with it and just having somebody to that you can reach out to and sometimes like just laughing about how ridiculous anxiety is because it can get you like the other day Dex came home from school and he just I go are he just doesn't seem like himself. He just seems kind of sad and so are goes. Hey, buddy, so Dax is for okay, he goes hey, buddy. Do you have any pain in your back or your legs or your neck and that's was like I don't think so and here it looks at me and he goes well sometimes kids have cancer, you know, and that's how they find out about it and I was like what the hell if you can't say that to me and then I my brain like when you know, of course like, you know, I have a kid with cancer and how am I gonna deal with this and my mom has cancer but it's like I just had to kind of laugh and just shut it down and be like, nope. We're not gonna yeah. We're not gonna go there. Because it's not doing anything now, sometimes I've heard people what they'll say. Well what if this what if this and then they'll take it all the way? Yeah. Okay. Well, what if that does happen? Hmm. Well, okay. Well what you know and then just kind of played out and I mean even if the worst possible thing for to happen, there are people who they're resilient that you know, we will carry on and so I think it's hard at like it's easy right now to talk about all this because We're not in the middle of like an anxiety storm because with wait till this afternoon is this weekend, right?	-1.0

So it was not needed that anybody tax tax funded education either either Elementary education middle schools high schools throughout the university and so on it was just being handled anyway, and it's true. So this case great great latitude like greater responsibilities to parents who I'd known all parents will beat their children to high school or addicted to the you to the university and so on. Yeah, I think that that would probably the better situation than we have at present in any case people would have much sound ideas as far as all social political questions are concerned because they would not be systematically biased the system that we have right now. I know exactly how it is in the UK, but I see this year in France. And in Germany is the educational level diminishes every year and we've observed with for the past 40 or 50 years. I mean read the level of Education actually diminishes. So they're doing a very lousy job as far as the quality of education is concerned and if you listen to the education bureaucracy in France, the main concern is not really the level of academic achievement. It's equality. So they want to have student populace that is equal. So we want to prevent it some people get ahead of others and get a head start when it comes to the professional life. And so also they want Everybody to be on the same on the other on the start line at the age of 18 or 19 or whenever they leaving school. That's their main objective is not to teach anybody to help people. They just want to make them equal.	-1.0

She doesn't understand what's happening. All she thinks is that her son is getting like a tact and so she's just coming to His defense like I'm not gonna like argue with her something and I said something like that was like I'm not gonna argue with her or say anything mean to her. She's just a mom were looking out for her child, whatever and I was kind of the end of that and then it came out that like she was hacked or something like they hacked her account to do all this.

Yeah, you're right. We're starting to give the territory where you get to groupthink with these pics, but A reason why the no offense selection specifically to Green Bay is such a popular one. He fits indeed. It's a good fit for the offense on top of that just like every other player. We're going to pick today. He fits what Green Bay is looking for at the position. He meets their thresholds easily. So I think that Noah fan is an easy selection here, but I'm curious who else is on the board. I may be you said it I just missed it, but I didn't hear Drew lock either.	1.0

Yeah, it's weird but not as good and you know, like I say and some phenomenal This is one of the ladies I coach Jennifer at. Oh sir. She is 50 years old and she finished. I think I trained her little bit too. Well, I coached in a bit too. Well because she was only like 14 minutes behind me or something. And so thankfully, I mean not that it wouldn't be terrible if she'd beat me but you know, I'm competitive I don't you know, she she did really well and she was wrapped and up the first series. The name of the first woman and then was a lie someone I've never met her before.

Google so we bought our tree on Saturday and because they fucked up the trunk as I said this on the live earlier, right? So like usually the tree place trims the trunk and trims the shitty branches the bottom of the tree cleans it up for you and I think because we bought a tree from like this look specials rack and we didn't realize it the guy didn't give us any fucking but he didn't even put it in the tree stand with a lot of times I do for you to have to worry about that. You didn't do that. So we get home and I get rid of some of these shitty branches and there's like two feet of just bear trunk. Mama Bear was not having it. So we didn't end up decorating on Saturday night. How tall is the tree at the end like four feet? No, it's actually still pretty tall because we got one without all that it was like bumping the top of the ceiling we have tall ceiling. Yeah, so we didn't end up decorating them Saturday night, which was the plan. So on Sunday morning. I had to saw part of the tree off with a hand saw and then we decorate it on Sunday afternoon and the entire time we're doing a time like I am so glad my nine-year-old is 9 years old so that he can decorate the tree so that I don't have I can do it except I still had to do wrap around with this is the worst part wrap around with the lights that and then like the beads and all that shit.	-1.0

Just one final question before we go to Media pigs. If there was when you're talking about Fair currencies, you're looking at the selection of the the least worst options compared to Gold. What is the least worst currency that you can see? Would it be the Swiss franc? Would it be the Japanese Yen who've given that Japan has just come out of a deflationary. Situational tamizh dong what?

Oh my God. He's honestly the greatest human being he's just like so so I mean knock on wood thing.

They just absolutely spectacular. Yeah, it looks amazing. I mean, there's no water so you've got to make sure you carry him off of That yeah, you know luck is no way you can like even if you ducked it like a yellow one of the righteous up here if you kind of run out of water you can duck off to a creek but there's nothing out there is no but it is the views as just something else especially first thing in the morning or late at night. It's yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Awesome. Now, I have a question. I need I need to know the best cow story there is no I'll say this to our viewers. It's Every time that I see Instagram post, yeah, you've got a picture of a cow and we begin it would appear that you just run from cow Paddock to capitec taking photographs of cats. So a lot of cars out here are the nights have been chased by pi was bloody scary. I love cows out here pretty freaky some acute, but most of them are so creepy. Yeah. It's scary fast. Thank you guy fast actually my day. Yeah, we do agree with that tonight when they get up and go their dog. Yeah. Well, I do a lot of running on my own most of it's on my mind and I'm going to entertain my little brain somehow. So I do take a lot of photos and put them on my Facebook page and make fun of myself. Do you do a very you do a very good job of taking photos of cows? And getting the perfect putting the putting this perfect captions to it. It's the largest is you look at the pattern. Yeah, but then you read the caption and you always end up doing yes. If you didn't jump did you actually burn that's the question exactly.	1.0
So I had certain clothing that I would wear and make sure you know, I had my earbuds ready and I would you know sports bra was definitely a requirement. I'd have all that stuff kind of laid out. So then when I'd wake up man, I really don't feel like running.	-1.0

But so I mean, yeah you like you he hoped to still you down into a DP and then the result of that was you start actually D peeing on the short films that we worked on together, right? You know, it was two weeks after I started by two weeks that we did the 48 Hour film project in Salt Lake two weeks after Drew started and we won and we well we won the audience award which I like for me.

Mmm and stream Anna Santana did come back and have a hell of a year best year. He's ever had so Yeah, I guess we'll see.

So many I can't even keep up.	1.0
Well it to me, it sounds I didn't hear John William. So I think that strong consideration has to be given to Jonah Williams. Now my consideration there with Williams is that I know that there's not a lot of concerns with him being able to move to the right side, but I think he's best suited as a left tackle. Now a lot of those skills are translatable. However, that doesn't mean every single player can go from one side to the other and Not entirely sure, you know that they want to try and do that. It kind of depends. I I think if they take if they take Williams, I think that that's a that's a luxury pick for them at that point. But how about you go through maybe the top ten that draft network has there that at 12 basically?	1.0
So they're pregnant for 11 months 11 days. Wow.	1.0
So yeah, so I'm straining with the guys and of course I want to involve my wife as well. So from time to time and train with her bought a pair of kettlebells bought a pair of dumbbells, but a pair of rings so I wasn't yeah. It's that bad made up my own plyo box at home. If you check out my Instagram my you will still see the plyo box that I made and it's really scary because as you jump at the top it's really wobbled really you so and yeah while training my wife my wife have a good friend of hers who wants to train as well who have a difficult time losing weight.	1.0
Well, what movie was it - why I want no say it. That was another one. I didn't want to do it, but I'll let the team at the time he was Like really big on the international disrespect to the right of the Rector, but they were like, he's gonna be the next hot thing and Bubba Bubba and I just knew. Like I was of the generation that they were trying to sell that movie too, and I'm like we don't care about the story line like we don't relate to this whole Mod Squad thing the child put we don't but you know the opportunity to work with Giovanni Ribisi and Claire Danes on the face of it.	-1.0

I guess so out the gate you do juice and you did do some TV stuff in between but movie. Why's your first three out the gate is juice the program and Higher Learning you did Major League to so that's a to yes. That's sure that's that's your for still out the gate. That's a pretty crazy start. What was that time like for you then it was surreal.	1.0
I honestly think that this is a this type of situation that we're going through right now is ideal. Feel for a trade down Drew lock is sitting there with some team licking their chops trying to get ahead of the of the Washington Redskins. I honestly think that they could they could get a pretty good haul if they traded out of this position you trade down a few spots, maybe four or five and you're still getting Jonah Williams Noah fan TJ Hawkinson greedy Williams, even who I would be completely okay with Green Bay spending a first-round pick, even though they spent so much draft capital on the position. You know, I you can never have too many corners, especially In and defense, excuse me, like like Mike patents. However, it's obviously a luxury to spend on a corner. I think at this point, I'm not ready to spend a top-15 pick on Devon Bush. That's my honest feeling about that. I think I think Brian Burns would be the selection for me here if if we had to take a selection at 12.	1.0
I know when I saw baby in Sydney, I felt like I already knew her because we constantly are watching you on Instagram. So it's kind of nice, you know to finally meet in person and you're one that likes	1.0
So so I work like a 16-hour day. I came home. I was tired. I just wanted to you know throwing CNN and have a glass of wine go to sleep. And my wife was like Hey, you know, he's still up my son is still up and he was two years old and I was like I'll get to and she kept nagging me about it, and I thought to myself. At least I'm here, you know and then that thought kept echoing in my head because it of course I love my kids, you know, but I was just like damn where did that come from? You know, what does that mean? Like because obviously I like I love my kids more to love myself, but that's that's what kind of got me on that Journey but it's interesting what you say like with these statistics of now because and I touch on this in my book like when I was growing up, You are eyeball if you knew your father like I only knew two dudes who knew any fathers and we used to look at them like y'all weirdos. Yeah, you know and that's how much we had. We had rationalize that trauma and and I think that's a generational thing too. I think you know when you go back, I mean, we're not gonna go too far back, but let's just say from like Vietnam era right you go back then you got a lot of cats coming back home. They on drugs a lot of cats are going to jail and heroines hitting in then the 80s come around. You know for us it's like my mom always says like my generation is like yo, we did the Civil Rights thing y'all go get the bag. You know what I mean? It's like every generation has another thing so you have a lot of you know, a lot of us people my age would whether you college educated or not, you know the out there not just with jobs, but with some form of a career, you know, and they come from not having that think so. Everyone is like we're trying to reverse that cycle or break the cycle, you know what I mean?	-1.0

Remember Duran's guys where we talk about one thing from the episode that really grinded our gears and we just really need to Hash it out. Out right here for you guys. You have one I did we did sort of touch on it, but it was Reggie and his storyline. Well bringing his father in I feel like I should be more sensitive about this, but honestly, I'm just like, where is this coming from? It's very left field. And again, like is this just going to go away and then we don't see Mark for like eight episodes and he randomly comes back in.	-1.0
We'll get it. We'll get a person. Yes, I like that.	1.0
So when there's the rodeos where they only have right hand shoots Well, Jack turkey doesn't go, you know, you know, that's just a way that's got to be, you know, he and I only got a couple bulls that way but you know, he once they get to where they're pretty shiny in there and they're that good you don't really want to mess him up.	-1.0
Okay. So Scandal wise like by this time when you were having like issues with that interview and you're already having a little bit of blowback Scott stands or rampant during this time, right? Look, I can't even remember.	-1.0
Oh, yeah. Nice. That's cheesy like FM phones up like worried to be like always worried about what what's going to happen with this Maps because I don't think valve communicate that well. With the mappers and people who get their Maps included in the game or anyone for that matter. So I think it's a probably a sigh of relief for him who I'm sure it does a lot of this stuff by himself without even talking about like for example with a simple graffiti that's on cash under Heaven on be site. He did that himself. It's not it's not actually a major a major moment graffiti by Valve. It's a graffiti. He added by himself picking up from from the major.	1.0

This is the content it makes a lot more sense to every 100 percent and the fact that we get to do just some basic steps together and just show America what it's supposed to look like. So like let's say Argentine to our just a regular Tango, right Ballroom Tango. They show like I don't know. How long is it like 20 seconds of it, but they show what it's supposed to look like. So in the audience at home is watching they can relate to it. Okay, that's what it's supposed to look like. Well his I'm wasn't exactly like that. So I guess I see what Lana is talking about. Exactly. It's tough.	1.0

What when I cry now when you let down when you're in the dark, it's interesting because what I was going to say, there is like when I go for a training run, I generally go for a training run to go in unless in letting you know like out for at the speed session or something and then you know, nothing happens my brains just blank but like if I if I'm where I generally go for a run. That's the reason I like to go running is to going woods, but when I'm right See, I spend meetings far too much time going inwards. And so that's when I like to chat to you know, someone else that I'm racing with and like a hilly course is brilliant for that because on a hill that apart from the elites there aren't too many people who run them. So even though you're puffing up a hill you can actually get you know, a broken conversation going and generally you'll pass like once you 10 10 caves in Two arrays generally then sitting with all the people you probably going to spend most of the rest of the race with and so you get to know people pretty well. And so you can you know, like they can pull you out and you can pull them out and I remember my strongest memory ever was a guy that I was passing and he was out of gels and he didn't realize it he asked if I could take a gel out he got to the stage where he was so wrecked. That the concept of taking his pack off and being out of jail was too much and I gave him one of my gels because he actually run out and there was no way that he was 15 case the next checkpoint and that giving him in my gel made me run faster than if I'd use the gel myself. Yeah because you have someone yeah, and it's and it helped him and after the race he came and thanked me and said I wouldn't you know, you would have never finished the rice if it wasn't for that. Yell at that moment. And yeah, that's probably my favorite memory of racing, you know in all my running. So that's that's my thoughts are going in and out and that's what's so beautiful about an altar and Ultra is it's an entire life in one quick run. Really? Everything is Chandni you end up crying end up hurting you end up falling you end up cheering you sing. You don't seem like there's just Everything in there and that's that's why I love it. So well, I guess I about Lauren's music choice to is she likes rock and roll. I keep trying to convince her to listen to an alternative to rock and roll, but I haven't convinced yet. Well, I do like lots of different kinds of music, but I think you like the Techno stuff which I'm not such a big bet on to say if you scolding you talk idiom. Okay, I don't even know what this is when I'm running.	1.0
That's why people, you know, I was I was supposed to be a bit anemic. I'm happy I did I record unions memory. This woman was taking care of me and she ain't like three other kids and I was like for something it was before I went to school and like we were running around the house and I ran into the toilet knock myself out. So then like I can't I can't relate to this for the like the next three weeks. I had like a big-ass bubbler head. I can't relate to this not the toilet part but like My older sister went through this. Where is she like another lady took care of her because my parents were working. Yeah. My mom always works out. Yeah my younger sister did that but never me because we lived in the fucking farm. So my dad would always take me with him fun times. Even though now I realized I don't think it was taking care of me more like a child labor John.	1.0

Oh, it's probably only like like five or six okay a day just kidding, but it's like when you take these shots, it's like I really want to make sure I'm feeling really good about myself. So it's like I am like perfectly shaved. I'm spray-tanned. I'm like contoured to the max in the face and that's What makes me feel really good. It's like I feel completely gorgeous in these photos interesting. I don't really know how to Contour my face. So like that's not what my also like.	1.0

Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone and forcing yourself into something that's just not meant to be. Hmm. So I do believe it's up to the person to push themselves in a way where it still feels like overall. There's a positive benefit here, right? Because sometimes exercise does push us and it you don't always feel great and you should push yourself, but if you I truly think if you are tuned into yourself in a in a profound way. You can tell what's an exercise that is like comfortably pushing you to be better and stronger and something that's actually just going to hurt you or is just not right for your body. So again, it's up for each person to decide what what that is. I love that. I really love that.	1.0

But anyway, pick up your bathroom floor next you would clear off the countertop of anything that doesn't belong and also the things that do belong meaning. Maybe there are some lotions on the counter that go in the cabinet underneath the sink, but your toothbrush holder and your toothbrushes Do go there you're going to clear everything off. So some things you're going to put them where they go other things that perpetually belong on the counter. You just going to set them aside.	1.0

I just want to read something that I pulled off your Instagram which I love Yeah, an intuitive eating tip. Okay, guys. Hey Doodles are stocking for us anything deeper than base level that you provide us. Casey will find I might know why I think I should have been a private investigator in my past life. I shagged stalker. Anyways, actually just reviewing the records like you had have to do an assessment, right? Yeah. I'm just reviewing the records they all right. She says order the salad if that's what you want what you're craving. Being in the moment, but don't consistently order the salad because you think you should or you think that's a good choice. Right? So like you're saying if you feel like it in the moment and you want it do it, but don't do it based on. Oh, I have to have a salad, right that's part of the diet. And that's kind of talking about MO is Casey if you know what I mean in the moment, right like you have certain things that in one moment. What are a mosrite a mozar when we talk about kind of the background information that Either increases or decreases the value of a certain reinforcer a Punisher in that moment. What do I mean? Okay. So let's say like my body is in a state of deprivation of having anything healthy in a while. Like I've just been on a at a tailgate all day eating crap in my body. That's the background information, right? So in that moment, that's the mo right like a salad or some things in establishing operation from my body is wanting that right. So that's what I'm going to have right then. But on another day, sometimes I just crave a freaking hamburger to bite into right like that's what I want at the time obviously a vegan one yell never real me moo, but in that moment what you'd still be allowed? Oh my God yells really changed guys Adam. I used to like cook salmon and privacy like I like I like She's gone. Everyone looked at those to make it a JB come to my house tonight and but one thing talking about like demos and what's valuable in that moment. Like one moment. This could be valuable for the next hour something else can and I think of really prime example and tell me if this would be intuitive to me. It seems that way. Yeah. Oh, but so when I initially didn't know what was going on with my hands and I was in hospital and it was a result of not having any circulation my fingers started freezing off and they were like going from Black to whatever it was people would say like what can I bring to her in the hospital? What can I bring? What can I bring in? The only thing I wanted was watermelon and I like watermelon but like in no way is that something like I typically crave or I want or like I need just watermelon and that was the only thing I wanted at the time and like I literally ate like probably like two watermelons a day like just cut up and and you know a few months post like my amputation surgery someone sent me. Me an article from the Harvard Business review or Harvard Business or I don't know my brain is going blank right now, but it was essentially about like the circulation properties of blood circulation properties of watermelon and how like they actually like sometimes recommended as a replacement for Viagra, which I actually take now as a medication three times a day and no I don't have erections because its original use was for blood circulation. But anyways, like my body was telling We got you want watermelon. You want watermelon now, do I crave it? No, but that's all I wanted at the time and I found that so fascinating.	1.0

Um, I remember it was back during the first season when it was episode 9 the scene where Styles pushes Derek are Derek bushes. Stiles up against the door, and I thought that they were going to kiss but they didn't so then I kind of just dropped the whole thing didn't really think anything of it and then in like 2012. I got Tumblr and I saw like a piece of fan art for Styles and Derek and I was like, oh there are other people who thought the same thing that I thought so then I checked the stair tag, and this was back when like there was like three pieces of like fan art and like a few little pose. And then I found out about shipping and fandom and like before that. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what shipping was and like steric was like my first Fick and then I just kind of just stayed in the fandom as if that's the show went on in the guns like season 2 when Jeff was like talking about steric more on Twitter back when he had a Twitter.

It will have all been worth it because you know one time I mean it is it is I guess a rite of passage that I'm sure you know, you've learned in talking to other guys probably your age at some point like it seems like boys want to challenge their father. Yeah, you know, they think they can whoop y'all. I don't know what that is girls only. We go through that necessarily that we may get real smart mouth and other and like I said psychologically right like to mess with our parents and especially our mothers because I don't know if you've been through the phase yet. I know your oldest is from a previous relationship but been through that phase of like seeing, you know, your wife and your daughter. It's like go at it like world domination is at stake.	-1.0

We treated it as more a bony injury. So so we ended up deciding to have we didn't get a scan but we've had Three weeks off running and then we're just gradually trying to introduce a little bit of running now to see how it is. So hoping that is just an early stage bone reaction and and then you can slowly get back into running bit legit like we laugh about it now, but that was quite a frustrating time for you like missing that 5K because luckily sort of reported in one of those earlier podcast like we've had some Ames with your 5K and on the track. It's a really good environment. I meant to do a good 5K time. So it was quite frustrating but I thought like you're dealt with it. Well, how did you feel like you handled it?	-1.0

I'm not sure. I've always thought for a very very long time that actually we have three options right from the current situation. We added also 20 years ago. Either we allow the government is no longer into beings doesn't try to bail out anybody and so on then we get a crisis and then we get actually a deflationary melt all of the whole system. As the first option the second option is you're just trying to inflate your way out of this and of course that's not really a solution but it will just Frank we will just wrecked the economy because you're the sooner or later you're getting very fast into hyperinflation. And the third option is and of very often is neglected. The third option is just to layer more and more regulations of the economy to it's late. But at the same time to eventually sort of Regulation to try to prevent that deflationary policies leads to higher prices leads to Greater redistribution and so on and so you're walking your way into a completely regulated into effect into a totalitarian socialist. And right now I think we're moving on a path of this way of this world now, that's that's a very I'm sorry. It is not very very very positive and in a bright Outlook, but I mean, we definitely need to take this into consideration. I mean, we cannot honestly all of the present situation is very fragile. So we all know so it's very unstable and cannot we cannot remain there. So where will be moving I think they But people who are running monetary policy or running the state the main objective is to stay at the helm a to keep running the country handed over to their friends when they they self themselves as step aside. So they will not consider the deflation or a mountain solution. They want to avoid hyperinflation. So the for them the way to go is more inflation and at the same time Again, I'm a greater control or the economy size. So I was yeah, if you think of something like the plunge protection T to they exist. Yeah, I mean, I mean the central bank doesn't call it the plunge for taxing to you. This is the jargon. Yeah.

Welcome to the construction Brothers podcast. I'm your host Tyler Campbell and with me like he is every week giving me a smirk my brother Eddie Campbell. That was just a smile. That was a smirk its mark means I'm up to something. Well, we got an awesome show for you. Today. We're going to be talking to mr. Tyler / a of f of my Consultants about Mega projects. We were really excited to get to that here. In a moment, but first things first, I'm like to bring something to your attention. No, no, no don't don't don't so it's been cold here in Middle, Georgia. Eddie of you. Have you noticed that it's been a little bit cold? Yeah, give the fact it was like 80 directly before the 29. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed Yeah, so in case you guys don't know we live in Middle, Georgia Middle, Georgia can't make up its mind on whether so we'll go from 80 degrees one day and 30 the next it will just drop overnight. It's absolutely insane. Yeah, actually did that last week it literally did so but here's the thing Florida also got smacked with this little cold front to and there was a little news article that HuffPost put up that I was Giggling at earlier. So some things are falling out of trees and they're not the Coconuts. Are they snakes? They're not snakes. I was hoping there was no not snakes. Again. We passed on that no coconuts and no snakes. They're not monkeys. What are they? So the National Weather Service Office in Miami tweeted don't be surprised. If you see iguanas falling from the trees tonight as lows drop. Up into the 30s and 40s, brr. Yeah, especially if you're an iguana, so it's something that they don't usually talk about and I've heard of this before whenever it gets really cold down in Florida iguanas start falling from the trees because they just they can't handle it. They're not dead. They're just Frozen. Well, they're cold-blooded. Yeah. Yeah, so cold weather is kind of tough on something like that counting that subsists because of the Sun and its heat when that goes away has a hard time. It's true. It's true, especially when in trees I'm going to read on a little bit so iguanas aren't dangerous or aggressive to humans, but the damage seawalls sidewalks and Landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. Actually. I didn't know that did you know that a Guam has dug tunnels? No. That's kind of terrifying that's news to me. It's like a dinosaur digging a tunnel a mini dinosaurs a micro dinosaur building a tunnel it is I wonder if elon's going to like get 200,000 iguanas and like try to get them to dig tunnels under Ela or so. That's how he's gonna get us how he's gonna do it. He's not actually going to use a machine. He's just going to get all of the iguana's he's got a tiny Army of iguanas. To dig his tunnel under Los Angeles. I mean the man's genius secret. That's the secret. What you do is you have to harness them together. So you get to Belt any straps groups of ten together and then he makes this massive circle of iguanas that he just sets underground and they start chopping away does the circle spin I think so like a carousel. Yeah. It's like a vertical Carousel with iguanas. Yeah. He leads them. Buying by using electric heaters. So he basically entices them with a heat source. And so they move towards the heat source. It's science everybody history. It's mr. Tyler Perez going to be proud of this intro I can hear now. Hey, man, you should have done your research before getting interviewed by us. You didn't know you didn't know. I don't know nothing about nothing. But that intro man. We are smart around here at school this week. I would like to introduce a new segment and we're going to call that segment. Shower thoughts buckle up. For those of you that don't know there is a subreddit called our shower thoughts on it. You can scroll through and a lot of people just post their post their shower thoughts on there. And a lot of these are are quite interesting. So I kind of wanted to take some time today and read them to you and I figured we'd all have a nice little chuckle about this and or Break our brains a little bit just because of how awesome these are they deep. Some of them is this like deep thoughts. Let me give you the let me give you the first one on my list. Okay, if your thumb is chopped off you lose your middle finger. Yeah. Okay, I can see how this would be a mind-blowing thing. More people have stood on the moon then on your desk. That's not true. Is it not know how is it not true because more people have stood on my desk. No, it's not. How do you know who stood on your desk? Why are you standing on your desk for what have you stood on your desk? I've never stood on my desk. So how can you make this argument? Because somebody else has who small people though? We're not going there. Why can't I talk about my kids on the show man? I'm gonna he's not. Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, I thought you were going another way with that. But yeah, okay fine. No Tyler. I was not and I would like you to go read the employment posters now because spiders mold every time you think you see a dead spider you might be looking at the skin of a live spider that is now larger than it was before. I did not need to hear that today. No, I know you love spiders. Yeah - there are gallons of saliva traveling through the postal system at any given moment. I have a question. What do you like licking stamps and envelopes? Sometimes they had I don't know how you feel man, really mixed emotions. Yeah, really mixed emotions. Some of them actually taste. Okay, if you think about it, it's kind of got a muted taste. It's not anything earth-shattering. It's not like Gordon Ramsay himself cooked something and slathered like some broth on the outside of the envelope for you to lick. Okay, let me bring this full circle. Okay. Is there a market for envelopes that taste good? I think there is actually there are envelopes out there that tastes good are there. Yeah, I think there's there's why with me yeah, this is too obvious. Yeah. Like popcorn slathered in butter. That's terrible. Here's one for you. All numbers are closer to 0 than they are to Infinity. I just watch Teddy's head explode. Okay. All right here. Oh, okay. Now here's one dentist study the dangers of plaque in order to receive a plaque that says they can remove your plaque. That's a lot of levels of plaque it is it's like plaque exception. How do you feel about flying? I think that it's a good idea. And most of the time I leave it at that I always bleed every time I floss then the lady over at the dentist's office is always like this because you don't floss and I'm like, but I bleed when I flies I'm like so you're telling me that I would build calluses between my teeth and my teeth holes that would it would prevent the bleeding. And your and your teeth Caverns dude. I I I call Shenanigans. I think big floss is out to get us probably is yeah. Yeah. No, this is all just a racket and all the Mr. In it. They're out there trying to sell their Wares trying to sell us string string with mint flavoring on it in some cases. You know what all this time. They could be tied in with the envelopes to the the people that make the tasty envelopes. Because you think about it. It's the same technology. You're applying Taste of paper, you know, like or like string or like textiles you haven't lived though until you got that piece of popcorn stuck in your teeth in the floss comes in for the rescue and saves the day I got used to do that. No, that's your penalty for eating popcorn. I refuse to use no, I will not use floss to dislodge a popcorn brightest popcorn have to have any kind of punitive value attached to it because Because when it comes out you can eat. So you're saving it for later? Yeah gives you it gives you something to do. What do you think of beards for? Well, why do you think I have a beard to save it for later? Obviously. It's crumb catcher. That's what it is. It's your peanut butter and jelly for lunch. By the way, I didn't have peanut butter and jelly belly. Well that's even scarier than what's in my beard. All right. Well, let's let's move this thing along. Let's talk about Tyler / a so he came in and he wanted to discuss mega-projects FMI is really huge in finding reports and collecting information and spreading that out to people Eddie. I feel like this was more Show then mine listening back to it because you had you just nerded out on a lot of these factoids. This is just right in your veins. So I think I think we should just call this one the Eddie show. Haha. Yeah now I still construction Brothers man. No, no, it's the Eddie show. Okay. Yeah, but I think I said like two words and you hear a chuckle from me. All right, that's it. Everybody comment if you like that format and everybody comment if you miss me. Mom that's that's shit. I'm looking at you that's dangerous man. He had me nerding out because I'm I'm curious about what's going on in construction. Mmm, and he's got he's got research to back up the things that he's saying. Yeah, and so when he's coming at us talking about mega-projects talking about market trends talking about what's going on with Our labor shortages, he has resources and knowledge to back that up. And I think that there is going to be a lot of value to this show. Mmm. Maybe not just may not be for absolutely everyone. I think it's going to be intriguing for most. Yeah, and there's a lot of content here that I feel like just great content, but I do see people that are on the front end of construction trying to decide what they're doing. With projects and how they're how they're going about business right here in a lot of value here. One of the things that really stuck out to me back to the labor shortage. He was saying that we lost a lot of that labor back in O8 during the crash. Yeah, they left and they just never came together came back. And so that is something that we're facing now and something that gets a code often is we need labor. I don't know how many times I've read articles in the recent past that say, I mean, Can too are you a human being do you have a pulse? And those are your requirements? Do you know how to get out of bed? Like we're that starved for Laborers. I'm only being a little silly. Yeah, like I have read articles that are really not far off at in construction Publications. And so yeah, I mean talking about that the Scout of be something of interest to people listening if you're in the construction industry and you have to Source labor, I know that's something We experienced here. Yeah, how do we find talented people get them here retain them train them the way we do things and then leave and effective team. Even if you're a labor in you know in the workforce right now, this could be encouraging to you, you know, and maybe you could start looking at things that you do in a different way that hey maybe I can leverage this. Maybe I can leverage these skills that I have to build up a business, too. Fit in to that that missing piece in our industry. Maybe you can digital. Yeah, maybe you can just realize that you are a valuable part of the industry. You are. Yeah and that your commodity it's hard work, but we appreciate everybody out there doing that every single day. Yeah stay at it. Yeah. All right guys, well, we're going to go ahead and move along and we're going to get into our episode with Tyler Gray. All right, Tyler. Thanks for joining us today.	1.0

So hey go to this Garden check out our Discord and have a conversation with us go to our link go to our Discord. Make sure you stay who you are. Because if you don't have the same username, I'll just really who's this girl 2. Yeah, but on Discord, we kind of talked we kind of talked about it on Discord in the sense that like probably my only problem. Like what I've seen of Firestorm actually looks really good and I'm like, okay that looks pretty cool. But there's one key problem about Firestorm and that's that I would have to buy Battlefield 5.	1.0

She is such a soul and I know that like every single person is going to look at this interview and be like another mom saying it's going to get better and everything's going to work out. She's different. She's different like she has been through and the advice of like don't take advice from people that don't that was the best. That was the best thing I've heard because there are so many people in my oh, I'm sure oh my God, there's a lot of people that have input on your life. But but you don't really really like them and really have no idea what you're going through. In your personal life. Yeah, so if they don't know if this is a good quote if they don't know you personally don't take it personal. There. It is. Alright bang. So this is like kind of funny because we just had a like deep discussion and now we're going to talk about sex. So we're all over the place. Yeah. I mean honestly, we just this is a shit storm, but we're doing our best but we these questions are actually kind of amazing and there's also a story that we can share. Yes, that's us Also, it's also just horrifying. All right. So, um, we're not announcing and everybody's in everyone's Anonymous a lot of girlfriends contributed So, yeah, thank you to our girlfriends. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks ladies. So the first question is do colleges actually have sex parties or is that just in the movies? No, at least. I'm not any I know about and I am I probably would not ever want to go to that because that's a little scary. Yeah. No, I mean I've never really heard of that. I've never had the invite. Oh God. Yeah. No, I haven't had an invite. I have heard and sort of maybe seen some weird things but I've never like I think the closest thing to a sex party has been like seeing people in a club like just all touching each other and really having yeah, like literally having sex like, oh my God this greatly. Yeah, so like, okay like that's all but that's not even a sex party. That's all I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really know a little bit more private about my sex life. So saying this is like weird for us to talk about. Yeah, I well I thought it would be we thought it would be funny. So yeah, I think it's hopefully just in movies or if like if you're in a public school Define sex party orgies. Yeah, like I don't really like her but cut in my nose. Yeah. I mean maybe some people do I think if you go I'll ever Arizona or I think it was those big crazy schools. Like we went to Suffolk. I was still in school in Boston. Yeah. I went to school in Vermont and we did not have that experience. No, I think I think that's just in the movies girl. I think that's a little let's all pray together that it's just in the mood. Let's pray. The next question comes from one of my girlfriends and I think that it's just like such an amazing thing so should body count be a topic of discussion in relationship. Oh, I think if somebody asks your body count, they should be prepared to probably not be the happiest because if they're asking their Curious and they're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I mean Yeah, or they just want to know so that they have it against you without saying they want to hold it in you know, but I'm also the type of person I'd ask because I don't care I've asked every not that I've dated a bunch of guys because I haven't but everyone I've pretty much been with. Oh I was asked to I've said how like what's your number because I like especially people I've dated because what am I saying? I've had like one serious boyfriend but with Cody I've asked him and I it's nothing I would ever hold against somebody no. I'm not at all unless if your number is outrageous then that's a little questionable but it's definitely something that just is like I'm just curious like it's not that I'm an insecure person. It's just that I just want to know want to hear how naive I am. This is how it this is how bad well this was also a few years ago. I was still in college my old roommate Grace her and I were like in my bedroom and we were talking one day and she goes what's your number and I literally was like nine seven eight eight five three, and I don't know that's not even mine or telephone number. Yeah, and I started saying My telephone number and she was like no. No, she was like you idiot like your body count and I was like, oh I was like, I don't know. I've never thought of it. I don't know why I don't think of it all that much and I think that's probably just because it's not something that's like a game-changer in any of my relationships because I've never really been with someone who's like slept with hundreds of people saying yeah, but that's that and if someone but I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be interested. I would not be interested. Yeah like I'd be like, okay. Well, obviously If it's if it's over, I'm not going to say like what my number is or like what not my number but what like my ideal number and a partner is but if it's over a certain amount then gotta go because like that's sorry. Yeah. I'm like flexible about stuff like that. Like I know that a lot of people our age like sleep around and experiment and do not like different things. Yeah. So that's never bothered me. We have one question or not. Really a question. It's actually a story from one of our girlfriends. And shoot I was looking through. Okay. Here's Tiffany's. Well, that's not even her real name. So I guess it's fine. Oh God is a lot of Tiffany's there's a lot of Tiffany's in this world. Okay, so shout out to this bitch.	1.0
Higher that that is the entire problem with Keynesian economics that the whole metaphor is incorrect because the economy is not a machine the economy is as exactly and that of course, there's cause what back to the enlightenment it's the French and that item and are yes a guy like good immensely and he wrote this book man-machine my you haven't really that all the allotment people that this conviction that really most people will just some sort of rabbits. There. They are. Very few very enlightened people Voltaire said there's something to this effect only one one of two percent probably a rather one percent of human beings are truly human beings all others are just some sort of Rapids and so you can program them as you wish and you just need to fix the loss in this that way. We have a program of social engineering and Keynes was just continue like this you did it with the economics Express.

I think this really is not that bad but things could get much worse and that helps me. Yeah, but I also Tell myself a lot if I'm starting to feel crap, and I just want it to end.

I think it's hard for me to say. Terms of buying a whole furniture package because they're I don't imagine they would be many people out there who would have no furniture to begin with maybe they just want to replace their lounge or their coffee table. That's why I think accessories are a lot easier to replace in a room as opposed to replacing your whole bed and bedside tables but also from where I'm coming from because I'm a regional person that shipping for me. He is very expensive. So I don't offer shipping for my bedroom packages. You would need to be a local to pick them up because shipping is just too expensive. I think probably in the cities the bedroom packages would probably work and be a bit more in demand. But yeah, it's hard. It's hard for me to say.	-1.0

I wish I could remember I think he went I know he went a couple three times anyway in a bareback riding and then it only went twice in a bronx and the first year he went in the Bronx actually feeling Crawley one second and on him in The Eliminator pin that he wanted second that one round that one night and then then he went last this last night and 18, but he went and teen again, but then it came out that and was Zeke's arson and I think of zika gone anyway, and I didn't even got in flank and they jumped off I think and got to reroute a river. But but he so it came out backwards. And so it was kind of a mess that you're in 17 and then they didn't he didn't go back and this year and 18. He still box really? Well, I'm not I'm I'm not trying to say that, you know, like he's killed us really really hard. He just didn't go last year in you guys know how that goes some years. They need they need more of one kind and another and you know, this is how it goes. He just didn't get chosen last year, but he still as good as he was these this these people I'm going to mention here their long ways from you, but you probably you may you may know this the answer to what I'm going to say to correct me but to go with what you're saying Thor and some good friends of mine that live over there by you the the gays that horse is salt. They he went to the finals of bunching in the bareback riding and I'd never seen him in the bronc Ridin till this year. Did he go in the bronc riding him this year to the final? You know II could look but I don't recall seeing assault there, but I know him he's that Buckskin gilding. You're like, he's a good horse. Yeah, I don't know I could you know what I can look real quick cuz I think I have the NFR left right here in the go in the old. I remember seeing them. They took him to I think it was luck in in in the Bronx grab your maybe Amarillo and I was I had to watch that video a couple of times thinking is that the Assault that I think it is. Yeah, yeah, and and and and he's probably the same the same. Same scenario as I was talking about with Capone, you know, he's been a good bear back for a long time. But if they start covering a little ground and stuff.	-1.0
Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's a lot of people's like I I definitely I think the first time I technically heard of it. Clean prints gaming and he's he talked about it. And he was like, you know, oh, hey, here's the secret project. I think even had the name of that Apex Legends. I don't know if like, I don't know if he knew that it was the real name or whatever. Like I don't know what his sources are but like he was actually talking about the fact that it was going to be a battle or who's going to be a battle royale that it wasn't going to be in the TitanFall Universe. I don't think he said anything about classes. So there was a few things that he got wrong, but that was actually the first time I ever heard of it and I'm like Well, that's kind of cool. I mean, I like a lot of people, you know, love Titanfall 2 and it came out and yeah, it was very much. It was very much the same thing you were saying just like well dang it, you know every they were put to they were put to death by EA and so for for it to kind of turn around into this was probably one of the most amazing things. I mean the little a lot of people kind of already talked about it, but it's just the fact that is like hey, you know this game that we made well, it's already And it's like wait. What?	1.0

So it's basically we do this these deep visualization almost hypnotic exercises that take me to you know, certain memories. It's traumas and just limiting beliefs and things of that. Nature and we cleared it. You're going to notice that all why I've noticed that all these negative emotions. These stuck traumas are all tied to limiting beliefs without limiting beliefs.

Okay, the battle pass happened and we're playing and he's just like, oh my God, everybody's got so much better at everyone same spot on like he can keep up with Sometimes like I've had some bad days. I'm like, you know, what dude I just gotta like a log off anymore and I'm gonna kill the vibe for this party, but it's funny that you brought up the octane jump pad to because I'm so happy that you got this cool trick shot like in the air kill someone I tried doing that and my buddy throws down jump pad and the squad is all like on the other side of this house that we needed to get over and he throws it down he Is he can't he knocks someone like I'm gonna do the same thing.

It's fucking nuts. It's so good. Cause all the cutscenes and the camera the camera eat like the action camera like one of the most underrated aspects like in Smash Bros. Melee, but they made a lot of clones one thing that was brought up. That was like this really kind of salient point from one of my viewers was just that it's the camera secretly that makes the game so much fun. Like it's not it's like it feels like someone's holding it and following you around and that like kind of like that feeling that it's like more lives at helped so much the camera and this game is so good when they switch from cutscenes to like when you're in different environments if it's like rumbly or whatever. It's such a good camera. So smooth always where you need it to be it's never annoying to deal with with and even though there's like a vertical layers to the map. You don't have to like look you don't like look up too hard. Yeah someone it's so it's so well done. It feels like the whole thing feels extremely linear, but then there's so much to explore so I it's just like got everything so far. Yeah. It's only thing that would fuck it up for me is not enough boss fights or Too Short at this point because Titanfall 2 is really short, right?	-1.0
Yeah, I think so and I think that's where what like your strong suit is like like you get story like you have all sorts of great ideas and where your story sounds really comes out is in Your visuals like I you know when I give you a signal we're going to shoot and I have the storyboard and I'm like, I think it's going to look something like this like you're interested like okay, where are these characters heads out where they're doing and you shape your lighting and angles and stuff kind of around that like whatever. I might not have already thought about that's where you jump in. You're like, I want to have, you know a dark back here because you know Duality or whatever, you know, and like that's that's a, you know, a huge part of the storytelling as well as well as the place where you Excel that I do pretty much nothing with is, you know, Partnerships with Brands stuff like that you're able to I mean, it's at the moment. We're still working on our funding but at the moment, it seems like the majority of its going to come from you being able to talk to these Brands they like hey, here's how making this movie can help you guys out and exchange for you to give a little bit of money to actually make it. Yeah and like so far it's looking like we're gonna get a bit of money out of that and that's something that I would not be able to like, that's not I'm not I don't really create content for Brands other than it might like my day job, but I don't sell that content to help make it.	1.0

I would describe it as I want to say lifestyle, even though I don't love that term. It's just a new mentality or a new approach to being in your body, you know, so I have also seen as intuitive eating has become friend here, like people advocating intuitive eating as like the diet where you don't diet and that's so counterproductive to the point of being because it's not a diet and in fact, you cannot practice intuitive eating while also trying to control or intentionally lose weight because as long as you're doing that as long as you are if you can't do it with Weight Watchers, for example, no, Like you like even though they say with Weight Watchers, you could eat whatever you want, but I'll keep ya as long as you're following externalized rules about what you should be eating and tracking your numbers and and having fear around going past a certain point. You'll never be able to actually tune into your body to tell you how much food you really need to feel satisfied. So intuitive eating separates out weight from your health and and really believe that you can be Healthy and you can focus on just practicing Health behaviors without feeling the need to control your weight and that your weight actually is not indicative of your health status.	-1.0

So clean out that refrigerator if you have time wiping down walls. Maybe you have a sliding glass door.

So stop with that. Yeah, but like, of course, I knew like that there were hypocrisies about Among the like Christian Community and so I don't want anyone to ever think like that's why like I left because I've always granted like there are you know, good people and bad people in every community and every group, you know, and so so I never really liked of course things could be hurtful but like that never caused me to then think like, oh, well God must not be true because all these Christians are hypocritical. Like it was never that way of thinking and I know it's hard for some people to understand like one of my videos recently got promoted by YouTube and it's actually really annoying because I have all of these Christians who are just so hateful like leaving so many nasty comments. I'm just like why are you liked so many people try to say like like not all Christians are bad, but like when 99% of the people are so I mean and then you get like one nice one and it's like okay obviously like something needs to change here, but they were all saying like you were never a real Christian. You must have never been saved like that's just impossible because and I feel like it's a defense mechanism where it's like if I was a real Christian and then left like what does that say about their belief system, you know, absolutely I think it's very fear and that's like it's so much projection and that's why you know,	-1.0

Usually not so I will take one of those free rubber bands that I got off the celery and put that around the rice bag or the bean bag after I use after I use some of it because everybody knows it's cheaper to get you know, big bag of pinto beans or big bag of white rice, but I still keep those in the Box just kind of out of habit. That's where I keep things that have been open just as a general rule. So those are just some ideas.	1.0
That was so so again my take on it from all the features that I end up liking the majority of the songs. He clearly had the best out of the Three Amigos. I'm gonna give him a 3. I'ma get my three just just based off of off of that along because I really thought especially after the delay the first delay. I was like man, I don't know about this. Like, what is he really trying to do was he trying to save face what else is really going on with it? But I think all in all once it finally came out. I thought they did was a pretty a pretty decent album and I enjoyed it for the most part for what it is the production to I forgot to mention. Yeah production will definitely good for ducks with Delphine. Good night. And obviously that would me that's you know, my biggest thing. I look at the reduction first and then like at the features on there. I'm seeing how you mesh well with the features and then you know, the lyrics come out through for me. So again, I enjoy it down man. I definitely do it. So I'm gonna give it a three. So that's our takes on it. Also Father for I I give it a 3 flight gives a two and a half. So there you go man as I'm review. Let's get to the song of the week. Now. I have to make two chains again because I don't know if you got a chance to listen to a rapper go to the league yet, but there was a particular song and let me not mess this up here give you the proper name of the song, but it had Ariana Grande on it. And it's only called rude earlier. Yeah, it's called rule the world and it had a Camry Camry sample here. I was like, whoa. I said I know this sucks. I said, what is this? I said oh, oh no, I feel like I told everybody on Twitter. I said are we gonna grind a doing uh doing a remix of why don't we fall in love and what I'm going home? He's like nah, he's I always felt that I was like, yo I said give it a chance man. Give it a chance. I'll legs actually a good song where you like. Nah, you like I'm good. But it just inspired me to like go back and listen to the Emery. So I want to we fall in love and when she came out. Oh man, I forgot like how hot she was fam. Like this song was fucking dope and shit. So I would have listened. I was like yo, this song was bumping yo, they beat was was dope as hell. So this is going to be my song for the week and that was inspiration from the from the sample remix for a router word vagina Grande en change to chase album. So Amory, why don't we fall in love? This came out in 2002 people 2002 to memory did take a long break, but she did apparently come back. I haven't even get channels in that album. Do I ain't even gonna lie, but but you did come back and start making music again, but when we first came out man, she had a bus. She definitely had a bus. So I respected that and this was definitely one of my favorite songs from her. Why don't we fall in love the find Marie Van de saint-fond is that stain? Wait find is that they I death he had a crush on her face that want that one thing video, bro.	1.0
Right and I felt like oh my gosh, I no longer have this negative burden, right? So that was cool. And then so I and then in 2016 as many of you know, I had that deep experience where so this is a few months later after that. I had this deep experience where I became president.

These couples was they talked about having clear boundaries. And so for all of you out there listening. I'm going to give a little bit of homework here, but you should even if you're if you're in a relationship if you're not in a relationship, especially if you're not yet in a relationship, but you should write down clear boundaries and you should have them prepped out before we're on where if you start dating someone that you can have a sit down and say listen, this is the boundaries that I'm committed to when I spoke to this first couple they said men and the The wife said it was so good for me. I have such trust in him because he sat down he had his boundaries. She had her boundaries. They kind of came to a consensus and they said will never cross there someone if we feel like it's getting to be too much someone's going to yell and they and I asked him I said, what would you do differently? Is there anything you would change and they said honestly we didn't and that's really the fruit. You don't want to leave it until you're in a compromised situation to exercise self-control. That's when it's too far. The Bible says to make no. Vision for the flesh. If you find yourself in a position where things are being compromised. You've actually made an allowance in your boundaries. Your boundaries should be that you're not in a compromised position and not only that but like Krista said to avoid the appearance of evil you doing that. I mean there's there's coffee drinks that I can't take pictures of and post on my Instagram story because like Nitro coffee, it looks like beer right and so I drink Nitro coffee but almost drink it in secret because it's like I can't it's coffee. I don't have any taste for alcohol. Never touch alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. It's not even if it's in and if it's in my food if I read it on a on a restaurant menu, I don't order that thing because there's alcohol in it, right? That's how that's how strict I am with myself on that. But but I won't take pictures of it because people all of a sudden think what even if it's one out of 200 who doesn't know that I'm in the craft coffee and love good coffee and thinks I've got I'm drinking alcohol. I just won't let it happen. So avoiding. Yeah if it causes one.	-1.0

Now as we are into round three just waiting on a few of the simulation to go. Well. Luckily. I have it on the fast timing so that will move fairly fairly well, And now grimby up at pick 75 names that came off since then notable names Daniel Jones went to Washington to do quarterback Hollywood Brown goes to the Panthers Chase winter, which breaks Jacobs hard everywhere. He goes to the Dolphins Dexter Lawrence to the Browns Charles omena Hue from Texas to the Vikings Kelvin Harmon to the Steelers Michael Dieter first Badger off.

Right and it's that's naive Tay that you have that when you're that young that I think protects you from the realities of the entertainment business now personally, I always thought we was making fire because of what the movie was. I was like yo, this is like our life, you know what I mean? Like I could relate so much to the film that I felt like I would go see this, you know, but then you know, this is me saying it in hindsight, but you just there's so many variables that come into you know, the filmmaking process the timing the market Yada, yada yada, but personally I always felt it was going to be fired. You know what I mean? Because I was a part of the process again. I'm on set with pot we doing this scene. We doing that scene and storylines going here going there. I thought it was dope.	1.0
We we do see though that Fang shows up good boy Fang and he's brainwashed. Yeah, he's he's definitely a nice. Yeah, he's in he's in deep, but we in the episode with with Kevin and Betty and Charles where Kevin does say that he'll tell them. But given the fake information and find out where the farm is located. It looks like they're located at some Hotel on the other side of the maple Barons right there. Hold up of the bunch of arms and they're ready to make a stand. Yeah, so I guess I'm gonna have to go by what Kevin saying especially what we saw in a previous next week, right?	1.0
I have an approach sometimes it works is a good motivator. If I'm out is really struggling to define the energy to get out the door. I'll find a really good audio book or a really good point cast and I'll say I'm only allowed to listen to it when I run over as the only done and so that way I go are really one of us to that podcast. I better go for a run and then it gets me out the door and then once I've started yeah, yeah getting started is the hardest part half the time, you know, so. But yeah, but I mean it's yeah, it's really live in a good time. It enlightens time having all these like so many entertainment choices when they're out running and I think but the same time it is good just to tune in on itself. Like we're sort of going in and out of our own mind here this conversation like what but I think whatever works best, you know, like yeah, I agree.	1.0

Thanks very much indeed. Line up by now that was fascinating absolutely loved it. So interesting really really interesting just before we came on air you were mentioning the House of Commons. Yeah, the I think we must be watching this. I forget the Channel's name because it was either the BBC News Channel or BBC Parliament and possibly both because we ended up switching off at about 10 o'clock in the evening and we started watching roughly lunchtime and I I tuned in to catch boris's statement returning from New York after the Supreme Court ruling and actually it was almost one of those entertaining afternoons of my things in my life. So for anyone asked to see me, you must watch if it's not the full show that at least the highlights of Jeffrey cocks the Attorney General because it was absolutely a PST A Pas du tout pas de resistance. Unbelievably full-blown that the whole works in the guys going to this is amazing roaring baritone anyway, but he just he just blew blew the opposition away. I think there were there were heavy expectations coming into yesterday because we're recording this on Thursday the 26th 26th of September. So it's a few days just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the Pierogi of Parliament and there's an expectation coming. Into the commons that know that they were going to Duff up the attorney general and follow up by duffing up Boris and my god did those expectations get reversed very very quickly. So first the Jeffrey Cox in this is fantastic and hilarious and then you have you know, the man himself. So Boris came in and basically just gave no quarter and there's a very appreciate what Dido just said about social media. He's absolutely right, but if you do have the To engage with say Twitter. There is a very special pleasure that can come with engaging with Twitter while simultaneously watching a big event and the Parliamentary session was a big event. So it's almost that's that's what it's designed. Almost all yeah always had become as a mixture of Theater Grand guignol black comedy. I don't know how to describe it. I'll be I'll be looking at grand grand. What does that thing? I couldn't tell you I decided to extend impressive but the Macabre so I've always interpreted, but I don't You know the full definition Barack possibly. I'm just starting at mindless French words now either. What's I don't know what's happening and being taken over by Spirit of Madness. But Boris launches at there was no Contrition. No apology was General Gregory an to the power of infinity and during during the proceedings. Basically, he's worked out perfectly how to be the world's most successful troll on the back of perhaps the success of gone. From so he started using the phrase surrender Bill about the Hilary Benn act which is basically means to be can't can't leave without a deal and every time he used the term surrender Bill the opposition benches would just get would just get more and more Angry. So course you would then continue to use the phrase surrender bills that why you change your Twitter hand. So I've changed my Twitter handle to surrender a bill cousin of surrender bill, but last night I was just having the funniest. Time of it and then I thought okay. Let's really go for it. And I said could everybody please stop using the word surrender Bill hashtag surrender Bill and then I think followed up with the first rule of surrender bill is due not mentions do not talk about surrender Bill. The second rule of surrender will is do not talk about surrender Bill and those have been my most popular tweets ever. So everyone has been filed in and it was extraordinarily funny how that must is so much fun. But on honest on a slightly more sobering note D. The one thing that Also kind of a last night was I think was Barry Sherman and some woman who is named. I don't even want to remember from the Labour party the amount of hostility rage blind rage real hateful rage that came back up Boris is it was a sight to believe and for what? It's worth. I'm and I'm clearly on one side of debate among arm the pro breaks it side but it struck me that I think labor and the lib Dems have called the public mood a hundred percent wrong on this so when they're saying own, Where the language is in temperate and in moderate and all the rest of it? I think they're no because what Boris was doing yesterday was he was giving a like a sort of a Channel of venting for those of us those Seventeen point four million people who basically felt completely cheesed off the last three and a bit years and he's actually no lightning rod for the for the opposition but an opportunity for those those sitting there not a trivial number of people who frankly have felt cheated and betrayed and he's now he's now just Taken the taken the fight to Parliament in those small way. I know anything can happen. But what do you what do you think the next steps are II couldn't even begin to say because I mean, I'm no expert in Parliament procedure and there's been but apparently neither. Does anybody else this writing the laws now as they go on I saw a headline saying that Boris had lied to the queen or something is that these terms are very nuanced. So I'm again stress. I'm no expert but my take on it is that at Boris had perfectly Sound Advice perfectly credible advice from his legal people including the Attorney General to do what he did your ocean to the mechanics as that basically said dismissing Parliament to then reinstating it the later date and that was all deemed to be sufficiently legal for him to go ahead and meet the queen and then the Supreme Court Bear in mind that also a number of very high-profile local British Justice. People also approved it and then the Supreme Court 11 to nothing decided that it was it was technically unlawful. But I think is Boris himself said what's really happened is that the legal system has been brought in it to a pine on these it has no matter talking about it has nothing to do with politics. This is the last thing you really want to happen in terms of the UK the British constitution. It is not for the courts to decide what parliamentary procedure ought to be. Like it's none of their business and you know, because we've got hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent to draw upon and people are now that that is exactly what gido is talking about in relation to the elites. Now when the elites had cornered they will do absolutely anything to you know to ensure that they win. Well, I think in this case this is this is a classic example of a Battle Royal where neither side is backing down, but the difference is know that there was a simple majority the leave And that simple majority a total of 17 and a half million people have been ignored for us three years. So no surprise that they're angry that I'm angry. And so there's a phrase that John Lanchester used it in one of his pieces a while back guy who writes for London of your books that somebody going to quote ridiculous Basil's 40-ish lengths unquote to achieve something and that's what the remain cap of done. So they're driving a coach and horses through historical precedent through law. You're through normal parliamentary life through everything just to overturn a perfectly legitimate vote. It's quite sickening. Really. Are you have some I know some people who are remain has and I get I detect that they are starting to get weary with it as well. You know Whitney nothing. Yeah, if we're not careful something get killed. Well, I say that in all sincerity. I don't mean it to have her that wanted to happen. But if trust me when you see the footage of certain labor and peas just that does blind with Fury just lashing out at Boris is deeply unsettling. Well, we can still get there. Can we is that particular YouTube and I've had some this morning on some more happy topics. I just want to say a couple of shout. Shouts first of all to Dixie Deville on YouTube.

So score was 1:1 towards the end of the first half and Josh something happened in the box there didn't look like it was a ton of contact, but you went down and were down for a while with an injury and I can tell you standing next to You your parents and other people on the sidelines there were some worried people over on the sidelines both one for your health. But also then if you couldn't return that would be a big loss for the team can tell us about what happened there. And yeah, so basically like this kid earlier on the game he went for like a slide tackle and that's when I went down on my shoulder. Like that's when it started to hurt a lot and then later on another kid like hit me in the shoulder and that's when I went down in the box. So so you set off for the rest of the Half did come back in the second half and then I don't know 15 minutes, maybe into the second half you took a shot from just outside the box that the fans over on our side line were ready to cheer and explode in excitement and then it hit the crossbar. So what were you thinking on that chat do you think was going in? I thought I was going to go in because I put like I hit a knuckleball and it was moving and the keeper couldn't do much. I felt bad. Yeah, I was gonna ask you. What was your feeling when it crossbar pretty bad? Yeah. Thankfully we were able to still maintain our composure there and then Auggie you got a penalty kick late in the game there then end up being the game-winner. There were some Chestertown fans and the calvary players and some of their fans to kind of yelling at the keeper trying to give them instructions as to which way you were going to go. Did you hear them at all? What were you thinking when you stepped up to the Penalty spot there?	0.0

It has given me everything. I know like I'm just so thankful. I stayed in it for so long because he gave me the technique it showed me how to connect my body properly because everything is done from your Center in Ballroom. All the strength comes from your legs and your Center and hopefully it resonates through your face and through your upper body, you know, so it gave me definitely that strength and connections inside my body. So when I do something that's outside Ballroom, I still feel like I'm able to be connected and look kind of okay fish but it definitely gave me discipline. So on it's good to plan and my body and going through pain, you know and and discomfort and sometimes when you feel like wow, I feel so good today and you look at the video like what is that bad and then like some competitions I walk off the floor and I'm like how like that was.

Yeah, I think in the last game you guys had a lot of turnovers and I think if you guys can minimize the turnovers, I think you guys will be. All right. I think it's going to be a different team that they're facing and they they're not ready. I don't know if they're ready for this this live over Hamlin pod 540 because this team has seemed to come alive in the last second half of the season. People are comparing this team to the 1994 Hamlin's team. How does that make you feel? Because with that team being that what that team making it to the state semifinals as well. People are comparing those two teams. Does that how does that make you feel to think? They're comparing us to that t that same team?	1.0

Um, it was probably I feel like the one that was angry was when I was like livid at the show, which was after the still Leah episode and I can house When doused Eric wasn't going to happen and all of this craziness was happening was there is what was it called? Um, so it was the collective that Teen Wolf People we're going to create like their own Tumblr called the collective and they were going to upload like you could upload pictures of fan art and whatever and it was so obvious like they were only going to include hetero Actual fan art like they weren't going to allow / shipping and it was just a way for them to like control their fandom like the Teen Wolf and um, and I got a message from somebody who like I can't reveal who they are, but they worked with like this system. It was like listen you have influence amongst the Teen Wolf and mm based on like how popular you are and you have a voice if you speak out. Out against this it will like stop the Teen Wolf people from trying to do whatever it is that they're doing and so they were like you can write a post and just like tell the fandom don't you know mess with this Collective crab don't you know join this? Yes, just you know a way for them to control the fandom and then I like I've looked at like their terms of service or whatever and it was like if you upload a piece of fan art, they You can complete control of that own it own it to like do whatever it is that they want to do with it. So I just formulated this giant post and then I think I uploaded like I posted it before the collective even dropped. So like it was before like it got announced that it was gonna be like into like for like usage. So I uploaded it and people just went crazy over it saying I'm not using this. This is crap blah blah blah and then the piece ER guy who worked at the time for the Teen Wolf PR like ranted on it and like sub tweeted me and he said he said something like like I hate when people who don't know what they're talking about come in and ruin something that you've been working on for like months and I'm like, well, sorry, we all know who that guy was and he still trash to this day.	-1.0

We agree and I'm so excited for this draft because I don't foresee any more big move from the Packers prior to the draft. I just don't think they have the ammo that they're willing to part with and then also the financial flexibility is a little bit less now that they've kind of, you know revamp the defense through free agency, which is honestly is all going according to my perfect plan for the Packers offseason. And that was to supplement the defense with veteran free agents and then go into the draft and address the off. That's with depth offensive pieces. So I'm very excited for good cuz he can do anything he wants to do, you know, he's going to have to work with patent and the floor to make these decisions and get get this team back to their Championship status.	1.0
You can't organize clutter. There might be some junk down there that you just never use. We really only need so many products. So it's good to simplify and admit to yourself when a product just didn't work out and you're not using it anymore and just don't buy it again, but you don't need to keep it for three or four years and then you know justify throwing it away at that point by how old it is. If you're not going to use it. Maybe pass it on to a friend or family member or just toss it depending on what it is.	-1.0

Wait, well, the funny thing is in the periphery you have I mean everywhere you have the same type of problem Google department and greater region inequality. Right? But in the periphery these problems are stronger, especially the redistribution problem at the if you look at people initially the upper class in Italy. There is a greater difference between them and the lower classes in in Germany. Hmm. Or in Spain or Portugal and so on so probably all right. The problems should explode in the periphery and there's an exploding for free as you know that Greece Spain is very particular. I'm very iterative of Spain right there all the way through this crisis. There is a lot of coverage but then the society it's definitely not something they literally went through things that the Greeks for instance did not would not tolerate the silent could say the same for our the Irish.	-1.0

Okay, so that's all so far this year. I don't have any other events. No, but then I just put just keep doing it and I there yesterday that bag thing again. That's just so I could see me. Oh well as to be done, I'm seriously wondering about taking no drop bags as time. It'll be a first But I'm seriously considering just whatever I carried from this top 400 case. That's it. You could easily do that. The checkpoints are so-called there. I just like to quite often. I don't use anything in my job. There's I just like to have them there. I figure if I don't need it, it's great. But at least it's there in case I do I feel the cold as well. So always have extra warm clothes in my drop bags. I hate being cold. I really suffered in the cold before during events. And yeah.	-1.0
So anything kind of what you're saying to you like if you're Having you know a lot of anxiety and you're just not feeling great. I kind of like to say you have to give yourself a fighting chance. So I mean I noticed when I'm eating really poorly and I'm not working out and I'm just like I guess what's one more pint of ice cream and that's me and hurt me and Fountain Coke. Yeah, like you just you just feel like gross and I think I kind of made the decision last week and then of course, I got my wisdom teeth out this week. So I've kind of been knocked down but um, I'm Like you know what? Okay, I I'm probably never going to be the same size. I was before I had kids and that's fine. And but I need to give myself the best chance that I can so I'm going to drink water. I'm going to exercise even if like 30 minutes. And so last year I did an Ironman Triathlon, which released 1.2 miles Swim 56-mile Bike and then a half marathon. So for me to sit here and go. Oh, I'm going to walk for 30 minutes. It's like kind of like a In the face to myself because it's like are you kidding me right now? Like you just did this a tower of n but that's what I can do right now. And so that's what I'm going to do. And those little habits are going to build on top of each other and then you're going to get stronger and grow and yeah, and so I think part of it too is you have to give yourself the best possible shot that you can but that kind of brings up like self-sabotage. I know I do that. I'm so good at that where it's like, you know, I'll do a way. Weight loss challenge or something and I'll get so close, but I'm like, I'm not going to make it so I'm just gonna gain ten pounds anyways, and like why do I do that?	1.0
No, I'd like our thing. I really like and and spoiler alert.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
No, but I also I mean guys who are two months from free agency and don't have much trade value. I don't put that on them. I will say the one other one that made you scratch your head at least was last year with trading ideas because I don't think people like that but that wasn't like especially at the time because people didn't really know about Jack Bauer's and he was a top under Prospect like that wasn't what I don't I cannot think of an example ample where they made a trade and it was like, oh my God, they get host. What are they doing? Like you usually have a pretty good feeling about the deal at the moment and it's going to be interesting because like the Dodgers of their their roster and their farm system are loaded. There's so much opportunity, but I don't know it's going to be if they don't include Lux. Is there a way for fans to be no?	-1.0
Yeah. So for to give you a little back story I was a Bull rider not a very good one. I wrote both, you know through high school and college and instead started and I guess I bought my Pro card in 96 anyway, and I rode around and got on lot of balls on the west coast. What it what had happened is I do to getting beat up and Andrew and stuff. I kind of had to give it up yum. I was only 25 or 24 when I quit But I threw getting on a lot of bulls out here on the West Coast. I became friends with Don Kish and getting on his balls all the time and go to go into their rodeos when I got beat up real good. The last time I guess 99 there. I he he called me when I was in the hospital and get offered me a job to come out and weld for it. Well, I was beat up and like I said, he beat up enough to where I can. I couldn't do too much like couldn't lift too much or do too much buddy buddy called and we had been like I said friends before need any dawn said would you like to come home and and weld for me? I'm trying to build this feed lots of these bulls. And and all I had to do is set in well, you guys are probably familiar with putting up pipe and cable fins. And and so I just had to set there and weld them the Milliron on the post to run the cable through and so on that that winter I came or well, I got hurt at Fort Worth. So it was about this time of the year anyway, and that came home and welded for dog. Well, anyway, it evolved into going to work for he and John crowning and and I work for the rodeo company therefore started in 99 and started, you know, discontinued helping Dawn with bulls and then really started getting involved with the horse part of it. You know while working for the rodeo company and then No.5 John offered me an opportunity to buy into the company and by the horses from the company which Saudi I did definitely at the time they they provided the horses and Don had two bullets on the ground. Right? Right. That's exactly right. So John own on the horses and then Dawn on the Bulls and then John also on the time of in cattle. I guess. That's anyway. and so through working around there for four or five years there and I started flanking the horses I guess and probably like oh three and then again just got an opportunity there and bought the horses and oh five and and then kind of well, I don't want this to sound wrong. But you know the horse program when I bought it and I'll five it was it was struggling, you know, there was I think there was a couple or three maybe horses going to the final and and and not a real real and I don't want this to come across like I'm saying anything derogatory. I'm not I'm not I'm just kind of trying to lay out the facts the breeding program. For the horses wasn't real organized. You know, there was kind of not sure what calls were out of what two mares. You know, there was some paperwork loss. You know, it's kind of a oh, yeah Club not a real not a real organized situation and not hey and not to say that I don't feel have some hiccups here and there today. I'm just saying, you know five it was in there was a lot of I did all the information wasn't there. But anyway, So then what I did is, you know first thing I did when after buying the horses sorted up the mayor's kind of got the you know, the mayor's that I thought were the best Mayors and certainly as we all know if you raise bucking stock you the ones you think that are the best at the you know, your first year or two into it, maybe they're not the best and and and then the one that you're that you don't breed all the sudden, you know later on you wished you kick yourself in the butt and think gosh. should have been breeding them are you know, she she was at first maybe wasn't the shiniest one in the herd, but you know, they stay hooked and they stay you know, they just stay solid and today that's the one thing I've learned now being, you know, whatever 13 years 14 years into this but one thing I have learned is the ones that are solid and consistent for me the mayor's that do that seem to be the ones that raised the better horses the that they've The Bucks in them. They're just they maybe aren't the most talented but they give it to you every time they might only be in 1819 pointer. But if they do that out of her time, that's probably in my experience that's you know, only 13 14 years into this pretty Limited in the horse industry because you know, you think of them other guys, I was talking about earlier. Oh, yeah, you guys that there's there's like guys like a cork. Oh they've been doing this 50 50 years, you know, so so when I talk about 13 or 14 Teen years. I might my experience is a little bit limited compared to those guys obviously, but in my limited amount of time here going back to what I thought the solemn are the ones that just give it to you what they what they can every time and and do something every time 1819 Point hoppers for me. Those have been the ones that have been the best moms, you know, and I don't know why that is. I wish I had a magic ball to look into and figure out why that is but But you know the the the ones that jump out there and just make your mouth water rank as hell one time. And then the next time maybe aren't as shiny. They the consistency it for whatever reason that that genetic trait of consistency doesn't doesn't carry on to their you know, their Colts have that same enemy. You know what they're just not consistent in any way so that send the Colts out of those.	-1.0

Wild and blue? Yeah. Yeah. She's been every year since so I actually bought her from the guy here and right here outside of town a friend of mine named Chuck Norris. He raised he raised his bucking horses and does some high school college and it's Amateur rodeos and has a brief program himself and and I actually bought two members from him and I'm kind of think that year. I bought those murder. I'm gonna say I think I bought those mares from him and like, oh, wait right in there and and I bought wild and blue who herself, you know bucks bucks. Obviously really? Well, she'd been to the NF are all these years and then there was another mare that came with her and her name was His Indian summer. Well Indian summer, she's just an okay Bronk. But remember when I was talking about that consistency of being really solid she oh one of those kind she's solid. She's like a 1920 pointer every time and she her oldest cult I have is a bronc named Indian burn and I took him we've taken him to the finals the last two years. He went as a four-year-old and five-year-old. So and And I know you're playing with fire taking a four-year-old to the National Finals. But but he's just that good and anyway, so that that purchase worked out pretty good for us by an electric bears from Chuck. So, you know, we got a boy, you know a really good mare that produces Colton and one that bucks really well herself. So yeah, that's about what they sometimes it hits like that. Now I've got other stories I could tell you that didn't hit very good that one did so so kind of transition into the to the Bulls	1.0

I've managed to beat my body into submission, but it does what it's told but I've been I might not have been running Ultras went. 13 years or whatever, but I've been still running for a long time and I think that counts for something and I do strength training as well. Which for me everyone's different. So a lot of others don't do it and they seem to get by fine, but strength training really works for me and it helps me with my endurance. Maybe I am a bit Lucky in a way that I can recover quickly, but I tend to think not I don't think it's love. I think it's just persistence and just at the cumulative effect of Many years ago breathing. Yeah, I'm lucky. I don't really get major injuries. I had had hip adductor tendonitis in the past.

This I mean in every city everybody will come across the same thing. I'm sure but like we've found over the last couple of years. It's certainly come a long way in terms of the number of agents who are now styling more than they don't. Whereas along when we started we certainly saw a lot of agents who were you know, the number of times I heard all we don't need that to sell a house, you know, I'll sell the house myself.

Food part way through the game part of me does want to try out the new Firestorm for Battlefield because I do kind of want to see like, how are they going to how are they going to handle Vehicles? Because even though like the high-tier like armored vehicles, you have to go to like a specific spot on the map and then you have to work together. And if you work together from the way it sounds is that if you work together, you get the doors open faster and therefore you can get inside. But I would like to definitely see how they do it because if they can figure it out and then you know, obviously it's ETA. So like if they can figure it out and then maybe Titanfall kind of, you know looks over their shoulder and be like, okay, maybe tighten its can work together and try to make like add it to Em are br-2. I mean cause baby you could be like a bunker type situation where you have to go to very specific part of the map. I think they have to work together, you know anything	1.0
Yeah, they're good one. But like the first first one I took was in like a bralette and you were like, oh just like send it on Snapchat.	1.0
So that's incredible. And I you know, I'm really kind of like I was thinking about you today because what you guys decide to do going on World of Dance season 2 the steps that have happened since that appearance, you know, I feel like one thing wouldn't have happened.

Yeah. So yeah, he's like guns or religion to me. And he's like all these specific things that he couldn't do. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I wasn't sure how cool he was. I felt like they're trying to do like kind of like a drive Vibe Ryan Gosling for Drive type 5, which I liked but then that's the vibe that if anything goes wrong, he's definitely capable of fixing it, even though he gets really fucked up. Yeah, but I right he's been he's been like Daddy by a couple of characters who are either smarter than him or whatever. Hmm. So but I guess you know, I got to have like that humanizing element as you watch him kind of learned sure.	1.0
I was asking her last night in the Press line at Dancing with the Stars just how her comedy has helped her because she is a physical comedian when you watch her on the office and she said, you know, I don't dance but I was a good imitation. That was actually pretty good. I've watched a little bit of the office myself, but she's at least an understanding of how her body moves and I think that has sort of helped her.	1.0
Okay. So this is your all and I'm not	-1.0
So the trail is very narrow and I'm in terms of like you've got those are grass trees. They used to call them black boys or not. Yes. Yeah, they're everywhere. And so you've got to hold your arms. Out in front of you very Rocky Trail and yet James changing direction constantly and then it's and then lots of ups and downs like so your one minute you'll be okay. So you can never get a consistent gate not even close and if you look on my almost rather, I went from running five and a half minute Kay's to nine-minute gaze to 11 minutes rise. And and so I was really it was hard to and I That was the point where I was like, okay, I need to put it is a slow down here for it. Yeah, you're pushing a little bit too hard too early. There's a couple of real steep lung busting climbs there. They're only so you're going up like 40% gradient, but it's only for probably 20 or 30 meters but there's lots of little climbs like that. So and then it's all those hands and knees kind of stuff, you know, like and then and and it's very easy to get lost in that section and I know for a fact A fact that a lot of people did get lost taking because this is Trails going off in every conceivable Direction into the scrub and it's beautiful, but I don't know it can it's a little bit too moralizing and that section goes on for maybe 4 or 5 kilometers. I get so does seem to go on then you're going through paddocks and then you go on to more Road and then so about kilometer 30 you hit the road or 31 and then it's about On ches to the next aid station, so to a checkpoint two and that's where my first drop bag was. So I got there feeling not fantastic but not terrible. Like I was all right, and I remember coming through there in about three and a half hours, which was I was happy with the time that I was there even though I just so I slow it up a little bit but I was still passing other because it was a group of people that started at six o'clock. So the slower waves started at 6 a.m. M and the faster wave started at 7:00 a.m. So at that point I caught a few of the six o'clock wave people wouldn't always say hello on the way through I saw at all that shout out to Dion who is one of the ladies I used to coach who completed High School 105 last year and she is an absolute Legend and I coach to through that last year and she gave me a big hug at checkpoint 2, which is really just You know that kind of just really lifted my spirits. So yeah, so checkpoint to grab my bag. I drop bag and stuffed in lots of food because the next section from checkpoint 2 to 3 is what I call the death zone. So it's basically it's the hardest section for multiple reasons. It's 22 kilometers between Aid stations. It's got more really technical climbing. And it's the most exposed section of the course as well. So we went through that and I thought okay if I can get through this next 22 kilometers in about 3 hours. I'll be happy. So so now going through going into what is called a just after the Aid Station you go into you'll T Conservation Park, which I always say it's like deja vu it feels the trails feel exactly like the previous. I should Park really Rocky and twisty and up and down and just like impossible to get a rhythm going and that goes for about a kilometer 30 37 or 38. Maybe maybe 36 2 plus 1 3 or 4 kilometers. I pulled out some pretty slow kilometers through that but I'd used I was feeling a bit negative in that point and I thought this is where I need to just back. Back off a little take the pressure off myself and just to get acknowledged that it's going to be slow. No matter what I do. And so I slowed down eight and I thought when I get out on the runnable sections, I'm going to run and and that's what I did. And by the time you get out to about a kilometer 40 you are certain you can sort of run a bit more you're running through these paddocks though with a grass is so long. Like I'm talking up around my past my waist. You're going through these Farms. Yeah. And it's it really likes get really itchy. You can't say yeah, you can't see the ground and sea running and you don't know whether you stepping in a hole or anything because it's where the cows have been. It's really uneven. So that's technical in a different way, you know like and so I but I managed to get through there without twisting my ankle too badly and I got to about kilometer 45 and I'm coming up on this road and I saw lots of cars coming around this country road and then I remembered that the race has changed this year and they now have a 60 kilometer and 37 and I was coming up on the very start of the 60 kilometer race literally as they were about to start and so perfect. I came in at the back and I was about 50 meters from the start line and heard the three two one and then they all started running and so for the next few case, I had people to run with which is fantastic, you know. It will lift and I think made the rice so much better having a having it finished that way and you run across the hindmarsh tears, which is sort of you this exposed and the road it's kind of endless paddocks and I'd say this is yeah. Like I said, it's the Death Zone on the hot days. It's really hard to get through this section. And then I was starting to I was feeling all right, and then I thought I'll smash some gel. Elle's and I've been I've been drinking my infinite fairly like a being a good boy making sure you're staying on top of my nutrition and my hydration and I had and then about you get to about kilometer 53 and you're at the top of this road called. Would Cone Road and it's it's a four kilometer downhill on on bitumen and dirt road all the way down to the aid station. So it's a real relief you get there and it's not too steep that it hurts but steeper. After you can get a nice roll on and I think what did I do? I was managed to get onto a decent pace through their back so might sort of my goal was every time I was on a runnable section was to try and get into the low six minutes per kilometer. And and on this on that section. I got down under six minutes days and just felt sad to feel good again came into the a station feeling great thinking. I've only got a marathon to go now and it got there. In six out and six and a half hours.	1.0

I'm just trying to think of all the famous Australian people I can and see if he don't know who's the singer that's married either Olivia Newton-John Olivia Newton John Enos her for sure Keith Urban's stinks. Yeah. I hate you thoroughly, but you know, he's betting yeah, I know he's mad. Oh Kevin, it says that because we're talking about how cool things that he does not cool people that he knows Naomi that one second. And yeah, we're really follow up with you to talk about all the cool people must show. You know, it's Mel Gibson cat damn it, you know smoke hips and now I don't think he smells like smell like a bin in Australia. I feel like he is accents totally gone after Mad Max. I know because if you watch your child the old man, man, there's a hardcore kind of cash like Paul. Yes little bit more you listen to them talk now, it's nothing. So why would you ever lose that? Why would you keep that? I know it is he By with his racial slurs a lot more houses in an Australian accent.	1.0
You don't want to bring them to your church because they're going to think it's weird or you don't want to you know, You don't want to talk about the things of God with them or the things that you feel called to do because you know some somewhere deep down inside. You know, that they're not on the same page with you. Well, that's the first thing you need to you need to dump them because they are not on the same page with you and especially if you're a woman and you're looking at this guy and you're like, you know truly he's not everything that I ever thought that I could have in a husband but you know, the devil's lied to you to make you think that you this is as good as it's gonna get I want to tell you if you're in a relationship like that. Get out of it quick and just be thankful that you didn't get married already and just be great glad that you still have time. God can restore redeem and he can push you with the right person, but don't be caught in this trap the way you think that since you're in this relationship already that now you have to conform your life to fit into this relationship with this person. That doesn't have a Zeal for God like you have just because you're already in the relationship for whatever reason it's not it's not permanent. And you know, if you are married then you need to now pray for your spouse. You need to now make it your goal that you're going to believe God that this person is going to come around on the same page with you, but I will tell you that's the harder road to take. So if you're not married to that person yet. Don't marry them based on the fact that you think well because they're just so cute that everything's going to work out even though they have no Zeal for God and you know that you can run circles around them spiritually and they're not even interested.	-1.0

Thomas is $2,000. The glial is $1,800. They're both $200 off on sale special. Whoa, then they added a 16 weeks pass where you can unlock different price tiers kind of like Fortnight the exact same way they set up battle pass in Fortnight, which is just a good system. It's just extra content free cases and stuff like that. Then they added skins for the models in your game. So they added all like different like kind of better looking models to the game. And even though the game's first person they So added a screen at the end that gives you accolades for different things that you did best during the game. So if you had like a highest ATR most headshots or whatever you'll all be on display for your team to see and then they will show you liked what you were actually best at so like utility damage or Flash assists or ADR and then you get there. There's where you get to see the the Skins as well. I'm trying not to reach out right now and then they also added three new cases for new knife skins. Or for new knives with all of the same all the skins and then they added new map to scrimmage mapped as was is just made by like a community mapper. They had a like some Scouts knives math.	1.0

He loves Derek's or why not and started doing just some digging and I noticed that the second that people started talking to you and by people, I mean industry people insiders people involved with the show. That's when things kind of started to go sour on the steric side, and I think That that 100% is because of jealousy basically and then they're like, well, you know who's pulling him stuff? Why does he get to know anything and that's usually kind of how that starts.	-1.0

Every lesson that you learned in the process of life, it's time you into something you're not. Life is pain and it removes some of the greatest things we ever had.

So there's the typical what people see in the media right that people living on the street that are using hardcore drugs. That's what is all of the TV. So that's what people think that that's where the crisis is, but it's anywhere from The Accidental overdoses from people or first-time users sharing a pill Young. Is trying to get high first first time sharing a fake Dilaudid or something and they accidentally overdose versus just a an elderly patient who may have certain morphine or Dilaudid on board as well other pain medications if they accidentally take too much that still isn't stolen overdose. And if you have a kid, you could still use that to help them come out of it. You have there's there's so many facets to to being able to respond to an emergency and there's could be totally though just those accidental overdoses fentanyl now is in everything. Some people are putting it in in cigarettes and selling them as Cocoa Puffs. So they think it's cocaine mixed in with the tobacco. However, it's actually fentanyl it's fennel. So cheap, right? So they gets caught with everything we're seeing in our area now with one of the the team's I On we're seeing friend all in everything. We're seeing in crystal meth we're seeing in cocaine. We're seeing it in marijuana. So people are just lazy it with it. So you never know what you're getting. So people always argue with us say, oh, it's I get it from my normal guy fickle that street pharmacist. Sorry. It's not gonna be it's not gonna be as as good or as pure as you said, you never know the consistency of it. So when you Consistency. I always go back to one story of you know, two people they want to split a pill they break it in half. The one person takes it he over also the other person takes the other half. He's not going to overdose and the reason is because it's there's no consistency that you can't you can't mix it super well, like I always describe taking a handful of salt throwing it on table take a pinch of salt and so the color Sprinkle it over that and you're going to see a random assortment of different colors specs in nicer cutting that up into piles that one pile might have two specs three specs for aspects that other pile might only had one Speck and depending on where that spec gets put on your side of the pill or whatever wherever you're smoking or injecting. You don't know the consistency of it. So that's why some people overdose harder and go down while harder than others when you you took a picture of	-1.0
Yeah, goddamn it. Good wait now he's like damn right?	-1.0
Well, that's I'm really glad that you don't have a major problem injury at think it's a it's sort of Testament.

I mean, I've had a few in I don't get into what I'm bit like you that I have had a couple of injuries this year, which is big It's train but you know, so yeah fantastic.

So you knew that playing I hit like, oh my God, it is join drops.	1.0
Yeah, so that really ties to a lot of the research that we've been doing over the last three years on what we call mega-projects mega-projects find US capital intensive projects that require multiple teams pull off and they usually in excess of a billion dollars that we've seen have created lots of stress on the industry and on stakeholders within the industry owners designers. And and contractors and what we mean by you know, those the challenge for those projects being business-driven is going to take a large NFL stadium. For example, we have some sort of deadline that we've established for the stadium open probably based on kickoff of game one a couple Seasons from now and so we've got to figure out how to pull together the capital and power the contractor to the designed to get that accomplished within a another find window not necessarily. Taking the other crochet if we were going to build a structure like this, logically and efficiently, how long would it take? You know, we may be three season from now that that Stadium would logically be open and could be built in a way that the the labor market could provide sufficient labor. The contractors could do sufficient planning. The designer would have enough time to thoroughly designed the building to the extent that it's ready to be constructed by a contractor. It's the business pressures and that's just one example, you can apply that to really any project where there's a economic outcome a reason why they're every every project as an impetus for being constructed and if it's a private project because the return on investment the people are looking for if it's a public project is that there's a public use right and and those deadlines are driven by really the reasoning behind them project and that's very well understandable, but I think some of those deadlines of expectations but the public eye and from a business TenPoint have outstripped the capacity the construction industry to deliver on those expectations. And that's where we really see challenges. So back to the stadium example, we want to build a stadium in two years great. We don't have the local label Market to support it. We don't have time to pull the design together and we would stress the contractor Community to build it but we're going to try to do it anyways and roll the dice and see what happens and sometimes when you see favor welcomes, but more and more on these large projects. We are seeing unfavorable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.	-1.0

Not just our horses, you know, we we all those committees at a service that's good throughout good quality throughout that's something that we really pride ourselves in here with our rodeo company is We're not yet. I don't want to ever be just label the horse guy or just a bull guy or a guy that has mediocre rough stock and great time today. We try and be full service. We want the best pickup man. The best bullfighter we can get the best book Bronx bareback and Bulls and and even time to be in cattle. We want to be good at it all. You know that I something that that I wouldn't when we first started this one of the one of the guys that I've Has looked up to that I've always thought had excellent stock throughout was Sammy Andrews Sam. He's always had good bulls and good horses. He wasn't just a bull guy or just a horse guy. It's so and that for me. That's not my want to pride myself in this being a Stockman not just one one one sided because at the end of the day those guys paid their entry fees to they need they deserve a decent shot, you know, so he's so leading into the to the 2019 season.	1.0
Yeah. I was like hey, I'm coming over nice.	1.0
Okay. So the one thing that redeem this episode for me was in fact the ending, however We already discussed how the ending was kind of a little much because they were like, oh like we should have forgiven each other before me like blah blah blah and that was just in genuine.

I like that idea for the in-game. So it's like the last squad or something and I can't remember what episode it was, but we did bring up Titans in the fact that like what if it was I think it was actually it was our first reader mail and somebody somebody had brought up like It was something like evolve. We're like there was one person on each squad or there. You know, there is they tweak the numbers so that basically it was kind of like evolved in the sense that you had to hunt down this Titan and kill it and I think something like that or something, where's this super rare item? And then you'll be able to call it in but you have to go to like certain spots to call it in the you can't just like have it call in anywhere. Yeah, I mean because once again, I hate to compare it to Fortnight, but when Fortnight has like it's Thanos limited time run. I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just have this nice little limited time thing. You have the Titans. It makes people happy, but then I guess the other problem with that. Is that what if it makes it better exactly.	1.0

So someone said to me once which I never forgot was that branding isn't just about your logo on your website. It's actually about you you the brand of your business and people want to see you. And they want to hear your story and they want to see how you can transform and that room from a vacant to a beautifully stubbed property. So I like I've not always been game enough to put my face onto Instagram stories. It's just something that I realized that people I actually got a lot more traction when I was being real and honest on camera, and I'm not shy to show the warts and all of home staging it isn't just about that beautiful. Sad room at the end of the day and I yeah, I think people really appreciate that but also in such a small Regional area. I think it's it's really good to put your face out there as well because people then just build that trust with you and your brand I guess. Yep couldn't agree more.	1.0
But anyways, so, you know now I have this deep peace and I've gone through the whole the whole, you know, like realization that everything that nobody special because everybody special right? So and so like I was cool.	1.0

Like I told you don't watch them at home. Yeah, I'll watch some on the plane. So I'll do all of the show watching. So then yeah because if I wasn't if I didn't have that part where I could just say, like I'll have like a tattle I can say I'll have like 20 hours a month on a plane. So there I can just put all my show time. They're not waste any of my other time. So that but if I didn't do that then yeah, I probably wouldn't watch a lot of shows.	-1.0

Elite divers like the team you're on like how long can you be under water at any given time before you would have to come up for air many hours how many hours because that's a beauty of the real because it recirculates your own from your body has a carbon dioxide absorb in inside it that absorbs that CO2 and then you basically just keep rebreathing and the little tanks of gas whether they be oxygen or nitrogen. Helium for deep diving they just squirt a little bit of extra air in so the little tanks last way longer so we could we would do a tax swims in the middle of the night for anywhere up to three hours.	1.0

But yeah, and they had a really cool Studio great opportunities there with meeting people. People I had people coming in all the time. That was the first time I got to work on like a large set. I work with like Danny Trejo and I got to get my hands on expensive Hollywood equipment. I think, you know the guys I met there that have been there for a long time in the grip house. They did like Dumb and Dumber and Matilda and The Sandlot all these really cool movies and it was just it was fun to like set around the lunch table and listen to these stories from these grips, you know, and totally and awesome. Yeah again mentoring right so I didn't still think in the back of my head. I didn't learn a lot in college, but now I'm still learning right I was able to take the knowledge from that country. And Redman and apply it to forward I was able to apply forward and keep pushing forward. So I walk in and getting one day get this I'm there for maybe eight months and a show canceled from show time that we were doing a lot of work on remember the show was yes blood and oil. So we were we had just invested I say we but the owner had just invested a lot of money into these huge Airy lights like Sky panel not Sky panels the way bigger than that. They're like do their you could like fit inside of them. They're the biggest Lights I've ever seen they create they create like Son basic, right and he bought three of them and I guess the invested all his money into those. They're still doing great right now. Redmond is basically long story short. That was they didn't have money to pay us anymore. So guess what head on the chopping block number to yank?	1.0
Yeah, and I was like, I don't know if I can do this without my husband. He's like well bring him with you. I was like, well it's hard because we have all those like students in New York. You can't just leave all our students and you know, so we really had to think about it and Pasha right away said you're going yep and he held down the fort while you were on tour with the your students and did teachers like well, let's not say anything yet, and I told her a red rose. I don't know like we'll see and then once again when he asked me I was like, all right. Well, let's do this like will do the tour and so super fun.	1.0
Old but we were like let's go camping. There's this like camping place in Salem. I don't even know where it was. We drive there we park where would like a huge group of people obviously, my drug dealer beu is there and probably selling the whole time. This is like a business trip for him and I'm like, he loves me he's here for me and he loves you little did he know he ever did it's fine. And though wouldn't know yeah a sane literally have no idea if he's even still with us. I happiest but peace and blessings. But so we get all hammered and I feel like in high school. That's just when like it's not even funny now when I think about it, but back then it was hilarious. We have this watermelon, and we were going to smoke out of it and it wasn't working.	1.0
An idea like some scripts you read you just like this is incredible other scripts you read like hmm, you know, I could see it working. If and then some scripture read. I mean most scripts. I read them like this terrible, you know, I mean you spend most of your time saying no, but you know, you just try to get to those the mid-range ones because the reality is some scripts you read and it's like the concept is there it's not quite executed on paper, but If you get these four actors together, you ain't got to worry about it because they're gonna go boom and do their thing.	1.0
I feel yourself a little bit, right?	1.0
I thought was pretty good until next.	1.0
Just whatever. I feel like using at that time and I will wash the dishes and then rinse them under running water as hot as I can stand and then put them in the drying rack and they do they do soak a little bit before I start washing them because I start out with real hot water and then it soaks a little bit while the water is getting a little bit cooler just to where it's you know, it's not too hot. So there's kind of a soaking involved there.	1.0
Stood in the statements you were making about Syria being a suit serial Builder and I've heard it said in the past and I believe this was amongst commercial users that 90% of the things that are built are built by a one-time owner. I don't know that I could substantiate those statistics at this point because that's probably 10 to 12 years old in anecdotal at best. But are you seeing that as kind of the Difference Maker it seems like that's what picture you paint. That's the Difference Maker between a large industrial users is that they've got the capital in the know how to plan? Whereas these commercial users that are in there from one time. They don't have the capital to know how or the care because the savings aren't large enough to go into it with a mentality of we're going to prefabricate. We're going to modularize we're going to do off-site construction. Is that fair to say?	-1.0

Then cheers standing up value strategic play behaviors wanted Play calling Captain lead Huddle's reinforcements ask team to call a play and run it celebrate tips in open areas by understanding what you want out of your players. You are able to better communicate your expectations to them designing reinforcements ahead of time leaves only one task remaining implementation. Now try and come up with your own list bounce back and forth between your values and behaviors wanted then think of how you'll reinforce them. Consistency is key here. Make sure the reinforcements are something you can keep up with. Otherwise, the behaviors may not be consistent either. You might find that throughout the season you will add new behaviors to your wish list and you'll probably change some of your reinforcements if they aren't working and add new ones only change something if it absolutely does not work or if you find that you cannot keep up with it.	1.0

I just feel like the Beehive I thought they did great but I feel like they're like little little gimmicks overshadowed like they're emceeing a Lil Bit whereas I feel like black holes they did a great job of kind of incorporating their themes and their themes not overshadowing their emceeing I guess that's what I'm trying to say, but they did they both did great and so I'm glad either one of them would one so I'm happy with beehive wedding. So there I do think that the black hole was built on Monet and Monique's personalities and the be high was built more on the concept. So I totally I totally agree with you there.	1.0

So it's not going to be like it's going to be obviously a hot Drop. I think teams will like multiple teams will aim for it. So you'll have like that hot battle outside of that Titan, so it'll be interesting and and I'd have never played.	1.0

Could you just back? I mean obviously when we couldn't go to a situation where we're holding gold coins and paying for things with gold and silver the physical mental again. I guess that's never going to happen, but we could have money that's backed by gold or silver and therefore it we could make small transactions because it's just a denomination of of a percentage of a gold bar. So in other words when Bitcoin first started out it was Worth mere sense. It was just a tiny value.

I think it was in the bareback ride. Anyway, he looks pretty good. I think that horse he'll be he'll he'll be 5 this year so he got a little more age on him and then some of them because he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he bucks pretty Dang good and and I saw I think that that'll be a up-and-coming star for us this summer moving forward in and there's a there's a couple of other Colts that are that are coming on.

You know, I'm flying back from San Diego on Thursday and like they announced right before takeoff that there would be no Wi-Fi and I'm like, here we go again, like let me put out to the world that I'm not going to have Wi-Fi for the next handful of hours just so that when they inevitably trade Francisco Lindor and I'm just silent and not doing any reporting. It's not my fault and then I realized about I don't know. Most of the way into the flight that United has that they have that I message option. So you turn on their Wi-Fi and you of iMessage so I had nothing else but I had iMessage so I turned it on and you and some other people have texted me. You just said Bill Dance and Eddie a statue and I'm like, oh my God, they traded Linder and they got a hall from the Dodgers like and this is seriously happening happening now, and I texted you back and I said, All right, I think well it was in the Chicago. So I had a layover in Chicago. So it was on the Chicago part of the flight and you know that flights like 45 minutes. Yeah, and I think I had 25 minutes left in the flight and I'm like do I need to pay the 1099 for Wi-Fi for the you know, even though I'm gonna have to put away my laptop in 10 minutes and you're like no calm down. It's some knucklehead who covers the Falcons on the radio who comes out with this room, but I was pretty panicked there for a couple of Minutes and I thought we were going to have a legitimate part 2 to the annual tradition of not having Wi-Fi in a cross-country flight after the winter meetings.	1.0

I didn't know what to expect. I think you know because originally like when my mom was telling me I was hesitant, you know, I was you know, I don't need to meet him and you know, she was just like no just meet your father and I should you know, and and when I think about it now and my mother and I have never Discussed this but when I think about it now, you know, some of that was probably for her as well like yo, I had this kid together married for a couple of years like you ain't been in his life and which would make sense to me. I get it like at least see him once you know, but for me, I really didn't have any expectation, you know, and It you know, it's a it's a weird thing, you know, but for me, I took all of those emotions and I turned them into fuel a really transformed all of those. I guess you could call them negative feelings and I transformed it into fuel, you know, and and and I also use that you know, I felt like I'm the man of the house. I gotta protect you. I gotta protect my mother. I'm gonna make sure she good, you know, and I took it and ran.	1.0
That's the beauty of this year's draft. However, I do think the Packers are actually pretty much enamored with one specific. Pacific player much like gudykunst says he was last year with Jai you are Alexander. I think that guy could be Noah Fant this year and I think 12 might be just a bit Rich for Noah Fant. If we're being quite honest, I would like to see him taken in the late teens early 20s, if possible. I think that that kind of meets the place where we could see a run on tight ends based off some of the other teams needs and value fits and stuff like that. No offense would be a dynamic player and a dynamic I did. Into this Packers offense and not to take away from TJ Hawkinson, but I think no offense. It's just Far and Away a better athlete even though the relative at the relative Athletic score would indicate. Otherwise, I just think that fan is going to provide more dynamic system from the tight end position than Hawkinson will I think fans are very capable blocker not as not as bad as he's given credit for he definitely has some work to do in the area, but I think he could be a very serviceable blocker moving forward and I think that given that that quality and that characteristic I think that he's going to be heads above TJ Hawkinson career-wise.	1.0
It's so bright, but it's never like never class you so yes, so Runway the theme was Plastic Fantastic which was weird to me because I was like, why won't you have a be a club Kid theme is drive me crazy when the runway theme doesn't match the challenge right?	1.0

So I actually posted recently on my Instagram a picture and it was just like a picture of me and just like very open. So personally, I was always very shy and I never really wanted to try new things and I was very close and Just in general I would I like to be in my bubble and ever and ever like to try anything new. So she was always trying to get me to do different shows and whatnot. And then she always said to me trust the process. This is something that since I was a little kid she was just telling me non-stop if I always doubted my like if I doubted myself or whatever it was she said trust the process everything happens for a reason if your I remember just like losing one competition. We were like next in the final or something like that and I remember coming out of that cup. Shouldn't and I was just so sad. I was like, oh my God, whatever I'm doing. It's just not happening. It's I don't know. What like what what else could I possibly do to be in that final and this that and the other and she's like trust the process. It happened for a reason and it definitely did because I remember the next competition. I was so hungry for it and I wasn't I was just trying to do I wasn't trying to compete with anybody else. I was really just competing with myself and trying to improve myself more and I remember that petition ended up in the final and doing really well. So like things like that. She always let me know that everything happened for a reason and if something didn't happen it's meant to be that way and funny enough about two years ago. We tried out for Dancing With the Stars. Oh you did and we didn't get it and I was like all this you know, this is something I really want. I've I've always watched the show and I'm like super big fan and it's something I've always wanted to do. When we got the call that we weren't going to be on it. I was actually really sad and I was talking to her about it and she's like then it wasn't your time. It's right just continue doing what you're doing. And that's actually when we went on World of Dance. Oh, yeah, we want door closes exactly how the door open and that year. We actually tried out we auditioned for World of Dance. We got onto World of Dance and we kept competing. We kept perfecting our technique and and then when we did get the call for this year's Dancing with the Stars real	1.0
Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Fan into flame podcast. I'm your host as always Tyler warfel. Thanks for coming back and listening to another episode on this episode. We're going to give our season recap of the Fall Sports season, which were tremendous really historic seasons for our volleyball and soccer teams. We interview the soccer Captain's Christian Josh and Auggie. We also interview the volleyball seniors Amanda and Renee. We did have a slight audio malfunction during the soccer interview in my iPad fell over but we decided to just roll. That starting with soccer the boys won the dvcac championship for the second straight year by beating Chestertown again this time by a score of 3 to 2. In my opinion. This was the best of the Championships since we've been back in the dvcac the last four years. We've played Chestertown each of those four years. The first year was 2016 and we'd split with them in the regular season. I kind of thought we were the better team Alex scored an early goal in that game, but Chestertown scored to kind of flew key goals. The first one was just kind of a bad mistake barkeeper. / and the second one was a little controversial in that it was a long shot from near the corner. It looked like the ball might have gone out of bounds in the air and then come back in regardless. It was enough to give Chestertown a 2-1 win the next year in 2017. I don't think there's a question that we were the better team. We had beaten them for 1 and 5 3 in the regular season, but the game got kind of ugly there were lots of fouls going around the final score ended up being 4-3 in overtime. But three of the goals were scored on penalty kicks to from us and one. Them there just wasn't really a good flow to the game which in my opinion gave Chestertown the advantage in that game and to their credit. They took advantage in one in overtime last year, even though the final score was two to one. I feel like we kind of dominated the game Chestertown scored late to make it a one goal game. But as a fan at least it didn't really ever feel like we're going to lose. It was a great atmosphere great environment IDE Turf a lot of fans a night game under the lights great atmosphere, but we scored early and pretty much control the play. Why this year was different? Like I said from a fan perspective. I think this was the best game. I think the teams were very evenly matched. They both played. Well Augie scored in about the 10th minute to give GMS a one nothing lead, but Chestertown pressed up and scored a nice goal about 15 minutes later the tied at 1-1 and it looked like they really had the momentum at that point heading into halftime and looked like we kind of needed to regroup but right before halftime Augie worked a little magic. You dribble between a handful of Chestertown Defenders and scored about a minute. With a half-time whistle to give GMS a two to one lead. That was a huge goal to get the momentum back on our side but Chestertown came out in the second half continue to press continued to play well and they found another equalizer with probably about 25 minutes left in the game. They got a long throw in from either Corner found an unmarked man for a header to tie the game at 2-2, but with 10 or 15 minutes left Auggie again dribbled past a few Defenders got into the box and got tackled from behind for a penalty kick which he converted pretty easily in the To the upper left corner, and that would be the final score it ended three two, there were some nervous moments at the end Chestertown kept attacking and had several good chances, especially on set pieces and Corner kicks, but our defense held on Christian had a really strong game. David was really good in gold and I think you had other Defender step up and play well and not make mistakes. I thought between Austin and Kobe and I thought Adam and Cody did a good job, too of not making any defensive errors. There were a few Corner kicks that were a little worried. With Chestertown players that were unmarked but overall the defense gave a really good performance. So it was a really exciting game. We had a lot of fans support despite the fact that it was a Saturday afternoon on the day of the Fall auction and not a very short drive up to bear. So it was a good day for GM s soccer a great way to end a really good season boys finished with an overall record of 13 wins one loss and 1 tie this season. They were 9 and 1 in conference play and obviously dvcac soccer overall. Is not the highest level of play, but I think it's improving and there weren't as many blowouts this year as in the past couple of years Chestertown Calvary and Faith Baptist were all pretty competitive. But in the three non conference games, we went to wins and 1 tie combine this year and last year and you have a two year record of 29 wins one loss into ties with to conference championships. That's really impressive and it's actually the best two-year run in GMS soccer history, and I think it just speaks to the job. Mr. Bechtel has On as a coach in building a program and there's been some really talented soccer players the last several years and some of that have been kind of unexpected. You know, Alex Augie and Christian all transferred to GMS for high school and didn't go here during elementary and middle school. So it's always nice to be able to add that level of ability into your program when you don't necessarily see that coming from the Middle School team. Then you also have Caleb and Joshua Lee who are also very talented soccer players that have been at GMS since kindergarten and throw in David Mendez into that mix too. But what's impressive about what the soccer program is a right now is that you get a lot of production from guys. You wouldn't necessarily consider themselves soccer players. You can see the Improvement of skills year by year from guys like Kobe and Ryan and Carson and Adam guys. It didn't really grow up playing soccer. But Mr. Bechtel gets the best out of them and to me that's the sign of a program that's here to stay and speaking of that. This is this team has no seniors. So they'll return to everyone from a team that just had Tremendous season to look for another big year and in our leg there aren't a lot of seniors Chestertown only graduates to Calvary just one and Faith Baptist doesn't have any seniors either so look for next year to be a really competitive year in the dvcac and I know that like worship rep who's kind of the top dog in the easyacc has seen some of our scores last couple of years. They want to play us next year. So next year could be a lot of fun for our soccer team will wrap up soccer with some awards because we've placed first in the regular season. Mr. Bechtell got to select seven of his players to play in the dvcac All-Star Game this year Junior's Augie Pacheco Christian quillin, Austin, swartzentruber Carson UNC and Josh Willie were selected along with sophomore David Mendez and freshman Nevin Yahtzee for Christian and Josh. It was their third All-Star selection for Austin for Augie. It was his second and for Austin Carson David and Nevin, this was their first time playing in the game Augie Christian Josh and Devon were additionally named to the all-conference. The team which is the best 11 in the conference and that's a really high honored to be named that team. We have posters that we make for the all-conference players. They'll be hung up at school sometime in the coming days. Augie was given medals for being the leading goal scorer and the leader in assists in the conference during the regular season and Josh was given one for leading in assists. He and Augie tied Atop The League for most assists a few other statistical leaders that weren't recognized at the All-Star games, but just throw these out there David Mendez was six in the league in goals. With seven which is impressive because he mostly plays goalie. Christian quillin was seventh in assists with for Carson Yahtzee with 18 goals with 6th and 10th and assist with three Nevin Yahtzee was 7th and assist with for and 11th in goals with four and then obviously all he led the league in both goals and assists 21 goals 11 assists and that's just in conference play Josh tied for first in assist with 11 and was 16 goals with seven. So that's a wrap on soccer. Make sure to come back next year and watch Team that we return everyone and some exciting things could be happening next year for our soccer team Auggie is just two goals away from becoming just the eighth player in GMS history to score 50 or more goals and Josh is just one assist away from joining Auggie in the 25 assist Club. Joshua be the seventh player in program history to have 25 or more assists look for that early in the season. All right. I'm joined Now by Christian. Hey, Josh and Auggie captains of the soccer team. You guys had a great season last year you had two of the all-time greats here Alex you leading assist of all time and EMS history killed the leading goal scorer all time. You lost them to graduate from last year and yet you still managed to have a great season. What did you have to do this season to make up for the losses of those two guys.	0.0

So every like two weeks we would try to take well actually every night we would take one dance and we would Like that one dance to make sure okay. Are we on sorry. I was in the right spot. Are we on our marks? All right. Let's try to make this better. So every single night we'd have one dance we'd focus on so that that night it would be a good like a good quality number with a right positions and makes you like make sure it's clean. So I think because of that it really helped towards the middle and end of the tour to stay clean because we did try and perfect the dances one at a time instead of like kind of Try to do everything will open the whole show doesn't necessarily work. No, so dedicating one day to one dance really really truly helped a lot. And I think that's that was the key.	1.0

Okay, like I shouldn't be having to like take shots of a smoothie to try gulp it down. Right?

I think it so I have a 20 year old 15 year old and 11 year old now the you know, I think any parent, you know the for the first thing you want your kids to be safe, right, you know, then you want them to feel loved and then you want them to learn right and to learn to teach themselves. And what I found is that like Parenthood is just like life. It happens in phase. It's like I've never been the father of a 20 year olds. This is a whole new part of the ride so I can you know what? I mean? It's like my daughters like ya next year for my birthday. We gonna have a drink and I'm like, wow, okay, she's gonna be turning 21 wide, right? And so I kind of and I'm and I'm I tell my kids that like, sometimes they come to me with certain things. I'm like, I don't know. I'm trying to figure this out like you are you know, but I think that's the challenge is to one of the other challenges is to sort. of unlearn generational You know patterns that you know that we just do is families or as black families or you know, so like for my kids never beat my kids, you know, I don't want them to get whip now for me. I needed to get whoops. Oh, I'm not mad at my mom's right I get it. But you know as a parent I was just I specially because my first to wil girls I never wanted him to have a memory of a man putting a hand on them and that starts with me now to challenge it at is but it becomes psychological warfare because when they messing up, you know there You need to have some lines of authority. So they learn you know, the rules in life, but then it's like okay, how do you because you certain instinctual feelings you have you know, so it's challenging its challenges constantly challenging that it you know, with the oldest. Like I said, it's like it's a whole new ballgame of Connection and all right, how do you because I can't just snatch you up and throw you in the back. You know, you got your own apartment your own car. So this is all right. How do we wait this out that yeah, but I'm still your father.	-1.0

Hey guys, it's yell. I just wanted to let you know about my holiday Empowerment Group. It's my group coaching program that will start the week before New Year's and continue throughout January and it's an alternative for people who want to escape the pervasive diet culture messaging and leave the New Year's wait resolutions behind and instead focus on your true health and becoming a more intuitive eater. So you'll receive 10 Deep learning videos. From me that I'll send out weekly each focusing on a different principle of intuitive eating how to break down and understand the principles and actually start living them. You'll also receive guided somatic meditations that allow you to understand the principles in an embodied way and not just cognitively you'll also receive reflective questions that allow for deeper introspection that you can translate these principles into your own life. So we also will meet every other The other week as a group to empower and support each other through a time that can be really stressful and difficult. If you're working towards a more enjoyable peaceful relationship with food know that there is another way and we're here for you. If you would love to join us. I'd love to have you you can head to my website and powered palette.com and find out about the holiday Empowerment Group there. Thanks so much. Hey guys, it's Lia at Dan Casey.	1.0
I went back to work full-time after six months. Wow. Are you serious? Yeah. So one of my greatest be the will the greatest be wasn't about Losing the leg in the hand. It was about losing my career because it's called it was it was everything to me. I loved it and I fought so hard to achieve that and I was terrified of losing it and so instead of letting that fear crippled me. I used it as a motivator and I let it push me into die with you know, just two days after my legs chopped off. I'm trying to do one-handed pull-ups on the bar above my bed so that I can start training and then I went home and I had one of my best friends who Really was a savior. He quit his job up north moved in with me and act as a carer and cooked for me and clean for me and drove me around. I really couldn't have done it without him. You can't undervalue the just the smallest amount of support in these situations. And so I was in the gym at the army base every single day training learning to use my body again working with the prosthetic companies to try and develop weightlifting Prosthetics. And so yeah over a year and a half to have three More surgery to remove bone spurs and that was always very hard progressing and then going in for surgery and going back to square one again. So that was pretty emotionally draining and having to get back on the drugs again, and I was self-administering Oxycontin and own which is the fast-acting oxy Gabapentin, which is a nerve blocker antidepressants for the nerve pain sleeping tablets. And so I could smash as much of that in my head as I wanted, but I kind I knew what it was like to live in a cloud. Cloud from when I was a teenager and I was smoking heaps a weed and was working in Hospitality doing other party drugs and I swore to myself. I wouldn't go back to that person. And so I got off the drugs as fast as I could got back to work and just started trying to prove myself that I deserve to be there.	1.0

It said something and then a guy posted something on a store on his Twitter later and like a year later and it was like a whole scavenger hunt set up by the person through the show. So and then like it was interesting actually.	1.0
It was funny but unnecessary the thing about yeah, I okay. So the thing about this is that I thought that the idea of it was funny and that the outfits that they put on the spot on and like, I don't know I thought that was well done.

Yeah, that's the way to go. That's the way to do it.

Chuckles yeah, the political leadership of those countries. They I mean in Asia 1997 your Thailand Indonesia. So on the leadership of those countries are no places elsewhere to go. They were stuck with their God their own country. Yeah. Okay, so they were dependent on getting the country back on the rails, but now the political Elites in Portugal and Spain Greece anywhere. Have you brought this lava and Slovakia Romania and so on I mean there Korea's a lot within their own countries and within the operators of the European Union, so they want to go to vassals. They want to have jobs that are created by the European Union lavishly funded so paid under with the same Revenue relation has similar jobs in Germany and so on but then in their own countries, so that's what they want. Their loyalty are not their own country. They are increasingly to this international organization.	-1.0
Getting the cross yesterday and we'll move on from that game all unless are you going to have just been really boring but atmosphere and yeah, I read kicked him in the are 12 and it's added on and we got the goal.

Yeah, like you say their keeper was good. And I thought they just played at their skin, which is a big game for them with coming tomorrow their fans. We have mentioned their fans. They were amazing. Yeah. Yeah, everybody said they were genuinely the best fans. I think I've ever seen him on you.	1.0
They would agree that clearly. I mean we have too much of going lately too much of government intervention everywhere. The results are very bad. If you look at it from the point of view of the actual performance of the system to which they to be by academic. Education that economic growth income and wealth distribution as as far as the economy is concerned all these they always screw up right? So you need less of this the problem if you want to turn it back is that it's really it's It's much more difficult than adding a little bit of it to the existing system existing system. So if you have the current system and you have it more government involvement in education, so on a little more that's not a big shake-up for the whole system. It just makes it paralyzed that it a little bit more if you increase taxes a little bit more that's not a big shake-up. So it just makes it marginally more difficult unless you try to turn. Back, we got a problem, especially in the economy. We got a big problem because the economy is so fragile because it is sort of become a Dead junkie but under the influence of monetary interventions in particular. So if you scale back a little bit of this Q fragile eyes and migrate the bankruptcy of certain elements of the economy at this might entail snowboarding effects that have the potential of going on. On all the rest of the economy with that so it's not easy to go. The other direction of I tend to think that as the rule you should think big as you guys are doing apparently because you're raising a big question and you should not be afraid of considering a complete overhaul just cutting a bit from under-20 something like this. I mean certainly the case of money and government spending in the economy. It's on this concert. I think that's definitely a really realistic option.	-1.0

We usually exposed what we've been doing lately. We used to expose 25 to 30 of them depending on you know, a couple of things just how well I like the young men remember a little bit ago. I talked about exposing young fillies, you know for three four year old Phillies. Well, depending Come on, how many I want to put in those into the system for you get a cold out of so but to answer your question directly. Yeah, 25 to 30 of them. And then generally that means that you'll get you know, they'll they'll be a few measures that don't get bread. So you'll I usually shoot to have 20 calls a year at least 20, you know 22 you'll end up with so if you exposed 30 mares, ideally you'd get 30 calls, but generally speaking you're going to get 25 or 26 right in that area and then and then same same deal as finally read exposed 25 meters. It's more like, you know, you know right around 20 to 21 22 and then there's been years like I Beretta I studied calvary's a couple years ago. Tiger Warrior actually, he's are really really great blocker and really bread well and when we breath tiger Warrior, I put him with 20 mares because that was the deal we made. Made with those guys and heck. I think I only ended up with 13 goals. And that was it that wasn't tiger Warriors fault or anybody's fault. It was just one of those things where that was year was real wet and rainy and and not lost sunshine and the mayor's didn't circled. I'm sorry didn't cycle that well, and and so it wasn't all his fault. It was just one of those things that have Mother Nature. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, I when I talk to our vet around home here, and he said he was having trouble. Even getting like the cut and horses and reining horses in the people in the with the saddle horses around he was trying to having hell getting a the mayor's ovulate for him, you know, so it was just one of those Springs. It was just a tough.	-1.0

So we're so tired, but we're so excited because we knew so many people in the audience and there were going to be so many celebrities and famous choreographers and we're like everybody we cannot mess up because this is going to be the best show in that. The reaction from the audience was so cool. Like it's just a great show it gave them really.	1.0
Oh you've been in this business since you were 17, when you look back over your career, which obviously is, you know, still going pretty strongly what it's not I don't mean necessarily. In terms of a movie or a role but like what are you most proud of when you look back on the longevity of your career?	1.0
Well I do that I went to get when I put him to bed. Jay Sears, eiga bring-bring brings it a little bit broader. So it doesn't like the homework, but she hates all the school paper work the permission slips the lunch orders the hours each week. So my kid will bring home a folder. Yeah and a half of the folder is like homework or stuff for him. And the other half is like stuff for the parents. Look at that. Maybe once every three weeks missing all sorts of permission sense. Yeah. Yeah vital piece of but his teachers this year actually send emails would like here's tonight's homework and stuff that you can look at but look too many emails.	-1.0
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too that or yuck.	1.0
I'm sorry shows you Bruce police officers were beaten up in bra was like that cheering. Is it nah? Well if they would have we're documenting his job because he's been everywhere.	-1.0
Yeah, and I think that's like so much you were like a such a great mindset because yeah, you met Miss three weeks and running but you don't miss you know, four months of running consistently. So your Fitness, you know dropped a little bit but not like it would if you miss four months, so yeah, so you like that's so good luck to you all. Learning from one of your first major injuries and and I feel like the way you've gone about this one has been really good and so far we couldn't have done any better in terms of settling it down because as soon as you got saw you responded we looked at it and we've gone about trying to settle it down like which is yeah. I mean, it's fantastic like I would recommend that to anyone back home like if you've got got An injury respond respond to it straight away. But at the same time how do you know what's an injury like often? We've all got Nichols as Runners and if we get to to responsive to niggles, then we wouldn't run. Yeah. So how did you know that it just you couldn't run it's a different kind of pain.	1.0
This is fine. But like it doesn't do much for me. Like what does it do for you? Tell me what it does for you. I so it depends I guess on the situation like I love a good dick pic because I just need all the information like I need to know what your dick looks like. It just makes me feel like we're a friends on a whole nother level. I love that but also like when you get a dick pic, and it's like I caused this dick. To be hard it is the most amazingly like makes me feel like the baddest bitch the hottest bitch, you know, like I did that I guess what I did. I've never thought of that right?	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So that is a lot of Social Capital emotional Capital moral capital is still there, but you can destroy and consume this kind of capital as well. Right? So we're working our way is one layer of yeah, I think the evidence is strong. It's not conclusive. I think this the evidence is strong that has been Capital consumption as compared to 20 or 30 years ago. And then there are other forms of capital Social Capital ball Capital emotional Capital which all cultural Achievements have been a lot of the way are the basis of our current economic and social order. And of course, we are destroying the winning at them as well. And that's where I see the two problems in the long run another. I mean, I'm an economist so professionally, of course, I'm I'm interested in material things as you are as well because you are working in the financial markets, but I'm much more concerned in the long run about the destruction of the moral foundations.	-1.0
Exactly and I think I think a lot more people will be critical of the second season, like hoping that they kind of learn from how the community has provided feedback about the first season because I know I think the consensus overall There's this disappointment and liverworts and I think a lot of people don't like that 20% of the battle pass is just all those badges those number badges that no one's going to use. Yeah. Yeah.	-1.0
It's time for Chompers your morning and night toothbrushing show start brushing on the top of your mouth on one side and brush the inside outside and chewing side each two three.	0.0
maximize drawer space and then I realized I was storing some framed decorations that were just things that you know, I got in at thrift stores or whatever that I wasn't using at my current house and I thought you know what I'm just going to I'm just going to get rid of these because they're taking up space in one of my clothing drawers and they probably been in there since we moved so sometimes I have to thin down my drawers and part of it is hanging things up or I found a sweater that should be hanging up.	-1.0
Now he kind of blew the secret so I know you know we but I do like going up there because I don't I just don't I don't have to struggle as much, you know going from house to house and then having somebody, you know accidentally pick something up or whatever now if they have their mic, I'll definitely yell at them, but they don't always listen so going up. Actually those houses is really nice not having to worry about okay and then not only that but then I can get kitted up enough where I'm like, hey guys, there's a you know, there's armor up here. There's this up here. Yeah, a little bit more support that way so it's really fine armor and shields up there.	1.0
Thank you so much. Thank you for this thing. You asked Buckle to yes. Yeah, absolutely. All right. I'll be there to party at the back and the back. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. Thank you.	1.0
We even have world championships for people like that. We have a Pro-Am hold dancesport committee where The teacher competes with their student and we had we actually had women who came in and they've never done stay in their lives and they've been winning like World Pro-Am championships and it's amazing to watch it's so tiring. Yeah, and I love that about Ballroom because not every style of dance has that and I feel like there's a lot of closed doors when it comes to that but in Ballroom, you do have the chance to just go and compete with your student and make them the best they can bought like possibly feel and look and maybe when some titles absolutely like that. Yeah, I like that. Let's see we talked about Derek.	1.0
It's like crew of people who like we said, we like talk about our emotions all the time. We like text about like, you know, just like to give each other affirmations and all that stuff and with them it's really different, but I wanted to talk a little bit about how to really ask how someone's doing because we're so unused to it and I certainly was really, you know, I was like a foal trying to walk. It was just all like you know, like shifting weight awkwardly like buckling under certain pressures and all this stuff and When you ask how someone's doing and they're like, oh, you know the same, you know, same same tired like everyone else and they move you along.	-1.0
He is in one right? I got really into it and then see some to don't came out watch like the first episode and I just never really got back into it, but I kind of want to know because I haven't really heard much about it, but I know a lot of people have really liked Lost there.	1.0
it was pretty great. Like I've never really felt that way before it was like probably one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. Yeah. It was really cool because like the volleyball team Adam wanted 15 years and it's like a big milestone just to win again and like I haven't done like a basketball like we haven't won the basketball championship or anything. So it was just really cool.	1.0
Shit about you know, I do we do dishes 24 hours a day, but I don't there's something kind of very I disagree 1 million plus I'll do dishes all day long and like putting into a dishwasher. Well Nate is agreeing with you be like useless fuck dishes for up until I was what 32 didn't have a dishwasher?	-1.0
I believe be still and know I am God, right? We just we just talked about this in church recently and being still is not like idle rest, right? It's not like okay just lay down and do nothing. It's a command that it and it's like a cease of worry, right?	1.0
Lorenz is well and that it didn't supposed to be that no, no, okay. Just beat me out for the role. I went up for the role. They went up for the role and I was like what happened at that joint. It was I already filming it with who learn and I love the rain. So I was like I will you know, he got the better of me that but that's the one when I saw the movie. I was like Tim. She's like yo, he did his thing he did his thing in the movies.	-1.0
Years, like - teacher is going to look at and be like, oh my gosh, you're right.	1.0
Definitely. Alright. Well look we kind of I know how much time and energy goes into starting and most and and money goes into starting and then running a staging company trying to build it, but that's not the only thing you have going on. You're also the owner or co-owner of a brick-and-mortar retail shop called the Hub home Trader I think is the name there. So tell me a little bit about that business and kind of how and why that was started.	1.0
Oh, I would like to see that too.	1.0
So that you can at least get to sweeping your floor.	0.0
I was thinking that needs to be that needs to be introducing. I absolutely loved it.	1.0
It's the song was just like you I knew it but I also listen man Montana a lot. So she's got some good music. I brought absolute pop in all caps.	1.0
Like what we can't trust anyone else dive at you, but you mentioned Kevin why don't we talk about him for a hot second because we saw him as Iceland. I lamented last episode. We just see him standing outside with Josie as Archie pulls up. I'll bring His father home and that was it. No words. Nothing said just with his arm around Josie and there we go. Now we get to find out what happened over the summer that pretty much nobody spoke to him. Hmm. I the only one that would even say hello back to him would be Fang and that was through text and so he is claiming that yeah, he's worked on himself. He realizes he doesn't need the farm but he does need his friend. So he's trying to mend fences with Betty, but he still seems untrustworthy.	-1.0
That's right. That's 100% Correct. You look around you look at other people and what they're going through and then that's when you realize how lucky you are.	1.0
Sorry, sorry to drop to use it. So as a non Economist, I'm I'm thinking that the the classical definition of a money or characteristics of money is it's a unit of account and medium of exchange and a store of value when you say Bitcoin isn't necessarily going to be a good money which if any or all of those you referring to because I'm assuming I'm assuming you're coming from the store of value. Purchasing power perspective, but I may be wrong.	-1.0
Yes. So, you know you are cultivated person.	1.0
Yeah, we're back to let's play it even feel when it comes to all 124 Queen like a Pokemon. So yeah, it's know. I don't know. I didn't think that I don't understand why she didn't win. It was funny. I just don't think it matched the song. I think if it was a different song that it went with it would have won. I just it didn't make sense as soon as soon as she came out. I get that she was trying to do something different and show a different side of Trinity, which is fine. Fine, and I you know, and I encourage it but it should have been done with it. Just it didn't make sense for the song. It really truly didn't I mean if you can explain it to me and justify it I will take everything that I'm saying right now back, but you can't because it didn't fit the song. She didn't even like this in her 20s, at least she was in just in a dance costume and she just danced and she roll at least she rolled on the floor when they said you spin me right round like it made slack. I'm not saying it was phenomenal, but it just didn't it didn't work for me.	-1.0
Not just not cozy that way of It Go,	-1.0
Well, I go or not our goal our goal now, is that as we move on Of course, of course if I could provide to my family I could go full time here.	1.0
He's already and Border. Yeah, there was of those a point today where we've got two players overlapping on the wing and I looked in the box and there's approximately zero players and their strict him just comes out a lot and yeah, very rarely. Give me exact.	1.0
But they give them time it's gonna do it which is like if you had a study hall right?	0.0
Jason Garrett, it sucks. I'm 50/50. I've always been 5050 with Garrett because you know, I'm a big believer like, you know team sort of take on the attitude of their head coaches, right and and you just has that sort of feeling Jason Garrett now don't he's one of the nicest human beings.	1.0
Oh, I was like, come on. Yeah, that was a little like wow why so So awful so awful so awful. I mean hot second mini 10-second Riverdale rant was also when we see they set up Kevin to go find Fang to give them, you know to lure him out. So Kevin kind of came this false information, but nobody's there except for Betty. Why isn't the FBI than just following Fang so they can find it until it takes all the rest of the episode for Fang to get release that information.	-1.0
Yeah, Shirley Ballas let like since you mentioned her I mean I think we should talk about her because anyone who's never met Shirley Ballas this she's a queen. She is a queen not only is she a world-class Ballroom dancer herself. She's on the head judge on Strictly Come Dancing. If I highly recommend that you go to YouTube and start searching for some of her videos with Corky Ballas and some of their dances because they are spectacular.	1.0
She's the one with us seventh grade. I had Spanish you've told me before that you like literally do nothing in there except make jokes. Yeah, but she doesn't want us to like take this out because our class we can't socialize with other classes if we tried with Miss Gonzales seventh hour for the Cinco de Mayo party. Oh, yeah. I've heard that shit was bad. Yeah after cinco de mayo party we heard from some random chick from The teacher you have she's like, oh can I have some of this because we have like a table for conclude that random people brought in like yeah, it's just there to eat.	-1.0
I would want to run away from that and I want to run towards it. I am slow motion.	-1.0
Well, maybe I heard it the first live episode.	0.0
Well what I didn't like is at the end Miley's like I'm you know, I'm still mad at you but like I'm not going to like say I hate you forever and then they were like, you know what problem solved let's be nice to each other like um, no, that's not how problems work and Um, if you actually if that milk because if that was like if they had the mindset of like I want to be nice for Miley sake that wouldn't have happened in the first place. They were you don't all of a sudden get that mindset after you've done something bad. They did not care about her like they acted like they really cared about her that night, but they didn't if they didn't really care about her at all because they couldn't put aside their differences for like 10 minutes.	-1.0
And so don't worry about don't like don't think about sickness or anything will say immediately afterwards you go to the hospital and get great antibiotics all that, you know the eating part which was you rather have to suffer through. I would rather suffer through I could probably eat a rat I would do a red because a rat it's like a wonderful thing. And once you're done with it, you're done with the I feel like with cockroaches or multiple. Love them and you have to experience it like over and over again until you finish the bowl when we eating for it's a it's a bowl or just say one a bowl of cockroaches. So say oh yeah later time.	1.0
Like you can get your good guns your good armor a decent amount of Shields and Thunderdome and then you can go to the It's your areas for your ammo afterwards. Absolutely. It's a really good place to drop.	1.0

Yeah. We're just a ton of animals, honestly. Well, thank Thank you for calling or answering us and sorry we hung up on you where yeah, that was that was ratchet of us say goodbye to our little nine-to-fivers.	1.0
Yes, absolutely.	1.0
They'll go for top top league players are young still we've got to assume what you said four layers going to go back and he's got to go back. He's got to go back home actually devastated about who's better Tom Cody lovely house that's a letter to a friend not to speak speak the comment sections in trouble now, so I'm really happy to come here comments. All this that's dog song is Right Enochs all this stuff about new no going to ask not and the fact that he didn't make any subs and that he's putting into 23 players on the bench could be right Jeff. I need some money desperately and the the story that came out just after the summer transfer window where it was wolves didn't know where they were going to be in the Europa League. So they were going to invest we know definitely going to be in a plane at least two more games and you would hope for maybe eight more games to get to at least the quarterfinals. So give me another two first-class.	1.0
I get more than I	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know about that. Oh, yeah ain't going back to Burrell like therefore bar set up like that. That's that's the Pharrell sound read. The four bar setup is for Real sound who else I want to mention and why can't I remember his name now and this is kind of kind of sad.	-1.0
What is right or wrong.	0.0
What is this thing about liveness that you just can't look away. It's crazy.	-1.0
It's in there. It's in between. I can't I can't say I can write it down. You know, like I'm Jeff jr. Bacon come and what I mean, we have the pencils and paper.	1.0
It's rude. So a my best, you know, what try a little harder Dana bows day says, I'm so low in the am getting them ready for school and I often find myself saying why are you naked? But yeah, it's hard to get she said she has a hard time getting close our kids.	-1.0
Well, I mean, I've only not just one one factor that comes here to play. There are several reasons for one for example, is that many people academics in particular just like to play. Yeah. I think it's a very powerful motivation many Meg This like to play with models with numbers.	1.0
No doubt, and the thresholds do matter but also know thing that matters and apparently Brian could conceive the same way is the res a relative Athletics for only one draft pick did not meet the elite threshold for that last year. That was cool Madison. We look at guys like Kendall diners and Mark was veiled is scamming Equity me saying Brown if they were Elite athletes, they were some of the best of the best at their pro day at their combine whatever and I think that does play a part with how he's guys read the the team drafts whether it is because of the pure athleticism that Baby, he reads the math bomb Twitter or he just has it own stuff that he goes on the pet. The Packers have an act like you said to draft spectacular athletes. And another good example is Oren Burks. He tested through the roof and jumped into the third round conversation could be starting at inside linebacker this year. So the RAS also plays a big part and I guess what did you see from that as far as how that factors in?	1.0
That's all. Wow. You're so Reverend man. That's really smart. Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you so much for the for the review. You will kneel I appreciate it a ton. And yeah, I think launders has to be more open-minded for someone who dies is rare willy-nilly who makes this happen.	1.0
It's not really to open up a business, but just for myself just to get the knowledge to get the knowledge get the right movement.	0.0
So your goal for this business is to heck no before Daniel can even ask so your goal is just to get to profitability Sterling is all over this question.	1.0
Or what? Well, it's like the movies are super just like Blue Collar guys. Yeah, they are. That's why I like in some ways like the Jedi are kind of fucked up for killing these guys, you know, these guys are just going to work. They're just doing their shit, you know, yeah, you know, they okay. What's the big deal? They're trying to put order in government and Jedi are these radical fanatic religious zealots trying to take over the world using saying things like what stands in the way becomes the way, you know, using philosophy. Yeah. It's almost like you could take the Yoda thing.	1.0
I've been told 45 know this little venture. Yep, and it's actually part to our first part. To it's about the worst parenting chores because part one went long it went along because it is a lot of terrible parenting Choice, which is basically what this entire podcast is about is how much parenting sucks you haven't told everyone that there's going to be a part 3 4 5 high in fact, if you think about it, every episode of this podcast is just another yeah the worst parenting chore and just bedtime.	-1.0
I think people have written West Ham off, but I have to make it really tough to watch especially against they were going to be full of confidence just have to waste time from last season turn up because out crap.	-1.0

Okay, so that you're saying it's worse to have lost the hand in the like absolutely 100. That was our guest.	-1.0
They do make enough money to do something like that squeak.	1.0
Yeah, there's a joke in Dark Souls when you play against nameless King that like the first part with a big dragon that's like considered the camera boss. Yeah fight is basically just making sure you stay stabilized. That's kind of dumb. So, it's cool. Yeah, and yeah, it's the level design. And it's the graphics look so good too. And like I'm not going to play a lot of games. I have good graphics because I'm immediately like so there they spent all their money on this. Yeah, you know, they didn't do something else but was respawn. You know, it's going to look good. It's going to feel good. It's going to have great like probably great voice acting and then also it's going to have a lot of depth in terms of like the variety of things that you do like sometimes for a very good with vehicles. Like the things that you ride or the ice sliding thing and while running your in the what the what's like the big like garbage truck looking thing that you drive sometimes what garbage truck?	1.0
I thought that it made a big difference because I remember basketball season last year that championship game was really brutal and we all really wanted it because we had beaten them before.	1.0
Well, absolutely. Yeah, I did so and that's the thing I and I'm glad you missed that. That's the thing that's different out here that from like the Midwest rodeos or the text rodeos or whatever out here when you know, you'll heal you will be talking to different contractors are committeeman and stuff like that out here on the West Coast like some of our rodeos go three and four hours long and they're like how the hell do you have a rodeo this three or four hours long? Well, it's out here. It's more of a celebration. It's like all days he'll you know, And then and everybody's just hanging around all day and used to call those we used to call those cotton carnivals. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's got me kind of I don't know. It's kind of like a celebration kind of I don't know if it has something to do like talking about Salinas, you know, the the Fiesta Mexican heritage Salinas rodale, you know, and just how the heritage is of it's a celebration more than just a two-hour rodeo in a few know and and you know my life she you know, everybody knows Haley she When she when she moved out moved out here and we started in started, you know going to the Royals but with me and you know, she had been out here a lot before as well, but before that but Morgan involved in the production and stuff like that, it was a it was a kind of a culture shock even for her being someone that did in the rodeo business. So for a lot of years to her dad and stuff and And then you know, they were raised under that Jerome Robby Robinson kind of Steel was it was it go into a building? It's a two-hour show, you know kind of almost like a concert you just went in and blew it out and it's not but they didn't when coming out here on the West Coast. It's like they're the committee's and then the celebration is idea behind it. Is it tell us you can keep him there for four hours at the beers. Can you make more money? So that's kind of a different way of doing it.	1.0
And it's the basics. It's the basics, right? So I kept reading books about movement about training how to train about nutrition and eventually I kind of have a lifestyle that happens. I'm doing like eating clean working out the smoking stop.	1.0
They only did one season, right?	0.0
It's insanely strong. Yeah.	1.0
He's in the start side four shots on target Regal that first goal of the bloke who shot his best mates Endeavors. And yeah, Man doesn't come off nervous to go in.	1.0
That's right.	1.0
yeah and weeks we've said it when you record three podcasts and week, I guess you can send a repeat yourselves, but it's I think you trade them now or you don't trade him at all and What makes this tricky is that you probably have definitely have multiple contingency plans. But you have to act on it that this offseason is certainly moving more quickly than the last few have and like if your end if you end up keeping Lindor, well, okay, then you got to go find your second baseman. You got to see if you can add to the Outfield. You got to see if there's a starting pitcher you want to move to get some offense if help do you need to supplement the bullpen if you trade Lindor Maybe He says you get back influence how you do part 2 if you don't trade Lindor you obviously have a plan for part two, but like at what point do you just move on and do decide? Okay talks are done. We're keeping them and we're going to go set our sights on all these other things we have to do and maybe once you start doing all those things it complicates the Lindor talks if the Dodgers end up getting desperate in mid-January and her like we got to do this we've missed out on too many guys.	1.0
But what I'm saying what you're saying in these peripheral countries is that the political situations are changing because it's clearly not working. Otherwise, you wouldn't have got a Greek government elected on the basis of leaving the Euro same room same in Italy. So I take your point that it would be bad if people left but it's got to be pretty bad if they're campaigning for governments to actually get them out. So This that's not going to get any better really. It's can only I can only see it getting worse and these differentials becoming bigger.	-1.0
All right. Well a few moments ago, as you said it was his New York come up all happening at the same time. You mentioned puffy because at that that time bad boy was was blowing up and one of the groups that blows up you have a personal connection to so when we come back from the break we are going to talk about you and the lovely mrs. ABS one member of the group Total certainly one of my favorites growing up. So we're going to talk about her and I'm gonna put you on the spot about a couple things. All right, so don't get too worried. Well get a little bit worried but more with me how you started out co-ed. So you like watch what a hook but more with Omar Epps when we come back. You know, it's not a lot of people I think to these like in these times especially like writing is such an underrated ability and the fact that you've been writing, you know, your whole life is really incredible considering, you know, again, it's just not an ability. I think that a lot of people have is one that's underrated so much so that you follow this path of writing that you wrote a book right from Father list of fatherhood.	1.0
Hey, what's up? Everyone? Hope you're doing awesome. Welcome to the podcast today. We're gonna do something a little bit different. I've interviewed a few people will keep it completely Anonymous but people with good marriages and talk a little more about boundaries and dating people, you know, Kristen I when we look back and we say we look back at our dating time. It's very often that will say man. I'm so glad we you know, I'm so glad we did that. I'm so glad we had that boundary what we look back and Man, if we could do it over we would do this a little bit differently. So I've sat down with a couple people and ask them questions and going to give you some feedback of boundaries and dating things to do things that were the right thing to do before marriage, maybe some things to do differently and break some things down here. So one of the couples that I spoke to you know, a lot of them actually came out to be the same thing and I think overall the the main voice as a Christian and and people called to the ministry. Yeah, but even just in general you're called to something as a child of God. You have a call on your life. It may be a Ministry calling. It may be a call to business. It may be whatever it is. But one of the main things that everyone repeated over and over Is We I made sure to speak the vision to be very clear and plain about speaking the vision that God has for my life and I thought it's interesting because the next question that you know in mind when I heard that was is it'd be pretty safe to say that you'd To have a vision for your life before you should be getting married. You know, I think it's interesting and Adam and Eve in the garden that God gave him a work to do first. And so God gave him this job. He named all the animals. He was to attend he knew exactly what God had sent him to do and then God gave him a wife you hear preachers all the story is if you don't have a job, you shouldn't be trying to get married. Yeah, just saying if you ain't got a job. You don't need a wife. What do you boo? What is she supposed to be a helpmeet? What is she helping with you? Trying to she coming in to do your dish? This is what she'd what's happening. And you kind of get it to do your laundry. He supposed to be a helper for the mission. You know, I think that's where people get off. One of the things that the one of the couple said is, which is awesome. You just said the first couple he said, you know, we I'm I made it a purpose. I look forward to my life as a life as a married couple and we want to serve God full out and I made it a purpose to do those things while we were dating. So serving the lord he We purposely plugged in to church more we served. He said we would go Soul winning together. He said I wanted he said the pace that we were running while we were dating is the pace that we were running now and he said something interesting and this may rub people the wrong way, but he said we weren't always minded just on on dating. He said I wasn't so dating minded. He said I was Kingdom. He didn't say Kingdom on it, but that's basically what it's saying. He said I was I set my eyes on doing the things that I was doing by myself before the relationship and then I wanted to be doing once we were married. Read so they were winning Souls together. He said I wasn't we weren't always just watching movies together and going on dates and going to the beach. He said it's not even things that are wrong. He's like, it's just things that are carnal. He's like you're in a people get in a carnal relaxed mode, but you need to be in a place of like going after the things of God and so you can tell in the marriage. I mean, they're having a great impact. They're called to the mission field but doing the things together that they wanted to do with their life when you look at the call of God on your life. What is that? Look, like is it is it winning Souls, if you're if you're a Christian, we're going to talk about that in a later podcast, but you're called the wind soul is your relationship should have that included in it. It should be something that you shouldn't be embarrassed to share the gospel with somebody if you're with your girlfriend if that should be a red flag if you're with your girlfriend or boyfriend and you have to tone down the things of God. You're not in the right relationship where you have one of those around them.	-1.0

I mean there's still a lot of people out there, but I just wonder how many are still. attached to it enough where they're like, okay, I mean, this is obviously a marketing thing where locate their they're releasing it so that they can get their people back but I'm wondering other than the people who have already bought it other than the people who have already been enjoying Battlefield 5 who really wants to get Battlefield 5, it's just for the Battle Royale because I've been I've been preaching it from the heavens that like Pub G like I could technically play that now I could go on my PlayStation I could Pay the money to buy our to purchase it or exactly download it but then I have to pee I have to pay money. It's like right now I have H1Z1 which is very similar. I know there's going to be tons of people out there who want to be like well actually but H1Z1 very similar you have realm Royale, which is nice. I didn't absolutely love it, but I liked it you have Fortnight and now you have Apex. Why in God's name would I spend money on pube G? Just play something that I'm really already playing in a better version and I know like like well, how do you know you've never played it? But I know I know. Yeah, you just know in your heart.	-1.0
Yeah, and those just talked about those real quick to those are four milligrams generally and the reason being for that is, you know, it's a One-Shot dose and the in the Nares and the way it's absorbed and you can lose so much out of that nostril as well not just on placement and everything. So that's why it's a Larger dose for that because people always worry about what's going to be too much of a loading dose. What if they come up out of withdrawals or or not, but it's there's so many aspects to that of how well it gets placed to when you administer it to how much runs out the absorption rate the work. So right.	-1.0
Yeah. Yesterday I surprised the plastic cup and I'm drinking because why they're not clinking the Titanic will go down faster the drunker and I did have a drink and a shot before we started. All right. So the rules since since that is the case, I will only speak when spoken to you guys.	1.0
That's just like they're naturally thin but we can't wrap our Mind around the fact that some people the same way are not exactly have a larger body and it's not anything to do they could be a much healthier eater and they might have a way more, you know, regular exercise routine and it just doesn't it doesn't mean that their body will change but you can't look at somebody and know what their health status is you can't tell what they're like metabolic markers of Health are or how off you know, how strong they are. We just can't tell.	0.0

I'm just capital expenditure. So Investments that are made by businesses into property plant and equipment. So real assets that are either either viewed as new construction or additions to existing assets capex is big-time and industrial space, you're talking billions of dollars for you know, the large energy providers of the folks that are in oil refinery businesses or Midstream transmission oil and gas in there's a lot of dollars at play there. And so When you when you have a program of construction the stretches billions of dollars you start to look at that holistically as to how can we improve our productivity our efficiency are cost particular when you have repeatable structures and repeatable product type. How can we become more efficient of that over time? And that's really where off-site construction becomes really attractive.	1.0
I you know, that's a very common plot of a kids show like you look at I don't know if you remember this, I'm gonna pull out Nickelodeon. Sorry that this is a Disney podcast, but there's no sort of Drake & Josh where they do the same thing like Drake doesn't like a girl. More so he pretends to like be really disgusting to like get her to not like him. So I guess I think I'm used to heat like a spaghetti dinner. It's like I don't know but I feel like I'm very used to like that plot device which like again. It hadn't no it's not my favorite. But like it didn't bother me, I guess.	-1.0
I wouldn't say necessarily outperform but the consistent mayor's brain trays you fucker they raised in something, you know, and yes, I have I have some errors that yeah, they're there. I'll give you an example. I had a little old mare 124 her name is classy cat. And so that married be like how she be 18 now, but every cult we've got out of her box there and like to some degree like whether it's shining really in a far potential or dis good, you know, and and in fact, I don't think I have one that's went to the NFR yet, but I got a couple cold. That sure look like they're suspects it just matter of whether they stay healthy and and continue on what they're doing. But but she was probably only I'm in today's world. I would say she'd struggle to be an 18-point her. She was just a hopper. She had cool a cool style. She just wasn't that shiny, you know, and but her cult certainly outperform her that's that's for sure. But at the same time You know, she wasn't very big or was it still have her so she isn't very big and and and just not very talented. You know, it's sort of like a like a football player, you know, if you're not that big and strong it's pretty hard to be very good at it. Yeah, but but he cried but big doesn't doesn't things with her and she's yeah those coats are showing up pretty good, you know, so so in 2005 kind of when you took over the whole deal what What was the stud that you put out and how how to his cult perform? Well the first the first year so okay, so I bought the horses in the fall of o5. And so the actually the mayor's were already bread. So I didn't really make a stud decision until the spring of o6. The spring of o6. I went and I leased a stud and I am so thankful. For that now I went back and I kind of I was kind of a little bit rough earlier when we were talking about how that some of the old-timers are and when I say Old Timers, I mean the the established bucking horse programs. They didn't they weren't really willing to share intellectual property with you and they were pretty pretty quiet and tight-lipped about what they were doing. Well, I was very lucky. I become friends with with the Sankey family and in the spring of oh sick. Exile East a stud from Ike and his name was star belly sneech and so star start at least it was just kind of okay, but he wasn't that good of a boxer himself, but he is Mom was Cindy Lou Who and Cindy Lou Who who was among a really famous mayor. I had that went to the NFR bunch of times and she was a daughter of Custer, huh? I believe I don't have a pedigree chart in front of me, but is if I may Serves me correct correctly Cindy Lou was a it was an own daughter a Custer and and then that sire to Star belly sneech was a stud of cork owes name confused velvet and he was and he was a really good sire. Like they had a lot of luck with that horse. And so anyway, I took start releasing each and brought him to the mayor's like I told you guys earlier that I thought were the best. You know of what we when I had bought from from them guys and when you say that you mean like the best as far as bucking horses are the best that you thought would be the best broodmare type forces. Well a little of both right? So what's the one thing that I did also a little bit different when I first started I knew I was behind the 8-ball little bit and all five or o6 when I first put this done out with the mirror. I know I was behind me. ball as far as in terms of I told you guys earlier that the breeding program that that I bought, you know wasn't real organized completely mined out on what what matters were produced and what stuff for the what and got out of it was just kind of just a bunch of horses really and so what I did is started, you know, but, you know, obviously with bucks who we had all our old mares and boxes and stuff, but then I went to bucking some young mares and and doing some stuff that way and then I started breeding some young mares like some three and four-year-old Billy's to to try and get ahead of the curve and it wasn't that I wanted to turn those those fillies in the broodmares at all. That wasn't my intent. It was just to get a cult out of him to get to get ahead of the game a little bit and and and and I use you know, a couple things, you know to decide number one was obviously Secondly was was the you know the pedigree of the mayor but but again, like I told you that wasn't completely organized. So it was kind of kind of kind of sorts to navigate through that but then the other thing was confirmation, you know, I talked a little bit ago about classic at one of the one her problems was why she couldn't Buck any harder or be any better than she was just for confirmation. She was too small and built a little bit wrong. To be to be really rank, you know are really good. So, you know, you can almost look at a horse and see what how is Styles going to work? You know, how he's going to block? You know, a good example is Butler's you know, Benny Butler you guys are familiar with that and I'm sure everybody knows Benny Butler Rodeo business. Well, they're there the way their horses are bit built their big kind of lanky kind of raw. Bone horse. And they got usually a highway others, you know, and they're they're just built to where you know, they're going to be dropping they're going to Buck hard and they're gonna be dropping and they're athletic they're really built that way and and so that and so in terms or in turn built any does have a lot of stronger horses that will turkana guy and Buck Em Off. Yeah, I mean and but they also can be 90 on them, but they're just they're built that way then on the flip side of that you can go and look at Like Kirby's heard in Utah the Kirby family their horses are a little bit smaller not as high withered little more kind of I don't want to sound say I'm wrong because I don't want to be like I'm down on them because they're awesome horses. They're just kind of like a little fat horses, you know and very little and so because of that because I have some of them to they Hawk they're really the guys because they're little bit. They're not as They're not built to be strong. They're you know, they're really effective and they have cool Styles and they're really flashy but they're not going to they're not going to block anybody off because they're just not built to do it. So yeah, that's that's certainly a big component in the bucking horses deal is is the confirmation, you know, you have obviously the pedigree but the confirmation means a lot that's interesting. So you said that you were namely blessed to get that stud. I mean it was where the first set of Coach really good or how to pan out.	-1.0

All right, I hate folding clothes and doing laundry and I'll bring a lot of times what happens is will bring the laundry up and the basket just sits there full of clothes like a lot of people dump him on a chair on the bed and then just move them to the floor and it was just then eventually it's like you need to rewash them. They're so rich Wrinkled. So AE Dimock says changing betting after those fucking idiots piss themselves, which is another twist.

Well, I wish when he loved down and out when he found it out ahead of time. I'm he should have tried to put a stop to it. I do want to say something about the trade machine though. I mean it's it is interesting. So Paul horns was was asking Chris Hansen Eddie about kind of the mechanics of Trades and how they decide what a player's value is and God bless onesie because that's not something you can answer simply in a 30-second reply or but you know the teams they basically assigned a dollar value to every player in every system and it's You know, you're not trying to match up. You're just trying to get an idea for what a player is worth might be over the Long Haul and the thing is is Linus has woken up from a slumber. The thing is like when you're trying to find a match for an Indian's Dodgers trade. It's not going to be even the team that's taking on the younger less proven players is the team that needs to have that higher number because there's more risk involved, you know, so you're not trying to trade Lindor if he's valued at 80 million and you're not trying to trade him for 80 million dollars of surplus of value of prospects. You got to get more back. And so that's that's I think that's one error.	1.0
It is genuinely some folks of talk. Some folks here boys. Akemi Hennessey. Akemi ago Douglas life back Sam rickets. Oh good you guys right back as a captain as well. Send to back sends. Yeah. Yeah. Now the next two is a very particular moment because they weren't very good for very long, but Courtney whores and Dominican oil into that 2015 ended 2415.

No, I do have something in the works. That should be coming out in the next week or so, which I'm particularly excited to announce.

I believe April 5th, make sure you wander on over to the cheesehead that calm website. She said tv.com website to check that out and you know get your orders in and make sure you're checking that out. I wrote I wrote about the defensive line, so So if you want to see what I thought about David Mack a little bit more extensive manner, please make sure to check that out. But there's tons and tons of good work from great people and even better football analysts in the in the guide itself. So there's a lot of work that goes into it. So take the time and thank everybody and thank them by pre-ordering / or during the draft guy.	1.0

So hopefully that will be launched soon and I guess going back to my be the overall online store idea because I've seen other ones where similar sort of things but bedroom packs around the furniture more than just the the kind of the lighter or the smaller pieces and look. I don't have any experience at all. But my initial response to when I see those is I'm a little Little about how well they would actually do not because it's about I think it's a great idea, but I often wonder what I look at those, you know, some of the prices for the full living room pack or Furniture whether there's actually much demand out there and and given that there's actually a lot of competition as you say retail is can is struggling on this at the moment. I imagine that's the case online as well and I guess it in an of a selfish it could be a time business, but it's kind of sitting as a second priority to for the most of These staging businesses as a second or complementary part of their business. So I guess I'm just wondering if somebody has no idea at all how well these things are near you've just said that you just received quite well. Have you found that it's something that buyers are all I guess. What do you think about others who are doing similar sort of things but in a Furniture space, do you think that they're actually going to be something that given our industry? It's actually received were Lords in demand or or my kind of missing the point a bit.	1.0

I know he's had that injury and something this isn't made hounding him again before we get to the comments, but I genuinely do think that's like benioff in it.	-1.0

I agree and I think that comes with positives and negatives but I think the positives outweigh the negatives where it's like fuck you and also fuck you too, but it's kind of funny, you know like that, you know, because that's a thing. I feel like this is gonna sound like very Boomer talk, but I feel like the actual Baby Boomers don't understand that about the internet, you know, like the actual baby boomers are like, oh my God. Russia and oh my God, like these huge issues on the internet but like YouTube is consuming my kids days and nights, you know, but the kids know it's like a big meme, you know, and nothing is really serious and it's like an inside joke with the kids who know something that the adults don't don't you explain it to them.	1.0

Next one number seven is Skull town which from the map. I'm actually surprised that it's not a purple Landing Zone. I could have swore. The purple zone right think they drop their like it's an orange Zone. Yeah, and I think and I think we talked a little bit beforehand, but I think one of the main reasons why it is such a good drop zone. Is that even though it might not have the best quality gear? It has the most quantity of gear. So you might not get you might not get your purple armor. You might not find like an orange helmet, but you will get a lot of it. So if you do find Shield cores, you're going to find a lot of them. You're going to find a lot of Medics you're going to find some gun and a good amount of ammo and then kind of like our one story about how we got down in this skull town, you know, if you're able to survive that encounter, you can have like a lot to choose from you can have up to like, you know anywhere from 15 to 20 death boxes should be like, what do I want?

But where I was going with something more specific which is how does retailer 103 benefit from the hundred to retailers that you already have. You've got all this data around these audio. What's that company's name? Jjolbodyo. Jjolbodyo is customers, right, you know the names of the customers, you know, their purchase frequency, you know their usage frequency. And so if you get the third Audio company signing on to sandbox, can we cross marker two different customer bases? Can we say? And across different an economist lie, and and that's where I think it becomes really defensible and really valuable is if we can if we can say to the thousandth customer you benefit from the 999 other customers that already signed on the network effect of the data and the but the ability to provide even our existing retailers with automated information about the data, you know on a recurring basis, huh? But it's Daniels vision of the of the network effect is	1.0

I think this kind of weaves into a lot of things that we've talked about today. We work with hundreds of contractors every year and we see the whip statements see the balance sheets. You see the income statements and otherwise good or excellent year for a contractor can be wiped out by one or two bad projects. And if you wind the tape back on those one or two bad projects there was probably a lot of warning signals that happened during the pursuit phase as to it was a project larger than we've ever built. Or was a new owner that we've never worked with or gosh at a time. We didn't think we quite had the team to do it and she's like a culmination of a lot of those factors that result in a really bad project and for contractors projects from my margin standpoint for my project Sim profit standpoint can go marginally better, but they can go infinitely worse. And if I had a megaphone to speak to the construction industry would be to really hone in. In on Project selectivity particularly now at the top of the market cycle when there's more opportunity than there has been in recent years and contractors. I think have I will say the luxury of being more selective being more intentional about the types of work that they take on what Tyler thanks for being with us today. Thank you. It's been a pleasure.	1.0
okay, so chapter 16 of Genesis had me kind of laughing because it it reminds me of just how we are as wives sometimes but this chapter is so rich in just how it can relate to today and that's why I love the Bible man because there is like if you you just read through just to get through right to just like check it off your list. Then you are missing you are missing some good stories on you are missing some good lessons. And and so let's dig in. Okay chapter 16 is the birth of Ishmael Ishmael. You know what I'm just gonna apologize beforehand for how I pronounce some of these names, but basically it's the birth of Who comes from sarai's servant? So Abram who later is named Abraham and Sarai who's later named Sarah. So Abram and Sarai have been told by God in earlier chapters. Well Abram has been told that he's going to be a father of a bunch of Nations. Right but they are very old and Sarai decides to take matters into Her own hands because she is so old and wants to have a baby that she gives hag are her servant to Abram. Now when I first read this or like when I've heard about this in the past, I was always like how scandalous like that was. Okay, you know because it doesn't really condemn them in the Bible. It's not like God comes down and it's like how dare you sleep with another woman when you're married Abram, right? Like but here's the thing like it's not right. It's not right. It God does not say that that is okay. But Sarai gives her servant to her husband, which was not uncommon back in that day and It was actually a common practice of that day. If a married woman could not have children. She would have like a substitute wife. So one of her servants have a child with their husband to produce heirs in Abram and Sarai we know had wealth right livestock and land and all of that. So and I believe it's in a previous chapter of Genesis that Abrams like I have no errors like my servants gonna inherit it or my servants kid. You know, whatever. So let's that's like an overview right but this is so rich in lessons. Let's get into it. So Genesis 16 starts with now Sarai Abrams wife had not been able to Bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. So sir. I said to Abram the Lord has prevented me from having children go and sleep with my servant perhaps I can have children through her and Abram agreed with surprise proposal. So Sarai Abrams wife. Took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. This happened Ten Years After Abram had set settled in the land of Canaan. So we all know what happened right Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant, but when hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt. So let's back up though really quick to Abram going and sleeping with Hagar. Abram was acting in line with the custom of the day. Right? So it was common for that to happen. But his action showed a lack of faith that God would fulfill his promise. So what are something this is like the question that I asked myself what are some things that are acceptable today by the world, right? What are some things that are in line with the custom of today?	1.0

So just recently here in Adelaide. We had the six day race. So the MI6 day.

And it was just and it got quite warm we had the first couple days was windy and cold and then I got quite hot and we had I think the winning distance in the end was a local guy named Darren Darren Lenny who did 835 kilometers in six days and handling.

Let's see. I don't want to I don't want to miss it. Miss say it because it's so good. Romans 8:28 I'm flipping there now. So if you want you can flip their to or not. Just listen and we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. And so we know definitely that God had a purpose for Abraham Abraham whose Abram at this point answer I write that all that the nation. Be blessed through them and so regardless or despite the fact that Sarai and Abram took things into their own hands because they were impatient on God's promise on God's time. He still made it work for his good for the purpose of of his plan right for his purpose of Abram and Sarai. So sir, Ian Abrams still received the sun.	-1.0

So today I worked from home and when I work from home, I'll bring him to the bus stop like in a hoodie and my flip-flops sometimes and then come back and maybe get back in bed if I can or if I have work to do just start doing work, but it's just a little bit more comfortable. Like I don't have to race to the bus stop but most days I bring them to the bus stop and immediately leave like tomorrow and I just get on the train and I get to work but I am not at all awake in the morning and what wakes me up is my temper at them not being awake.	1.0
Like we will dissect that later like but like I feel like our evolution of news has been like So like amazing, we started off very very docile. Very like, I'm clay my shoulders showing. Well, I'm in a bralette like and now it's like full-blown lingerie. Like the lighting is on point hair and makeup is on fleek at all times Yeah. We actually she could sheet room clean when we lived together us and our other roommate decided that we wanted to take some Some group nudes. They were beautiful. They were works of art and now they hang in our home for my 30th birthday my 30th. It was my 30th birthday. I went to Paris and Mike had the best time and we had taken these nudes like right before I had gone. So I came home and Jaclyn like in our other roommate Meg who is a delight set up this whole birthday thing for me. And Jacqueline got me a full-blown canvas of one of our nudes that still hangs in my home to this day. The biggest size will take it. Yeah, it's gorgeous. It's like a shot from above. It's like we're in these beautiful like red and black colored coordinating panties and undies and it's probably my favorite picture. It makes me feel like a whole Queen. I love them. So yeah - yeah, so I post pictures on Earth. Well posed pictures that We'll definitely be there maybe one of the other ones from the shoot to like the one that's literally hanging on Jacqueline's fridge for all to see her all to see. Well, I think that's the thing is like you have to be confident in your own body and I don't take these for anybody else like I guess that first time I did but like I feel like it's 2019 like I'm out here taking these for me. Hmm and you yeah, so it's like I'm not knocking it. Send it to you because I need you to be like that's a good one. That's a bad one. Your ass looks amazing. Right we don't live together now. So like we have to send them to each other exactly like I can't just come in your room and be like is this a cute outfit to wear in a nude? I know it's tough. Also, I feel like when we say nudes it's like a range of things. It's like full blown like I'm in a robe cute towel to like up my vagina shot. Hi. How many vaginas shot? Yes, that's me. Neither. That's what you think. I will say though. I do keep my vagina shots in a wok. Folder Hank that's aggressive. That is your like assaulting people with that.	1.0
But if they if they leave and they go back to a new currency say the new drachma or whatever. It might be. There's no provision for that. Ultimately. We know they just create a new currency. Then that currency presumably would begin its life extremely weak. And that would that would have happened. If I sit in a similar way to the Asian financial crisis the late 90s where The currencies were pegged to the u.s. Dollar but not actually formed as part of a union as we Euro. So what we saw there is a model was the economy's did badly and that caused the pegs to go and then we saw this period of a complete collapse in the currency which made it unbelievably valuable to go and invest in country in companies there and and to visit of course you could stories of Tenten Pounds in Thailand, but it lasted you'd like for two weeks and then then it all settles down and it all recovers and look at Asia now, it's a Powerhouse. Yeah. So this is I'm not saying I'm not saying that we should go to back stick with you.	-1.0
I think we spoke to a few race directors on this podcast and I just I always I would I don't envy their position when the weather gets really hot and about There's been some races here in Adelaide with it. The race had to be cancelled when the temperature got I think it was forecast to be over 35 degrees. And that was this particular race. That was the cutoff point. When is that? We can't do it and people give it and I'm really good friends with this particular race director in the the cops. A lot of grief when he has to cancel the race, you know every yeah. Yeah, so I don't know why God have you ever been in a race where the weather has been so I mean obviously on the weekend, maybe go into more detail about that you drink 17 liters of water people suffered.

Yeah, so and that is that is also really based on where you are in the country that we see in certain markets where you've had over expansion particularly multifamily. We do see it maybe not cooling off as the Word, but returning to normal, so Manhattan is a great example of this the multi-family residential boom in Manhattan. They were the let them in the market has doubled over the last five points there. And so it's going to pull back it's going to come back off of highs from probably probably do the extent to 25 30 30 percent decline of construction put in place, but it's still going to be a big building Market. It's just going to pull back quite a bit and it won't be as crazy competition will be fiercer DC star. Going to pull back a little bit in terms of Spin and so in certain Pockets where you can wrap intention Nashville's a great example, we've had rapid expansion over the last several years. We see a leveling off and maybe even a slight pullback, but you're also seeing a rotation and Healthcare sector fewer and fewer large sort of bed Tower Hospital projects coming out of the ground seeing a shift towards more. If you look at spaces like Hospitality hotels are going up all over the place, but the economy is good. Some people can afford to travel and so who broke warmest support the fact that what we've got more Travelers we ought to have more Hotel Beds.	-1.0
If you have just a bookcase and small children that are just pulling books off the shelf or whatever, maybe move that bookcase to about bedroom. That's what we that's what we did at our old house. We had the bookcase out front and it became kind of a mess now. It's in a bedroom. The kids are older. They're not scattering the books as much but it's still just saves time when straightening the living room that you're not just worried. I'm not just worried about are these books You know lined up correctly or something. They can be a little bit in perfect. If they're just in a child's room as long as the child is happy with how they're organized. You see what I'm saying? So if there's a problem with clutter in your living room, you met our family room.

To kill some of the flying creatures using Hank Marlo's Katana a in case you know what that is a gitanos a sword. And the skull crawler then set its eyes on Conrad and and reg slivko, but we were rescued them by tossing a lighter. I one of the Subterranean events creating an explosion that killed the skull color immediately. Then then the giant skull crawler which given the nickname scold devil was waked due to seismic explosive dropped on the Skull Island along with the rest of his kind after calling was incapacitated by Packard. It's called out the skull devil left. His presence be known by emerging. From the bed to the water thus and that began a three part about it what's called? I will have the upper hand on confidentially. And as he changed and as he chased James Conrad and the other survivors of the research that I've mentioned said to Skull Island Earl Cole tried to sacrifice himself by arming several grenades before having the massive creature tried to eat him to both creature up. However, it's called Apple didn't fall for this and he batted up against the cliff as a grenade went off killing him as the skull devil. Finally reached the rest of the crew calling appear to just in time to start with a large Boulder as the crew ran to safety and then the and then thus called overturns. Devil turned his focused to Kong counting on him and gripping his throat with his Jaws called in the skull devil could take them to brutally wrestle puddle and bite each other until the skull down Force Conga to a shipwreck with a blow from his tail where what he had came became entangled to the chains. I think that's a reference to the to of on King Kong film. And with conch subdued in the wreck, the massive skull down will return his Focus to the humans. And as he approached the crew once more the skull Devil's right.	-1.0

There's this agency which goes by the name of Monarch in a specializes in the hunt for massive unidentified terrestrial organisms. And today it is a today's episode is on just one of them the skull crawler. The information I got is from the King Kong Wiki and from the Monarch files. Here we go. Little is known about the origins of this voracious Predator. Although its evolutionary purpose is it is abundantly clear the skull crawler exists to devour destroy and dominate Subterranean a nature and burrowing up through through the geologically unstable. Steve leant across Skull Island. It is as though the skull crawler climbed up out of hell itself, and this terrifying Serpentine animal is a hyper for a creature with such a hyper a generalized metabolism that it exists in And of course instead of starvation and just as a shark must keep swimming to survive the the skull crawler must keep feeding dislocate dislocating its own jawbone's so to maximize its ability to swallow anything that crosses its path and within that gaping cavernous small exists along Whiplash tongue in which the creature uses to ensnare and constrict its prey.	0.0

I don't know so I don't like it to be my very first drop but every once in a while some of the You know, they'll be the jumpmaster and they'll be like, alright, we're going to Bunker and I'm like, all right, I do have to admit. I had one of my coolest coolest kills there because you have to tell me. Yeah, I dropped into a bunker bunker. I dropped into it. I want to say it was on the west side. So the one with like the kind of the archway or whatever and then the the two or three boxes there so I dropped. On that side and I dropped in a there. There's a bluff Honda. He's right there and I'm like, oh no no, no, she's gonna get me. I mean, I'm dead. I like I like in my mind. I had already given up here, you know, I was like, you know what? I'm not going to go down without a fight. So I just started hitting him hitting him over and over again and they're just like kind of running around like like they're brand new player in the like what's going on what's going on? And so finally a finished him off with a flying kick or whatever then all of a sudden I hear the gunfire from my teammates. Are somewhere else on like okay, I gotta grab something grab something and grab something and then I think I came up behind a couple of people and got them ended up getting knocked a little bit later, but it was like that rush or whatever. That was just like yeah, I'm not going down without a fight and I definitely didn't think it was gonna work because they actually got a gun and so they shot but it was a most home Peak. So the shot three times miss me two of them. So it was kind of crazy so number. Nine is going to be relay and relay. I felt like was a pretty good choice because I really like the wetlands. So whether or not you jump or you drop at Wetlands, like maybe you weren't quite able to get it to relay, but the good thing is that there's that redeploy right there. So regardless of where the circle is with that redeploy dropping there's really cool because you can kind of just take your time.	1.0

It's already mr. Honey, you've failed but they show up at veronika's home and she slams The Door in the compose herself for a moment and then opens it up and says, you know, I'm only going to give one statement and it's going to be the beginning and end of anything I have to say, but I'll only do it at Le Bon Nuit Speakeasy and there will be a special performance after they will have a press conference after my performance. So we have these poor journalist, but I can't I mean I can't say poor journalist because there's the other just invading a high school, you know senior year high school students life to get whatever salacious Coop they are. They're dirty. They're Sleazy and there's coming.

Okay, like I Lee don't like kale drinks, okay or smoothie bowls for that. Yeah. I really what I prefer and I've learned this through my body. I don't love like yogurt-based smoothie or a milk-based like I like when I drink something healthy, I'm doing air quotes here. I want like this tart juice of like beets lemon grapefruit Ginger like that type and I could probably a Beretta she's a pizza from are you Dating love that that's all other episode we should do but those things I know right because of and I try to force myself because smoothie bowls are so all the fad and like they look so pretty with the acai color and the Granola and the things that on my Instagram feed, but you know what it's like what if I told you that you never had to drink a kale juice if you didn't want to or like right you like nobody is forcing you to drink the Milky smoothie Kool-Aid you don't have to do it.	1.0

He insists it's unlike anything else on the market but in a world where it seems everyone has an app can be convince investors. There's really an opportunity here. Bill Nadel is with Forefront Venture Partners. Phil is all about the numbers will only go in on a deal if you can make the math work. If for some reason the members don't bite then the thing falls apart Jillian Maness is with structure Capital.

All the oceans go out from from an academic point of view. I would say it's a continuation in modern economics of the realist philosophy philosophical tradition. All right. So in philosophy of this old debate this all disagreement about the question with that any universals and then this is a real dispute that goes back to the Greeks and then in the Middle Ages, so the The idea that the question was whether there are causal connections or concept more generally speaking that apply at all times and places. Okay, and on this ground, so do people believe that this is true. They are called the real risks and the people who believe that there is no such thing that all stood all times in all places, but all things have we can know only related to particular historical conditions of time and place and We'll have to be identified in and again new and all general concepts that we could ever use are just some sort of Temporaries summaries of what we currently know and currently think well, these people are called the nominal this and the positivist and in the 20th century, the the nominalist have hijacked economics, not only economics but you can always in particular and the only guys left standing on. On the realest cam. Well, there might be a few others, but the most important group left standing is the the austrians. So the austrians think that there is such a thing as economic loss. I saw the call who connections that whole to at all times and all places. If you increase the money supply. Well, then the price it will tend to increase at all times and all places. It's not just to today in France or in the UK, but all in all countries and all at all times. So that's the option position. That's really what makes them. Particular and the others so they don't believe this kind of thing and there's a second thing that also came that has complicated things on top of this namely the idea that they are constant quantitative relationships now, that's that's not at all the same thing, but that's what the the most other economists are looking for right there. So they think that in the social field in the economy there is that Loss of any kind in this should be of the quantitative thought such as the law of gravity and so on that we know from from physics, so there should be a Content constant quantitative relationship between different variables that we have trusted in and again, like one example might be the money's stock quantity of money on the one hand and the price I love you on the other all the austrians don't believe that there is such a constant quantitative. Because the money supply is just one among other factors that influences the price level and it does influence the price level only through the subjective values of all people all Market participants. So Market participants that they are videos that doubt with the faculty to choose and they might change their opinions and I changed the values might change from one moment to the other and of course, they're different one from one individual to another so that makes it there can be no such thing as a constant quantitative relationship. The only thing that is constant is indeed that there is a relationship between the money supply and the price level they're positively related but there is no exact quantitative relationship. I'm afraid that was quite a little bit but you ask me I know it's absolutely right.	-1.0

Bye. Bulls you can you can at least find find somewhere where they'll get along and don't just have to put them all together. All right. Yeah. Well and I try not to mix too much with young and old that's the other thing you guys probably the same thing is if he generally when they're young and Too Young or whatever young and old this doesn't work. I try and mix bulls that are kind of in the same kind of age bracket. Not not too much because II If you get too many youngsters In Their Own Zone, you know how many Smart Ones they're all just thousands of goofy. But then at the same time I try and just do it that way. I'm not saying, you know, and I don't know there's there's mixes that you're thinking it's all right. This is a perfect mix or getting along great and then one day the fight breaks out your welcoming six and you know, we all know that that program but So that's how I how I have my set and then the sixes or so, but and then the second part of your question, I already forgot. What were the how many trips you you put on the moles a year? So, you know, we have 20 rodeos and and that includes some bull rides and stuff. So not as we all know not every bull goes to every event but generally when they go they got they get back twice, so probably around, you know, 15 to We find out it's probably early and and but remember our our season doesn't start till the end of March and it's over, you know, probably around middle of October. So we kind of so strip for pretty consecutive. It's not like we you know, you know, it's spread throughout the 12 months. We only Rodeo for about seven months out of the year. And I mean excluding you like the NFR and that kind of thing, you know, but you only take such a hit small. There, you know a handful of them on speaking in terms of the whole herd not just hand out of them, you know, so yeah with with that being said have you I mean being that you know, and I think if I'm not mistaken and maybe it's changed now, but some of the rodeos out there California and stuff they may only have rights or buying buying bulls. Have you figured that some Bulls just can't take that whereas, you know, Omaha and and Boot Hill and bad news they can take That right? Yeah, so I actually most of the bulls that you're right some of the that is one thing I've learned about the bull deal that I I did not know before is I didn't realize how important in this sounds really silly and kind of naive but I didn't realize how important the the deliveries were on on the Bulls until the last few years before I you know, I always kind of treat them like horses are pretty good about you know, they kind of take a scoot out of there and they go pretty straight for a while before they start into their Circle. Usually well with the bulls as we all know if a bull Curtis back right gate, he he's so wired and program to do that right there if the gates in his way or if everything it's hard for him that change it up if they've if they've done it done it very long a good example is is so I have a good buddy in the Northwest and you guys know him and my Quarry he has a bull call Cowabunga and so Years ago we were going Cowabunga is always out of the left and we decided he Mike's bringing the reading and reading rodeos. All right. Well, we might thought well heck we'll try and figure out how to get Cowabunga out of the the right. So we were going to we're going to running through this dry if running through and making turn out of there out of the right. We hiding tailed just dry. Nobody even there now we can it was all we could do to make that simple sucker turnout. Out of there to the right. He just wouldn't get one do it just like is the only thing that has to be spraying or something. I don't know that goofy little pot liquor. We couldn't hardly get him to turn out of that properly and finally, II think what we finally ended up doing is running around running around in and doing it until he finally kind of went out there but it kind of ran down the gate even dry. Anyway, we tried to Buck him and it didn't work and gave her a ride and all that. So going back to my original point the it's if if they've if they've been out of one delivery very long. It it's so programmed in their mind. So for me, it's been hard to switch him. But I just try and change it up when they're young, you know before when I see like when I buy up a little if you know we get to a place is only has rights and and hopefully the Bulls young enough. I see I just start changing them up right away and and make them, you know learn to do it that way now. Obviously, I have some that don't don't don't ever change like jive turkey you were talking about him and Was too a while ago, you know, he's right there to the left. He's never been out of any other delivery and he's really good. So why would I mess with it?	1.0

So basically I jumped in like conditions were pretty much perfect. So two days before on the Thursday the weather it was really hot was like 37 38 degrees here and you know, you sort of thought. It was going to be like that. They would have cooled the race off. And then thankfully it cooled down on Friday. I went from 38 down to about 15 degrees like was crazy and it was raining and windy and so didn't really want that either too cold to win. But then so the of the morning of the race it was cool, but clear and there what was a bit Breezy at the start line and But you really I'd rather be a little bit on the cold side at the start line and and which is you know, so it was perfect at no point did I think I'm too hot and so yeah really lucky in that regard. And so yeah, it took off with the crew. And so this is a lot of people who are listening who are local live in the south Australia area and know the race, so this will Echo a lot. So we've had a bit of rain here. So things were very green. So the whole course looks beautiful this show is awesome. And so lots of you run through lots and lots of farmland and through quite a few conservation parks and everything was just Lush and green and so we and it is just and I really did spend a lot of time really paying attention to the course around me even though I've seen it a lot and I know I'm very familiar with the course. I always try to make a point of being aware of the beauty and of what I'm doing rather than just focusing in on myself too much and being because I find when I focus in too much on my my what's going on in my head I end up falling into a hole and negativity hole. So yeah first I wanted to start out slowly and first 500 meters. I started out nice and slow and then we one of the things we do. In this race, you have to climb a lot of fences like Farm barbed wire fences and stuff. And so on the highest and Trail they have these Styles setup, which is like just a little steps that go over the fence and throughout the hundred case. There's probably dozens. There's so many of them you get so sick of them by the end and it just gets so hard to climb over the fences and it slows your right down and the very end so	1.0
Protect its eyes from the other bees because it's realize are actually set much farther back and and the colors of other scales range from dark brown to dark green to dark green to a bold white color. There has closely resembles those of mosasaurs such as Tylosaurus and their jaws and the Jaws possesses two rows of serrated razor-sharp teeth and the skull colors have four digits and total of each of each hand with the thumb being the smallest digit and the rest of the dudes being larger. and of the same size and the adults have a prominent bony Spike have a prominent bony Spike that protrudes out of each of their elbows and the thorny tooth like structures other inner mouth somewhat resembled that of those of a leatherback turtle and additionally they they have long triple forked tongues that they could use to grab their prey with smaller skull crawlers are easily are easily distinguishable for the larger ones because their heads are smaller and more sloped and they also possess a more probability brown skin tone larger skull crawlers are almost as big as Kong and their heads are more defined and somewhat angled and their tails are also armed by some form of club that could be used as a weapon and also have boats bikes protruding from their elbows like I said before, The skull crawlers were designed to act as the Fallen Angels of cogs Kagan and represent the darker Bleaker aspects of Skull Island. The voice of the skull crawler is very high in tone. It's possessing a raspy quality of the hiss and growl mixed in between according to supervisor sound a sound designer and editor Al Nelson. The skull crawlers voice was inspired by the painful bye-bye the painful squeal of a Dying rabbit. And also the and sounds of sea lions and squirrels are mixed together. And this is what is the sound that they commonly make? And one of its vocalizations work we cycled from the indominus Rex from Jurassic World. And unless it's called crawlers appear to be naturally Fearless as two of them teamed up to attack Kong despite being smaller and outmuscled. The largest of the skull crawlers which by some has been given the nickname scold devil appear to be more intelligent than the rest of his kind and this was seen it when he appeared only ones called was subdued by Preston Packard and we'll what it felt like and what it felt like Earl Cole was tricking it. It also has to has to also seems to have a hint of sad ISM or sadism as as it licked columns face maliciously after he'd been Tangled Up and of shipwrecks Rudder chain, this large skull crawler was also shown to have deep desire. Killing and eating humans and that was shown several times when he diverted his attention from Kong to Jan's comrade at Mason Weaver implying that he opted that that he acts not only from Primal Instinct, but from over some degree of malice and cruelty.	0.0

I'm like still crying over the story. So if you do this, that's just me, you know being a worse but it's just um, it's a varied it's an extremely touching story and it is painful when you lose a staff member. So I'm thinking of so you have this yellow day and and you have this celebration of her life in May but leaving up to that time. What? Some of the things that you incorporate into your day into your way of interacting with your human beings, right one of the things that I'll share mine first and then maybe you could share something that you do is this is a really challenging thing to do. It's surprisingly challenging but as you go about your day and you run into 7-Eleven for your you know Snicker bar, not that that happened to me. I'm just saying, you know, I go in there for nothing but healthy things but you run into 7-Eleven. You and you grab something and you're checking out right? Look that person in the eye. It's really hard. It's a hard habit to get into and when they say, how are you how's your day? You know oftentimes your think I got to swipe my card. There's people behind me and I got to kind of find the right change, but we get in the habit of not looking at people when we talk to them or when we're in front of them. And and when that happens, I mean, I just think it becomes we become more disconnected. Even though we're surrounded by people. And so I think that one thing that can help is to become connected. So it's a habit. I'm trying to get better at and I have you know it Ebbs and flows like sometimes I'm better at it than others, but I noticed that I remember back going back to 9/11. So y'all, you know, I've been on this planet a long time some of you are like, oh, yeah, I was too and that happened. I remember when that happened and it was a very strange. couple of weeks strange and that you know one we didn't see our planes in the sky for a couple of days, but then when you would pass random strangers, I'm going to cry thinking about this but um, I'm getting it together here when you were passed random strangers on the street. They would look you in the eye and smile and and greet you which is very it's very different. If you're in a small town happens all the time. If you're in a large city doesn't happen ever like never nobody talks to you. I mean, you just kind of go about your day or base having their little mental conversations and they're going about their day. But for those two weeks we were connected and we were a kind. derp	1.0

Yes. Absolutely. I agree with you. It's kind of like a Hot Topic right now that a lot of people might hear and not know specifically what it is. So to break it down intuitive eating is a nonlinear approach to health and food and your overall well-being where the fundamental belief is that you are the expert of your own body. And so The traditional Health realm where we're constantly told to look outside of ourselves at the latest, you know Health Trends and gurus and food rules. What's good for you? What's bad for you intuitive eating asks that you actually just tune into the unique messages your body sends you and determine what is best for your health based on what you feel in your own body. So it's going to be different for every single person and again because you are the expert of your own body. Nobody can decide better than you what you really need. It's also a system that really helps restore a more empowered enjoyable and peaceful relationship with food and your body as opposed to having you work against and fight your body all the time and guys.	1.0

Give him the space to work in your life. My prayer is that. we can all be honest with ourself surrender these frustrations surrender our control give it all to God and that he will encourage us to step in obedience even in the smallest things.

And so I kind of treat myself with gentleness and acknowledge how much mental real estate this is occupying. It really beats being fully in the disease or in relapse, but you know, I do treat myself. not carefully or gingerly or with kid gloves or anything just with like, you know, just a little more tenderness than I have historically and so yeah, like I might not see a lot of people really often like I shared earlier about how I manage my day and how I only really take on two large chunks of activity a day because any more than that and I just get really anxious and	-1.0

But like maybe it does it just depends like and I think again, this is a conversation. I think we could probably do a whole episode on I think Film School versus not filming. We should I think we should too like I found it helpful for me for the most part, but what I didn't learn I learned a lot about story if anything the four years was worth the screenwriting class that I took an incredible teacher named Paul Larsen. And who the guy just the best thing about him? He taught me the one rule of screenwriting like screenwriting doesn't really have rules. There's one rule and of keep it interesting. Yeah, whatever it takes to make that happen. Well, we've that we've made not to jump ahead but we've made three short films together and I think that shows right? Yeah, I think so. I think that's it everything. I feel like I should have like tattooed on my butt or on your butt or is that you know what I mean, like like or on like a written on a wall would probably make a lot more sense or just an arm or just two dozen armed. Yeah or tattooed on my eyeball. It just like I think it's probably the best piece of writing advice I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of writing advice everybody has writing advice but if keep it interesting if you remember that and you look what you're doing, like is this interesting and even if it's just interesting to you, you know, that's that's a start as long as it's interesting in some way shape or form that was kind of the past.	1.0

So if anyone wants to go through the ESPN trade machine and fire up some fake trade that they came up with. I love it. I want to digest it. I just Love trade discussion.

But with yeah, my son is definitely because he's a mama's boy. And so it's a he's a great kid, but it really is challenging because you want as a man as I look at it. It's like, you know when you discipline your kids like the Appling you're going to receive outside of these walls of our house has no love attached to it. It's just cold. It's just you know what? I mean? So the discipline you receive with us. It's coming from a loving place. There's a lesson to be taught here as a lesson for you to learn and I think like as a man you like, you know, you want your son to be tough. You want to this she wanted to be that but I think you have to meet each child where they're at. They're all three different personalities, you know, and and that's another part of the challenge. Because you just want to sort of lay down this one law that doesn't work for you, you know, and that's you know, when you when you juggle in three different personalities or have them in multiple kids that definitely can be challenging.	-1.0
Yeah, exactly. I know other don't worry part of you is like, I've got a marathon to go that sucks. But then I was like no don't let that throw. It's a marathon yet only a marathon and but yeah and at that point, you know, you're starting to cross paths with more people. It was and then so I grabbed another at drop bag with some more food in it. And the next there's about 18 kilometres to checkpoint for and it checkpoint for I had my buddy run. I was coming on to join me for the last sort of 27 on ches. That was Aaron Cole batch and Aaron, it was great. So I sort of push through checkpoint to checkpoint for and you go through this section. It's my favorite part of the whole race even though about kilometer. He or the high 60s you're going up through what's it called Mount magnificent and into the fitness Conservation Park and it's just the so pretty through there like its Farmland at this is beautiful farm houses nestled in amongst these like really spectacular Rolling Green Hills. It is and the kind of Rocky, but they're also really green. It's just lovely and I really focused on Deserving that but also I focused on again anytime I could run I would run out hit the hills if it was a hill I would be if I was walking I was power hiking like I was really just wanted to keep my time to get my legs moving. And so I was at managing to power like it under 10 minutes per kilometer, which I was happy with so not nice work. Yeah pretty quick. There were people quicker than me at that. But you know, and at this point, I'd Fallen back a few places, but I sort of was focusing more on. And what I was doing and not worrying too much about the race itself and just worried about my own race. And then so again to check point for which was glorious and I for the first time I thought I'm gonna have a little sit-down at checkpoint for for a few minutes and that's that was my little reward for being very efficient through the previous age stations. It's at this point you at 77 km/h know you've really sort of broken its back and I Saw My Buddy Aaron and it was just you know reinvigorated me and it was funny though. My brain was getting a bit muddled as it is kind of now and I went to take something out of my back. My back was the first time I'd taken my pack off as well. I took my pack off briefly or took something out and I just somehow everything fell out of my pack and like I just had my shit everywhere and it's like I don't know how to put this back in and it's like I've been people laughing at me and And she's a really good atmosphere there and everyone just friendly and I got it all back in probably spent longer there at the age station that I really wanted to but you know it is what it is and it just some you know, it was not that was not part of the plan. But then with Aaron she just can't be honest and kept me running when I could run and made sure I kept sipping fluids and eating a beer and like it was a turn into a beautiful afternoon. Coming into the last sort of you come into kaipo forest from the last sort of twenty five k's and it's a pine Plantation. And so all right. Yeah. So pine trees everywhere. We've got a nice sort of feel and one going between farmland and pine plantations and like really I didn't have any like spectacularly low moments. I just I feel like I mean I was at low power low ish points, but I just was able to manage those low points better than I have in the past. So I'm really happy about that. And so my goal was always initially my main goal. I wanted to get under 12 hours, but I knew that was off the off the Record like 12 hours is pretty lofty goal one day one day one day but my next goal was to beat the Sun and so I thought I can still do that. So I had to do about under 13 hours to do that and I came into there's only nine kilometers between checkpoint four and five and I remember coming and so it's really nice short break. I grabbed a sat down had a ginger beer at checkpoint 5 didn't try to see there too long stuffed in some noodles. What took them on the go and I ate some of them and then had to ditch the rest because it was just getting a bit too hard to eat and I remember I had a what happened next? Yeah, then the last sort of 10 kilometers. Yeah, sad to feel a bit nauseous and then you know, but kept positive Aaron made me laugh and I was trying to high five as many volunteers and Spectators that I saw a long anyway, and then coming into the forest. I know the course really well the final and I actually from previous year. I had a landmark point where I knew. There was one kilometer to go but somehow this year I went past that last kilometer to go Mark and didn't notice and then I came around the other shit. The Finish Line was right in front of me was like just straight up by 200 meters and so some like always and I always was like somewhere I was able to leg it for the last couple of hundred meters and I managed to finish without using my head torch and not needing it probably if I was out for another 10 or 15 minutes. I would have had My head towards yeah, but I didn't need my head towards cross the line in 12 hours and 48 minutes and I'll start. Yeah, well, that's brilliant. Yeah, it's good.	1.0

I think the only reason you don't do that in games is if you segregate matchmaking too much then it takes too long to find cues. That's true. I don't know. I don't know if that's a problem for Counter Strike. It's like one of the biggest games right now. We just hit our sixth highest peak. And that's like really high as like 650,000 concurrent players. Oh shit. So after the operation like no like a couple weeks ago. Oh shit for almost no reason which is awesome. So it feels like people are coming back and maybe new people are coming in. And yeah, I mean, there's probably a bunch of people that are like the you know, the more they play and they just started you're going to get hooked. Yeah Counter-Strike.

Everything has been going. Well, no trouble anywhere. And then this trip but as soon as you to start going line treatment, yeah, no children cheer.	1.0
Yeah having the having the redeploy. Once again kind of just means you can kind of take your you could take your time. You don't have to worry too much and you can either go to the redeploy or you can go to that thing just to the South which was the overhanging bunker and then boom there's Cascades right there Cascades is the mid-tier and it also has the redeploy right there. So no matter where even if the circle is going all the way down to like Thunderdome like you can really take your time in that area. I think that's what's so enticing about is no matter where the circle is going. You have you have a couple of avenues that you can go you can go to the read a pulley right there, or you can go down to Cascades kind of get a feel like okay. Has anybody been here and regardless you still got that other redeploy. You got a lot to choose from and I think that's that's probably the main reason. It's number one.	1.0
Yeah, I did it. Oh, that's a spoiler. That's okay, dude. I forgot.	1.0

It's this is a big problem apparently in well, I was a big bump. It's been frozen for me, but it's burnt. It's been a big problem. It's there's an epidemic going on Catholics to convert.	-1.0
That's totally that's that's a good I think that's fair because I felt the same thing like there are certain things that stuck out to me, especially in the first episode like remember that blue guy. Why none of that blue guy in the first episode he was so out of place in my eyes. Like he he totally like totally didn't fit the show because like the Mandalorian at it's very core. It seems to me like it's like a space Western, you know, and it's like everyone's grittier and it is cheesy in some parts like the I have spoken guy, but it's still totally relevant. But the blue guy to me in the first episode stuck out like a sore thumb like he he broke the tone for me. That's when I was like, oh this might Bad show so I share the sentiment but I think okay overarching lie like the show is darker grittier, but it still has that like that Star Wars cheese in it though. It's like the character like the hard thing is now to make the Mandalorian an empathetic character because he's not taking off his helmet. I think that's going to be really interesting.	1.0
Listen to fall into a life of sin, you know, and that's the thing, you know our life as Believers. We've been called to a higher standard and then you know on top of that, you know, if you if you want to go the extra mile and you want to be a person you feel that you're called into Ministry. Then you go the the extra extra mile to be an example to other believers, but whether you are a Ministry or not, you're an example to Believers, you're an example in your love and your faith in your Purity. And so you have to be you have to be on your on your A game when it comes to what two people see it. If I had to wear a t-shirt that said this is you know, my life mission statement. I don't pick it. It's just what people have evaluated of Me by what they see on my Instagram by what they see me doing what I actually want to wear that t-shirt. You know what I be or would I be ashamed of what people think of me and what people say of me when I'm not around so, you know, we want to challenge you and there's probably a lot more that we could say on this but you know as a single young person in this is the question we get so much, you know, what do I do with my singlehood years? as you know, how do I what what is what is expected of me as a single person and I'm going to do some more podcasts on this because I believe it's something that if you're if you guys are if you guys are wanting to hear more on it, we want to we want to be talking more on it because you getting bombarded so much with impunity and and immorality and so we want to be that voice that tells you you know, what if you're being pure stay on the path God is so proud of you for setting yourself apart and for putting a you know, putting yourself in a position that yeah it may make Stand out to the world and maybe even make you stand out to your family. They make you stand out to other people, but God is proud of you. You're on the right path stay with it. If you need encouragement, we're here for you. Please find us on Instagram.

So it sounds like things are moving forward with Jillian. She may find this bridge round, but it sounds more likely that she instructor Capital could end up making an even bigger investment in the round Sterling is Raising this January and even more importantly Sterling is undaunted by any of the setbacks. He's encountered so far, which I think in the long run is going to serve him. Well, we can't wait to hear how it all turns out for him. We've got a brand new episode for you next week stay tuned after the credits to hear scenes from that episode. Our show is produced by me Josh. Cuchillo Molly Donahue and Kareem Maddox. We are edited by Devon tailor. Our theme music is by brake master cylinder with original music composed by The Muse maker and Bobby Lord. We were mixed by Enoch Kim with help from that bowl. Lisa mucho plans are recording events and thanks to hasta chaturvedi for her reporting on this episode. I'd like to thank Hannah Johnson, and daimyo. Yep.

That's totally intuitive. And and again, it's like you didn't even mentally understand why you were craving watermelon at the time but there's this inherent wisdom that your body has to know what it needs especially in a in a situation where there's something out of balance. So, you know, it's ironic because diet culture the system are like the system that exists that really promotes dieting as the way to health really demonizes cravings and tells us that our Cravings are something to it. Nor or that, you know, we need to fight or overcome our Cravings but in your case layout like you're craving was telling you the exact thing that you really needed and that was going to really benefit your body. So you listening to that and you giving your body what it needed was the best thing you could do for yourself at that time and probably had a really positive impact on your blood circulation at the time.	1.0
That was like gross.	-1.0
I mean, I'm a running coach and also a mouth as if I listened to the podcast nose and we get so fixated on top running for a certain time. I finished time and I and I had a client say Only once during the speed session and she'll quite often doesn't want to train with a watch on at all and not even know you're like your $10 digital watches you guys. She said she wishes it there was a watch it didn't measure your time, but measured your your enjoyment like so, you know, especially, you know, if only we had a way of measuring like other metrics for our run and so it'll be good. You know, you get to a point and your little watch says that you're enjoying yourself, you know, like do Native watch for that but because I didn't I get so I do I keep saying on on getting time goals the truck certain training sessions and and making sure I was getting heart rate goals and you know, all that stuff. And yes. Yeah, so I think you would probably you seem like the kind of person who would like to buy a watch. It measures your enjoyment and not your time.	1.0
That's true. I have a whole list that I keep it. It's just like it's like pushing a stone up a mountain. It's a stock so many new great host and great shows. Yeah. So we've also got our boy Jughead check it for site there where he's being kind of wooed recruited by a stone wall prep. Hmm. We're we got mister. Cheating's played by Sam Witwer. Yeah, if you're a big fan of Smallville, he was on there or if you big fan of the Clone Wars, he was the voice of Darth Maul on the show that show but now play mr. Kidding.	1.0
That's what your point was caused because he's like you already are from him and you fat shit.	-1.0
What was it like working with him?	0.0
Yeah good back then. I mean that was the only way that you were really going to pop and you know as a young kid, especially given your situation, you know, you wanted to just signed a deal you wanted to get that money. So you just did it unknowingly, you know, these kids don't know anything about business. So there's how it is like the labels were literally just taking advantage of all these kids that just wanted to put out some music and I wanted to be famous and get some money.	-1.0
What now is dedication Relentless effort to achieve your dreams putting the plan together? Not just jumping into the water with no life vest put the Strategic plan together. So we greater than you were yesterday for me greater than anything anybody could ever imagine. We just think about dreams. We believe that it's up to other people to believe. In the truth is the only person that needs to believe in you is you sometimes when terrible things happen to us we go into this dark shape and we stated and we believe that this Darkness will be on hold forever, but you gotta understand that every pain is a lesson.	1.0
By the way, we don't know if he accepted my offer.	-1.0
Yeah, I'll go first. So I think anyone who probably knows me since I was a kid knows that Audrey was that anxiety girl the worrier and I grew up in the church and so a big Big part of my upbringing was you know, pray about it and you know, don't worry don't be anxious and have faith and all of that stuff is fantastic and amazing and it is helpful. But sometimes if you have a sinus infection or you have the flu you go get medicine to help you with that or you go see a doctor and so my anxiety kind of got to a point where it was really hard to even function where it was just like okay something is not right here. And so I would say probably probably in college is kind of when I finally was like, all right, this is not this is not normal like normal people don't get this worried to the point of you know, you can't even do new things or you can't function in life. And so I started first seeing a counselor and she was really really helpful. I think one thing about a counselor is they're awesome. But sometimes we kind of view them as like a Next it's like okay, I'm gonna fix it. But just like a car you don't get your oil changed once and then drive the car for 10 more years sure. So I think with anxiety different things in your life can kind of happen and it rears its ugly head. And so I think it's important to kind of know yourself and know what your triggers are and and acknowledge them and then not wait until things get really really bad before you try to get. Because it's just going to be that much harder to dig kind of dig out of it. Yeah, for sure. Yep.	-1.0
Like there's a connection now, so I think that's so smart of them to do because people do forget what it's actually supposed to look like and because in the prior Seasons, we've kind of gone away from some of the ballroom and some of the other styles kind of came in and then it was a fusion style but Going Back to Basics I think makes a lot of sense for the show.	1.0
Yeah, well as much alluded to earlier on with giving the goals away too easily. We're not killing games off and that's why we against against Braga and the next game should have been out of sight really but I was actually here when that game was going on and then drove back listen to on the radio and I just said it just makes the come back for the form of even more amazing when they inevitably come back in two days. You didn't know that there was one that was going to give it away at some point we Play well for 90. It was very similar to The Villa guy absolutely battered of their staff from one of our best performances with Villa and then they get a man set off as well. So I'm thinking what is going to absolutely annihilate him second half but they seem to up their game with yeah - we just I don't know what happened. But that goal from a teeny. Oh, you think it was across that? Yeah, I think mentees you think I think he meant. Well you did it again today. Maybe it's going to become his thing is that he can score from these ridiculous tight angles, but he just sits right?	-1.0
Terms of mood I'm not trying to be an asshole so know you're getting genuine. All right, like Society lie so that I feels like the at some point it felt like you're watching like the first first episodes like nice and slow in your they kind of there's not a lot of talking which is I appreciate they do a lot of kind of establishing shots and they really let you kind of try to understand the Mandalorian without showing to just over facing on the personality front and just like shoving it down your throat, which I think was also Next vacuum Patients Out of the viewers, but then at the same time there was like so many kind of like corny Parts where it felt like you're kind of you're constantly flipping in and out of the moment of it being very serious to being light-hearted and I genuinely could not tell if it was like a show for people who are young or show for people who are older.	-1.0

I have 12 years experience working in a VA with children with ASD. I thought I knew a lot however after attempting the Beast few times with no avail, I have been humbled I found myself built-in pigeon-holed into one small area of a ba in Wind taking the test.

So I just want everybody to know that I accidentally scheduled this trainer.

So you just said that like Tupac was initially tabbed as Malik. So how did you slide in and get that?	1.0
Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about in terms of undesired consequences. The thing that we have to realize about a show is that you have the showrunner you have the writers, but then you also have the director and you have the editors specifically the editors. Those are going to be the ones are like, oh this shot and then he's going to look at him. They don't like him, you know, and they do kind of work in tandem, but each one. Those people have their own motive and I think what we caught in was this person's like who's Derek? I'm gonna you know, they're not going to do on the show. I'm going to slip this in for the fans ha ha ha and then you have the people like, oh well slip in a little steric and kind of string along the fans and then you have someone's like no staring and so it's just this mishmash of all these different motives and it makes it entirely confusing because you also have to remember that by season for we're dealing with Shelly. They either made a huge mistake or someone was really exposing but there was a storyboard release of their ideas. It was like an outline for season 3 be specifically for 320 and on that board. It said Styles mom, but it did and it was like in small letter. So something that you could tell that they weren't really expecting people to pick up but specifically there was no mention of Malia no mention of Shelley nothing. And so it's like you give Holland talks about used to talk about getting the scripts the same day and I'm like you have a period of time that is specifically for writing. Yeah, what is happening that you're giving scripts the same day of shooting what's going on in here? What's this mishmash?	-1.0
And but I don't know if that's your business not so yes Daniel articulated and part Danny took my thunder and part. Thank you. That's it. I don't know. I think Thunder stealer. I know I thank you for that barring your thumb to give you do due diligence there. The reality situation is at almost every company that you hear from on the pitch is going is needs to be moving toward machine learning and artificial intelligence. And I think that as we grow and we them More customers we have the more valuable the business gets and so as we grow that Network effect provides us with industry data based on verticals like a pit like apparel Electronics, etc. For each of Our Brands that industry is gay this seems different to me than the network effect.	1.0
Yeah, and I think it's also incredibly disenchanting and a huge part of my audience is you know, there are atheists that are genuine atheists and there are quote unquote atheists that are just really hurt Christians and I see both and I don't you know, I don't say they're always one or the other but that does exist and the reason is because also we're told that every good good thing happens because we're involved in church and because we're being perfect and we're saving ourselves and we're honoring our husband and we're listening to our leaders and tithing and when you're doing all that and you're in a sexless marriage or in my case, like you find out your husband was cheating on you and it rocks your world like then all of a sudden you're like wait all of these things that were supposed to protect me that I have been doing right, you know, like I used to Like the girl to find girls and that's why I harp on them so much for anyone listening. That doesn't know Nicole and I are both YouTubers. So there's this whole life Christian space of YouTube, which is very Niche but it's so funny thing always get recommended to me too.	-1.0

Paperwork really before the season started you had to get all of your employment forms and certifications done. Now that you have your team chosen, there are a few more paperwork tasks, which you should do. This is a time when you can be creative. So embrace the fun that comes with coaching. If you're not the creative type. However, you can choose to find some of these items online and save yourself the time regardless of your coaching philosophy. You'll need to be clear about at least one topic during the season team rules while discipline is disgusting. A little later on discipline should only happen after team rules are broken after reading the discipline section create a list of your team rules and print out enough to give to each player and also to distribute to families at your first meeting together this way everyone knows what is expected of them and it's not caught off guard when you take disciplinary action, if you have different levels or kinds of discipline depending on the rule, which is broken list that out as well. Not only will this help deter rule-breaking, but it will also help you. A consistent once you've created your team rules, you need to hand them out to your players while you could just give the paper to each girl and hope she at least keeps it somewhere in her gym bag. I prefer to hand out team rules in a folder which I customized for each player. This could be as simple as writing their name and number in the top right-hand corner. You could get a little more crafty if that's what you're into and add stickers quotes drawings Etc on their folder. It might also be fun to have a folder decorating station at the beginning of this year. Meetings to keep the players entertained while you talk to the families younger players will probably appreciate this more but the right group of high schoolers might enjoy it just as much so why hand out folders when all you're doing is handing out team rules folder is generally more sturdy than the paper which will likely end up crumpled at the bottom of their bag next to a rogue sock which are not even sure is there's but now you have a safe place for other papers to go if needed say you're traveling for a tournament and want to hand out the information at practice. You'll be safe in the folder. Maybe you want to create a habit of writing down team and personal goals before each match that can go on the folder to you're helping yourself in the long run by giving them a safe place to store anything you think is important enough to print out and give to them later on in this book will look at keeping stats for your team in that chapter. I will give you tons of reasons to implement stat tracking in the beginning of your season, but I want to give you a tool now which will help you use stats for each individual on your team. Not just at the broad. Level if you search hard enough online, you can download a personal stat tracker for your players. This encourages one-on-one discussions with your players. If you have the time, but can also be an easy way to communicate about their individual performance and growth without having to use practice time to have these meetings. If you'd prefer to create your own personal stattrak or consider including the following spaces to communicate growth over the season serving percentage passing percentage setting percentage attacking percentage block. Aces assist digs and notes to demonstrate growth. I like to show the team and average percentage not including the most recent match or tournament. Then I have a column with the same stats, but for only the most recent match or tournament, this will show the players how their most recent performance Stacks up against their previous performance during my second year of coaching. I also included the team percentages so they could see where they were in relation to everyone else on the team. I decided to take the stat off of the form itself. Elf and instead share these numbers verbally team stats are a good measure which you should definitely track but you're adding insult to injury when someone realizes they're dragging down the team passing percentage every tournament. They'll know when you announce team stats. There's no reason to include it on their personal stat tracker. If you're going to have meetings after every competition to discuss individual progress, you can give players one sheet, which they can use all years track their stats if you prefer to hand out stats and only have meetings when necessary I Handing out a new sheet after every match or tournament one word of caution on personal stat trackers. Your players can take these very literally and the self-confidence of younger players, especially may suffer communicate with your team that they are a learning tool and cannot capture everything which a player brings to the team enthusiasm and teamwork are just as important, but those are hard to measure add positive comments in the notes section to discuss ways in which a player contributed that is not made obvious by the stats. Building trust and culture remember in the very beginning when I said that some parts of this book will have a greater impact on your season than others. Well, this is one of those areas and it is major right behind your coaching philosophy is your ability to build a positive and productive team culture and while coaching philosophy and culture are of the utmost importance. Your influence will not extend as far as you hope without first building trust to start. Let's talk about trust we all know in our gut when Trust someone or not, but what behaviors actually generate trust think back to your former coaches. Were you ever told you're going to get a lot of playing time today only to sit the bench like always or have you ever gone back to serve only to see your coach panic and call for a substitution, even though they weren't sure who they were going to put in or have you ever asked your coach about playing a new position or trying a new play been told? Yes, and then never get the opportunity these experiences likely deteriorated your trust in. Your coach and impacted your commitment to the team and their goals while it occasionally happens breaking promises to your players or not being prepared for certain situations on a regular basis is one of the quickest ways to fail as a leader of your team. So how do you build and maintain trust for starters? No your coaching philosophy. If you haven't taken the time yet go back to chapter 1 and do this now. This will show you your true coaching personality when you understand that you can create policies around. Values which you are more likely to follow even during high intensity and high-stress situations. How do you do that? It's mostly self-monitoring want to brighten someones day by telling them that they're going to get more playing time. Just don't even if your intention is to get them in don't tell them this a few hours before the match when you're still uncertain of all the playing conditions do they need a heads up? Yes, but only when you know for sure that they're going in not one you think it would be nice if you could get them more playing time. Or if they want to try a new position and you think the time is right let them know before I match so they can warm up in that position. Don't think you'll get them in need them in their regular position. Just tell them that delivering bad or unwanted news is hard. But if your players know that you're being honest with them the trust will build some pointers don't over promise if the answer is no say no explain decisions. If the situation calls for an explanation fight the urge to explain decisions other Eyes say what you mean follow through with promises. If you fail to meet a promise sincerely apologize behind only your coaching philosophy and Trust building team culture is one of the foundations of the Season which you need to make a priority your culture is essentially a mixture of the most dominant personalities on your team and your values in coaching volleyball and girls, especially it's important to maintain a positive and supportive culture.	1.0

Thanks your thanks respond because I mean we really do mean it. I mean it was super easy for us to be like me happy but instead with you know, we wanted to end it on really good note. So that's that's why we went that way because you know, Of like you it is pretty much just it is pretty much just like supporting respawn and you know saying all right, you know this this one's this one's a given I guess, you know for now because I mean there's not like they can do anything about it.	1.0

So need gets it gets really dangerous when the smart teams are also the rich teams like the Yankees who have been so very disciplined over the past several years fans screaming go back to the days of old when you threw money at everybody and that's not the way they had operated for the past several years until this offseason and when the perfect storm for them got laid at their feet they needed in a starter Gerrit Cole is Guy that just doesn't seem like he has any alarming issues tied to him at least at the moment. I know that's knock on wood for any pitcher, but there's a reason why he got the money he did and pretty much everybody agrees that he's probably worth it. And so it became a layout for them to be able to get it done. But in the past they have been operated like the Yankees. We used to see in the before the mm rolled around and they were winning world. Oops year after year after year, it's been a little bit of a different dynamic in that front office. And they the Dodgers are sort of a similar team we talked about this when we initially started talking Lindor rumors at the beginning of the offseason and I said one of the things that I think will be interesting is how desperate to these teams get where you've been operating this way like the Dodgers have where you have the strong farm system. You already have a really deep talented roster. You probably don't need to do a lot but are the fans starting to get it to you. There are Upset is just winning the division every single year and hoping that you the two random randomness your way into winning a world title. Are they going to be happy with that or are they going to feel some pressure and that was always something in the back of my mind that that thought. I thought maybe that was something that could help push or escalate a trade of Lindor to a situation like LA because if they're just evaluating this based on spreadsheets and surplus-value. Value years of control cheap control at that guy's that allow them to spend more money on other parts of their roster through free agency. If they would like to the one thing was going to change that was that sense of desperation and needing to change the the way they've gone about things in the past several years and we'll see because They didn't come away with that that major free agent peace or trade piece as of yet. So are they going to feel that sense of desperation as this winter unfolds? I don't know but that was the one thing that was kind of a wild card in my line for getting these these sorts of this sort of trade done.	1.0

So I gotta say this news about James really took me aback. It felt like there had to be more to the story. So I've been calling emailing texting whatever I can do to get ahold of James and so far nothing. He hasn't even liked one of my tweets, but in all seriousness, I'm not as much bothered that he isn't responding to me. What bothers me is that he's blowing off Sterling it's fine if he changed his mind about investing these things happen, but it feels like At least pick up the phone and tell Sterling that the good news is James wasn't the only one who invested in sandbox Commerce.

Okay deaf, and Alice is surely now. Yeah, sounds like Shirley, but to be honest I get inspired a lot from Contemporary videos or like hip-hop so something that's not Ballroom sometimes of course, like if I'm doing a ballroom practice or something, I'll look at like that. So my favorite girls and I'll just like watch them and see the way they move their bodies and get inspired but a lot of my inspiration comes from hip hop dancers and especially people like his funny but like, you know, Casey rice. Yeah, I know keys right here comes Shawn and Casey are she has no idea who I am, but it's okay, but I'm a put it out there in love with the way. She's connected to her body and especially people like I don't really know her like Jade Jade Chenoweth. Yeah, I'm not really familiar with her. But her work is just I love the way. she's like she's committed into what she does wrong and Fierce and Powerful years people like that really inspire me people like Beyonce when she releases those videos and she has like her hair flying like that also inspires me like her Persona inspires me and I want to be like that like that kind of girl in that Ballroom field because a lot of times like you don't really see ballroom dancers out there, you know and feel like I want to inspire people the way these icons Inspire us, you know, like people like I like that Fela or Beyonce.	1.0

So I do time. The first time was amazing. It was three months to the day after the shark attack and I just had two stitches and Staples out of my leg. And all I wanted to do was get back in the water and two of my mates came over and they took me down to Bondi with a couple of surfboards and I was really paranoid about it because As a really populated beach in so I felt embarrassed and self-conscious and I've got my eight foot board under my arm and the paparazzi were there taking photos and so it was pretty hard to deal with but I'm hoping down through the soft sand and I get to the water and I can maneuver my way to about waist deep and I put my board down and the only thing I was worried about was I just whispered to myself. Please don't let me paddle around in a circle. I didn't I nearly drowned smashed by every single way. But eventually I got out the back and I was in the song sitting on my board with my mates and it felt so freaking good and you know, I try to remind myself that a lot when the running blade actually hurts a lot when I run I don't enjoy running that much anymore. But I remember how good I felt after I made that huge effort to get down to the beach to Get out into the waves, you know, it's not always about the struggle of doing something. It's about the happiness at the end and knowing and they're just living and that that it motivates me to get up off my ass a lot of the time when the alarms going off at 5:00 and I'm like, I don't want to go to the gym. It's cold out and but I know that feeling will come as soon as I'm out there doing it and living and so I always give myself a bit of a mental uppercut and Y'all started live. I've never ever regretted that but I've definitely regretted not doing things.	1.0

Is that what you're telling us a couple of the challenges that you have is the fragmentation of the market and you look at owners that say take a multi-family developer. For example, these may be small family offices that are throwing up maybe a couple of products every few years and they're not what we would Define as cereal buyers a construction services. And so when they go to develop a apartment Complex, they say right? What's the lowest cost that I can get this at the make the pro forma work not what would be the lowest cost at scale? If I was to build a thousand of these things some of your more your larger owners more Progressive owners think of a hotel flag like a Marriot. They are fully bought into the concept of modularization because I know they're going to be building hotels from now until the foreseeable future and the more cost-effective way. They can do that. They're interested in that and a big way. So at bathroom pain that's built in Miami or bathroom fathers built in Seattle. They're all for standardization Montreux zation and making their buildings more efficient from a construction standpoint because the scale and the dollars that have Place think of the same thing for somebody like a Facebook or Google that's going to be investing in billions of dollars worth of data centers over the next decade. Those are the folks that are really lean in same. All right, if we're able to save one percent on Ten billion dollars worth of construction that's real dollars that that that's a conversation. We're worth having if it's a fifteen million dollar apartment complex that only means, you know 1% of that to one owner. It doesn't get a whole lot of attention and when you see the magnitude of dollars that are spent on a sort of capex and the industrial face those are big dollars and the opportunity time the down time relative to construction or maintenance in those plants has big dollar. As well, so it's really the magnitude of the opportunity that gets people's attention. Otherwise, it's just something neat to talk about, you know, can we build something offsider prefab and slide and employees great.

Let me watch as a child. I never scart. I was scarred somebody enriched as well. And so when Terminator 2 like the big SQL is coming out as like I couldn't wait to see it. So I actually went with my parents and sod and the movie blew me away, you know, not just in terms of visuals, but in terms of the storytelling like the story structured in such a different way that I'd never seen before like you want to talk about, you know blowing Minds wide open like that's what happened to me to the point where R. That was when I first like picked up like one of the one of the movies I think there's a movie magazine called Premier that I used to read. And that's when I started picking up that kind of stuff and looking into what actually went on behind the scenes to bring that to everybody and that's when I realized like I think I think I have some stories. I want to tell I like I want to like make something I want to put it on the screen you were enriched and obviously all this beautiful picture you were engulfed in the magazine.	1.0

Need to go to a diner on one of those guys and there's a reason for it. It's because I went to Africa to shoot a documentary and I was working with a really brilliant guy called dynein Manda and he found he's an Australian Navy clearance diver. Also who founded the International anti-poaching Foundation and he started the first all-female run from the anti-poaching Rangers to the managers to the staff to the H all female run from Broken backgrounds abandoned by their tribes and Villages domestic abuse women and he's down in them together to fight poaching in Africa and I was there filming with him and he didn't eat me and that just blew my mind. I'm like why the hell would you like one big and I'm like what the hell is happening? I don't think me and I said why you know, I grew up. I love meat. I eat ate all the kangaroos in the world and he said we'll look I was out here trying to protect the animals and then I go home and I'd eat the animals and I felt like a hypocrite and that kind of run of bell with me and I thought well shit, I'm doing that with the oceans and I'm eating animals and I hate hypocrites, you know in the military were trained to lead by example to do as I do not as I say and so I always drive to be that sort of person so I can't justifiably go out into the world and say hey you need to protect sharks and look after our oceans and look after our environment if I'm going home and I'm contributing to the destruction and so very very slowly and I'm talking very slowly. I started canceling out different things and expanding my repertoire of vegetables and Grains and all that sort of stuff and I've been plant-based for nearly four years now and I love it. I'll never go back why I thought feel healthy strong. I didn't lose any muscles, you know, I didn't grow boobs for meeting so food, and I haven't had a single injury training in four years.

So in declaring company the parent company kind of controls the dislike the monetary side of you think any company or like any of the subs, right? So I feel like it's definitely an EA thing like even with a discount like the if you have like EA access origins or whatever you can get 10% discount, but even then that's like still a lot of money. Yeah. Spend on a gun skin that you probably won't be using for the full game. I think that they'd still I think that they need to kind of drop the price a little bit if they want to make more but did you hear that? They made apparently 92 million dollars. Yeah before the battle path. I was like who's buying stuff in the store?	-1.0

So basically the all the kids that we have that we hand out that general public get there's ampules point 4 mils per milliliter of Apple of the naloxone in the kits and there's three samples per kit with three syringes and there's also nasal atomizer naloxone that people get handed out as well majority of the law enforcement's usually have those There are four milligrams. They work pretty well. However, the majority of the ones that are handed out are all the inter muscular injectable injectable kits. So those ones that we talked about are just wanted to really expose everybody on what's in the kit how to properly use it then we talked a lot about how to actually recognize and respond to an opiate overdose. And we talked about some of the myths of of the overdose responses as well. So this is just for us. Nervous system depressants from opiates specifically and not certain certain stimulants.	-1.0
Like you could be taking heavy prescription narcotics due to a chronic or an acute event in your life traumatic pain or something and accidentally take too many or mix another pill that makes you more subsequent to overdose.

It's lazy writing. Honestly, like very lazy writing. That's this whole show has lazy writing and I'll definitely have a couple more notes about At but I just was like dog and and while they were in the car, all of the lines were total plot narration, like explaining and feeding the audience stuff that we didn't already know which I guess is like Fair because it's only the second episode by you just referring to the fact that like Oliver had a crush on her.	-1.0

So I met him I made a beeline to the Ace Hotel and and you know, there there are traditional VC and keeping in mind, you know, we're raising we were raising a little bit less than you know, what a seed stage investor would Best so we were raising 250 and so the discussion we're actively having with structure is you know, do we come in in this round potentially or do we come in and your price round and in the first quarter of 2018 and so that's and it's so that's a that's a and they've been incredibly responsive we've gone through due diligence as well.

I do not know even though I think there is hope somewhere on the way that goes on even if it is County. I listened to this song when things did not go well and I could I get a positive feeling she put her feeling in her songs and the feeling moved the listeners heart. I felt that it was nice to express her own self in her lyrics See was really respected by a lot of people so young woman who admire her imitated her fashion style hairstyle makeup such a long hair in his Cuts in eyebrows and seek bottom.

So I like to use a bar of soap in the bathroom that I can. So use on my face and then of course your guests want the soap to come from a pump. So in the kids bathroom / guest bathroom, you know, it's a hand soap pump and sometimes there's also a bar there if you know one of the kids wash their face in the sink, but for the most part they do that in the shower. So I tend to wash my face in the sink on some mornings. So I like to have that there and my husband doesn't seem to mind using a bar of soap in his sink either and I feel like it's a little bit cheaper. So when I mentioned soap dishes that's more in the master bathroom, or maybe it's for someone in your hall bathroom to wash their face with but I do recommend having a pump for guests to wash their hands with when they use the restroom.	1.0

We'd have him for half a season and then I'd want to see someone but he could do both as medical plan the wing and he weren't too bad for you like the middle. If you do any when didn't either we just won we just won better cover the cut and cover that will challenge the first thing because all right ice like Cody off right sometimes but he's got nobody really who can challenge him for that position then Duncan maybe could Bennett has played there when Cody hasn't but I mean, he's not gonna pressure code. So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right. But yeah, even Eve said that the cleared yet. He said it got to the point where no Challenge and you just couldn't get motivated. He said he was playing Robert. She didn't care.

Okay, their Top 10 Prospects available right now rdk Medcalf the straight line receiver from Ole Miss Drew lock quarterback from Missouri. Brian Burns The Edge from Florida State's. Both Iowa tight ends Fant and Hawkinson back-to-back. Devon Bush middle linebacker from Michigan Josh Jacobs running back from Alabama Christian Wilkins from Clemson Cody Ford Guard from Oklahoma and then Jonah Williams and then greedy Williams right behind them. So there's your top prospects on the board right now according the simulation in round. One and I like the idea of Jonah Williams. I do Wonder like you said it might be a luxury you kind of want a guy who's going to come in right away and play a little bit more do use your top one at 12. But I'd be I'd be leaning toward Devon Bush personally myself get that another Dynamic linebacker to play with Blake Martinez go sideline to sideline and can and he's shown he can be a truly Dynamic player.	1.0
So I enjoyed it. Yeah, a lot of people complain about wiping the the high chair down.	-1.0

Like that's really what we haven't done anything at all last in the last six days. I have done 10K like just be the case. We'll fix that ready for black or will hopefully on Thursday said yeah, how you feeling about that? Well if the moment I had a chat with we had family discussion about yesterday or the day before and so we just went through cutoff times and my wife said to me five k's an hour you can warp that prong outlet and so that put the at this armor wasn't feeling very motivated. And sometimes I think the more wife doesn't like my running and then every so often she says something like that like just pull your finger out and do the work so Yes, I was actually very good with motivational and although I didn't have a very good not last thought I did run you stay and I'll probably run tonight with how I feel right now. So I look it will be 23 hours instead of what I would have originally liked but I think I'll get it right now. That's my thought. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with 23 hours is still covering that distance and it's an amazing amazing face. Yes, you should Fun. What do you mean to be? I'm happy. It won't be this horse. Yeah. Well, I'm hoping it doesn't pull with rain because a couple of years ago it rained all day and that was just that was not fun. I don't know. I wish I liked riding in the rain.	1.0

I would you know again, I would love to give pennant Kevin the benefit of the doubt because certainly I would think that he would realize he was abandoned by everybody around the farm. Plus he found out where everything that the farm was up to amass enough to make you reconsider your actions. Like why was I supporting this guy that was going to carve out my body parts to sell to somebody else and then I just abandon everything and just took off in the middle of the night deliberately leaving me behind. Yeah, especially because he Frank says you were Left behind because they didn't think you could be trusted and yet there was no that Kevin did at the end of last season that even gave you the slightest impression.	1.0
Thought I was a different person and me being all dolled up with my makeup my heels my hair like it was curled. My hair was like curled like I was like really doing the thing. So Bethany thought I was some girl that she didn't like Bethenny was drunk as fuck. I like forgive her it's fine. Like she's been arrested like 10 times I Castleton like she no longer. I think she got like expelled from Casselton. It's fine. But so be bad, did he so interested? Um, well, yeah Bethany thought that I was a different girl like and me and Bethany like got along just fine, but she thought I was somebody else and so she poured a whole bottle of wine on my head a party and everybody just look here's Bethany like she'll Bethany. Yes. And so every this bitch pulls all pours a whole bottle of champagne on my head at a party in front of probably Hundred people and I was like, oh, this is an embarrassing or anything. I like go home and cry. But so I look over and she was like, oh my God, like she was probably unlike so many drugs and alcohol the bathroom. Okay. Goodbye. So what was I saying? So, yeah, so she turns around that. She's like like so turn out of her mind that she did say sorry. She was like, oh my God, like she didn't know it was she did not know that that was you whatever whatever she thought that you were somebody else and I was like, I think I was just speechless. I like got home and just showered because I was I had a whole bottle of champagne all over me Meanwhile. My boyfriend was living in a double-wide trailer with Three other men and I basically lived there too. And so I like go back to his place and like shower. Oh my God. It was just it was bad. And I think that was like the same night I could be wrong. But I think that was the same night that girl like got expelled. I have no hard feelings against that either like we're all young and do dumb shit. There's no hard feelings, but I just think that this story till this day is funny as fuck and I'm the one that got a whole bottle of champagne pour it on me and I still think it's funny. So love Bethenny Bethenny Bethenny and Mary. I just know I don't want to say names but Honestly hilarious though. Yeah, their name should be married. Bethany know their names will not be exposed. That's their real names though. Mary and Bethany probably this. So anyway, so yeah, I'm a little bit shorter, but my next one will be good Andrea back to you. All right. I'm going to throw it back to high school. The one that I told you before that I wanted to say. I feel like I'm not going to say it now because it's funny but there's I have a better one. Okay. Yeah, I'm not saying I have like so many stories that I can't even think of one satoko because there's a lot my second see this have some this wasn't the drunkest I've ever been but it was probably the most like ignorant drunk I've ever been in. I was in high school. So it was my junior year of high school. So apparently I just have this thing with Junior years. I just enjoy just junior year is a good time. Yeah. I was like, I'm 16.

So this happens in a lot of movies not just Star Wars but where if they put on like big bulky suits The shirt and they they have objects like they're handing coins across the counter that are like larger than normal. They don't look like they have the correct weight. Like I know they might be on another planet may be different gravity. But do you know what I'm talking about? Like when he's climbing on the giant tractor and they're throwing shit at him the Wookiees are ya they and it doesn't feel like they're those blocks and stuff are the right weight. So feels like looks not Dido cheap corny. I don't know how to put it put it but doesn't look realistic.	-1.0

Yeah, it does goes from Cape Jervis across the bottom of the floor area up sort of near Victor Harbor, which is nearer we start at y pinga and and then it goes up through the Adelaide Hills generally. Then across right past Mount lofty and right up into like sort of not far from the Clare Valley and and then you end up it finishes in the Flint North and the Flinders ranges like up in the desert. And so obviously we just covered the bit down on the this south of Adelaide and so basically going from wiping out to kaipo Forest for those who are not from here that doesn't really make any sense, but locals know all about About it. And first thing I will say if you're not from here, this is like becoming a really good 100K race. Like I've seen it grow over the time that I've been doing it and Ben Hawkins is the race director and who sort of the founder of ultrarunners essay and he's also a very good friend of mine. He has just he put his heart and soul into these races and he he goes he was so he was a crook as a dog on the day he could barely speak. Because he had and his wife is 38 weeks pregnant and he was there at you know, and he just from from Son Well Before Sunrise and too well to the very last Runner came in, you know, like he just you know, they'd lose race directors work hard and then also that the rest of the team like been pieman, pardon me and and Michelle Hanlon and probably a bunch of names. I'm going to forget plus all the a station volunteers. They all everyone just works really hard. At this race and this year was the best year. So anyway, I took off really fast. I'm running along I get to the first style to step over the thing so and hang on. Hang on.	1.0
This is not fair to the Dodgers if they pull off a smooth flow. So as I said, if nothing else, it's raise the bar to a level.

But for the most part it should be about cleaning surfaces and I do have a minimalist approach, although right now, I feel like I don't have enough stuff in my living room because when I first decorated my living room when we moved in, Had put a small plant stand below a picture just to kind of balance out a certain wall and I put a plant there, but now I ended up moving that because people kept bumping bumping it and it was just kind of flimsy and then now they have something else set sitting on top of it. I think it's the modem or something like that and they have it moved over by the TV.	1.0
I think right now it's just we're so focused on this and we want to really make this our goal and we want to do the best that we can possibly do with this show. And for now, we're not competing because we do your here we want to put all our time love effort everything into this and if we're going to scatter ourselves, it's not going to be good for anything.	1.0

That's fine. Just keep in mind a few pointers on one designing practices. Remember to keep explaining to a minimum unless it is a drill or concept which needs clarification and will be used multiple times throughout the season make sure skills practiced relate to any games played or are emphasized during scrimmages. Only start with foundational skills and build your way up. You can see where your players are at a might catch a few mistakes that would go unnoticed if you just jump into more advanced drills. Okay that was chapter for the beginning of your season from coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season. I hope you all enjoyed this longer episode from get the pancake. If you're interested in getting yourself a copy of the full book, which is 10 chapters long and it takes you from your decision to coach all the way up to starting ear to it is available on Amazon both as an e-book and now in paperback. Just because it's on Amazon doesn't mean you can only read it on your Kindle. You can also get the Kindle app for your iPad. But if you are like me and many of the other coaches here the paperback version is great my intention for writing. This book was a to give you a heads-up about what's coming. If it's your first season and be to serve as a reference point for you throughout your season, I recommend you read through the whole book before you begin coaching, but then keep checking back throughout the season because things will come up that you're not expecting or you may forget about it in the beginning of the season and then in the middle of the Season you realize that you need to talk about burnout or something with your players. This book is great. For those of you who are coaching middle school high school or Club volleyball for the first time youth volleyball coaches. You will probably get a lot of value out of the book and if you're hoping to advance into Club coaching Maybe more Elite youth programs. This would be great for you just to give you a heads up as well. There aren't any drills in the book. But if you've ever been to get the pancake.com, you know that you can find a ton of volleyball drills online for free and you don't need to pay for them. Especially if you're just starting out.

No, I agree. I'm really excited draft is always been kind of my thing as well. I've watched it every year really going back to when I Javon Walker was drafted. I've watched almost every round every year since then so it's been a long time of watching the draft on and on this guy's case and and in recent years I've gone with you guys a little bit with the threshold and what focusing on the relative Athletic score and doing a little more mocking and just reading up lil bit more and kind of paying more attention to people who aren't named Mel. But we look at this year specifically there is a lot going on for what the Packers could do their work in free agency over the past week bringing in a miss the Smith and Billy Turner have really made things a little less clear as to what they're going to do in the draft. They don't have to go get an edge right away. They don't have to go get alignment right away tight end to you probably should but if there's there's still options out there for what Brian go to comes can do and this is the perfect draft class for him to make moves and move around and get the guy. He wants no matter what position it might be a couple.	1.0
Yeah. So this was the first mileage club and it was at Duncan McKinnon in Glen Huntley that morandini ass track. And yeah, I thought you look fantastic like you certainly piece together.

You know saying that's my that's my baby, you know. She honestly I was supposed to go to with a wedding. I was supposed to go to a wedding with her today and she knew that this weekend was important for me to spend time with my family and my friends with my boys and honestly for her to give me this moment, it's a type of love that is liberating not controlling, you know, and I've had my fair share of controlling relationships in the past and for me to be at this point, she had this been with you guys. It's really cuz I her so, thanks, baby. I love you. Thank you. Mom my dad for being together for 37 years. It was just their anniversary couple days ago. So ever so, you know, one of the reasons why I am the way I am is because my parents have been able to have that consistency in their marriage and be great role models for their kids. And then thank you to California Family Fitness and all the clients and all the family that in relationships that I've gotten over there. And thank you too. Just everything and everybody aim.	1.0
That's that's that's good, you know, and that's I just know that if he's out of a page bull and a good cow. When he's done, somebody probably gonna want him, you know, so Not only was he bred well, but if he has a good career that you know that you could look and Bowl, you know, so that that's kind of what I look at.	1.0
Now that's that's yeah. I think I think I mentioned before you know in the last two years, especially I've seen the change in agents attitudes towards it but at the same time there's been a lot more businesses and people entering the industry and especially in Capital Cities. I think it's it's a very low barrier to actually enter the industry given you have these higher options or you know, I'm simplifying at a lot. So I'm being overly simplistic, but it is as simple as You can convince somebody to use you to style their home. You can do it tomorrow, you know, you can you can go to a higher company if you're in a capital city and you don't have to own anything. You don't have to actually outlay any costs other than your time obviously to build a business beyond that takes a lot more commitment and energy and cats and all those things. But you know in terms of setting up day one to test it's very easy to actually put your toe in the water if you were to go and like and I should also clarify that and say, you know, it took us a couple of Months before or phone calls and meetings before got our first job. So it's not as simple as that, but you know in I guess as you say young industry with low barrier to at least enter in the early years, it makes sense that we're seeing a lot of businesses pop up.	1.0
That's not a valid measure either guys. That's another example of invalid measurement totally and	-1.0
I totally remember that the period of time where I was like, oh he's so great and people just need to leave them alone and back off.

What is next for you?	0.0
So I just feel like being very body positive and I try to like also like bring that out and others It's because I don't I don't think I've talked about this on the podcast yet. But I've had this like weight loss Journey where I was 300 pounds. I still like felt pretty good in my skin at that time. But I've lost like I don't know like a hundred and twenty pounds no big deal. It's like but like learning to like love yourself at both sides and seeing your imperfections because I still feel at this size like not good enough. And like not hot enough and what has really helped me accept myself is actually nudes. If I'm being 100% honest. I've gone from a size 0 to size 6 back down back up and I can find flaws at any size. But I think at some point you just have to look for the things you love as opposed to like picking out the things that you hate right and I still definitely picked myself up are same but it's so helpful to be like, oh my God look at me. I look at like what this body has accomplished always want to look at you. I always want to look at you and I do girlfriend. Look at them bubs. Oh my God, so I guess that's that's the T if you want to take a sip.	1.0

If Sterling is a superhero, it's safe to say this pitch is his first time donning a cape under the lights in front of the investors. He looks nervous.	1.0
Yeah, I'm not surprised anything that I room does at this point, but we end the episode because Kind of figure out what's gonna be the hook for this season and we've got see see some tantalizing things Cheryl. Mr. Honey. What's going to happen with Reggie news Ted that certainly tantalizing hook, you know, Alice and the farm and Charles and Betty, but it ends up being at least the flash for we get at the end of the episode is to spring break and we see everybody's searching for Jughead after he says I'm going to Stonewall it's gonna be great.	1.0

Well a lot of People kind of say like, oh you just threw the baby out with the bathwater like you jumped from Christian to atheism and that wasn't the case at all. I actually still believed in God for probably two years after I stop calling myself a Christian and I just had this feeling of like organized religion put God in a box and like it forced us to have these certain stories that were culturally specific and that didn't, you know, go over like to other countries. Or whatever and I just remember having this like since the freedom where it's like I could go to any country and experience like what they consider like profound spirituality and I could apply that to my life without feeling like, you know, it's not accurate and and I just remember thinking like all these religions throughout the entire world have claimed to have spiritual experiences. They've To have these miracles happen and I just I didn't like thinking like they were wrong and I'm right and like my specific story is like the one true truth and like shedding to that story itself allowed me to view like God in a much more like open way that I found super inclusive and inviting and more cohesive. And you know, I still actually hold a lot of those values. Like I want I think I'm still slightly bitter when it comes to organized religion, but I definitely want to get to the point where I can go, you know to other countries and experience, you know, their religion and their culture and everything that comes with that and just, you know, apply that to my life and you know become a better person based off of these were	-1.0

Hi everyone, welcome back to the high percentage podcast. I had a terrifying 20 minutes there because I was having microphone problems and I was like, wow if we don't got a microphone, we don't got a podcast today, but got that worked out. Hey back after a Hiatus last week. We did not upload an episode and an old teacher of mine used to say there's a difference between excuses and reasons and I have reasons for this. Which was I did a DCC play-by-play last weekend. It was great and it was brutal at the same time. It was two days of nothing but watching matches and typing, you know, quick play-by-play summaries on to the computer and then quickly kind of uploading them and getting them refreshed on grappling insider.com on the plus side. We had the most traffic we've ever had in a single weekend. I mean, we really crush it and I think we did the only play-by-play really that I could find on the internet. Yet and I don't know why because it's something that definitely people look for and find Value in so that was fantastic. The downside is as far as I could tell we watched over a hundred Jiu-Jitsu matches and you know, I love Jiu-Jitsu as much as the next guy or girl but that was brutal man way. It was nine hours on Sunday and we didn't finish until the Super fight ended like it probably seven o'clock and I just didn't have it in me. I couldn't talk about Submission grappling anymore. So I took a break but I did post an article about a DCC over the week and that's why I like to talk about today because a TCC is a fantastic time to kind of check in on the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission grappling because it's generally agree that it's one of the top.	1.0

So late as a good visual the show like like let's say a quarter mil in a vial of powder of heroin could be a weird lethal dose and then it showed a vial of Fentanyl and it was only a couple of specs like candy or something - well, there's like one or two little specks in it. So it just goes to show you the volume of how much stronger is because people always here at stake. It's a hundred times stronger than morphine is hundred strong kind of the Fentanyl and then car fennel is another a hundred times stronger, right?	-1.0
So you have you have shot in your mind like a bad movie before absolutely.	-1.0

That's the problem and how would you tackle the economy?	-1.0
Yeah. Nothing lasts indefinitely. Yeah. It's certainly not something for the next three of five years and I don't think it's something that we could and should expect within the next 10 years or something. But I could be wrong. I mean one thing that creates me because the whole doll system creates problems of its own and the problems themselves might get out of that. It's not sufficient that the current crop of politicians and central banks and so on that they are knowledgeable and that they are relatively discipline. So they don't exaggerate the practice of helping themselves with the printing press because there are other problems that are resulting from the current monetary system that we have. The most important ones being that is the lack of responsibility of the dear responsible ization and of the of the financial markets on the one hand and the the consumption of capital on the other hand. Okay. Let me be the first one is probably this needed that I explain this to you and to your audience because you're probably aware of this right that simply if you know that you have some something like a backstop that comes Through the printing press Yahoo! Central Bank behind you or the Central Bank the sues the mission of stabilizing the financial Market well, and it does so with the printing press then this amounts to a socialization of a part of your risk. So as a consequence risk taking as rule is always on. All right, so you get very from oil you valuation of shares and other asset classes and so on and you get equally enthusiastic use of Leverage. I had to do to get the results that you need at least in the short time. I saw the economy is moving on a on a did path. Right and this makes the whole thing very fragile and it's like some sort of apology. So we are with this connection. I believe this is quite obvious. The other problem that I mentioned is capital consumption all that that's less less obvious. Probably and what I have here in mind is that thanks to the printing press you no longer. You destroy a part of the incentives that push people to say, of course, you reduce the intent of to become self-reliant. It's only good food. I've been so on especially you reduce the incentive to save as a consequence. You are diminishing the capital base right now in real terms of the economy. Now the question is how strong is this effect? If you look at the official figures you might think well, it cannot be that strong because we still have increased of capital. Vested in real terms. I looked at the figures as found its true. So this is this is the impression that you get but then of course you also know that governments try to manipulate the figures themselves. And especially in this case the price inflation rate review. You are probably aware of the work of John Williams Shadows dance dados dad's right? So I've been following this for 15 years ago fascinating when I saw this, Because what he's doing is just providing estimates right is no because you don't have the raw data. He's just out of his own experiences just estimating the deviation between the calculated inflation rates with the current methodology and the inflation price inflation rate. That would be calculated with the prevailing methods in the 1980s. So he comes up with differentials of about 7% I think right right now right seven seven nine percent. Sometimes this is Its enormous it's just mind-boggling. So I read through macro economic statistics information about Capital Investments. And so on in the light of his figures and my conclusion was that if you if Williams in is right, then we have been consuming Capital concept is since the mid-1980s something like this and even if he is not entirely right, but it's only half right there probably will be consuming capital for the past 20 years in	-1.0

Yeah, that's right. And I also love music. So on the most of my training runs on could you every single training that I'm listening to something music or a podcast and during events? I tried not to like put it off until I do start feeling like I need something else to get me out of my life my brain and music really helps me and I'll sing along and I'll do my shredding a guitar and that really helps me. Yeah to me now. Hard parts of a run but I also think you just have to I think it's worse if you try and push the negativity away like just kind of embrace and then it will pass.

Like he's just I don't know what he's made out of but that guy is so energetic and he's just so talented and being his partner on tour was actually the coolest experience ever and his fans were so supportive. And what I really liked about him was the fact that he took the time out of his day. He came out of his trailer signed everybody's autograph talk to people so he wasn't kind of like, all right.

I was like, I was like, okay like I could join the military, they'll pay for my college and also like it was kind of like not sure if I was ready for college to be completely honest, like I felt like I needed to kind of go out and like see the world and like screw around a little bit. And you know not it's not a very not very popular. I did like not go to college right after high school, but it is if you join the military, I think it's just weird and I definitely would recommend it for anybody and I definitely would recommend a right now, but but it was it was very good for me. You know, I did I joined the Air Force at 17 and I ended up spending about five years in the military honestly because I knew at the other end of that I'd be able to afford to go to film school. Yeah. Well, thank you for your service. No. Thank you for your service. All right, so did it pay? A off do you after you so you yeah, so in the military then now you're going back to films.	1.0

Okay, so the joke. No, but that was a bad joke. So Dave and Ricky were with me when I was doing this when we were driving we're going to the mall and you know, it's Gotta it's gonna be the bird gonna be the bird. Oh, no. Most people after they heard that part probably knew exactly what was happening. Now know this bird wasn't on the road or anything like it wasn't just like walking on the road and I'm just going to fast and I hit it now. I was going 5 miles over the speed limit 45 is a 40 miles per hour road. You know, how most birds are flying they go over your like windshield or over your car, you know, that's because that's normally miss the car. They don't want to die. Well this bird what's coming perfectly is going to is going to go over pretty did something and they like dip 90 degrees and what under my car now at first I didn't know if it like went under and missed the car or hit my pipe because I didn't feel I didn't feel a bump.

That's the best news ever and then they're like, well this season we just won't have one for you this season, but you know, it's we hope you can still like be okay with him being like are you kidding me this doing Dancing with the Stars? Absolutely like the fact that we're just here together and Bosh. It's too like we're both living this together. It's we're in this together. So whether I have one or he has one, it doesn't matter.

Glad to have you here. We did meet recently at the symposium. Dan in Sydney for the first time so that was kind of the first time that we met face-to-face and now we get to talk a little bit.

We're going so paper cutter. The last movie was there's plenty of technical about it, but it was kind of ass, like first really getting our hooks into we'd worked on a couple other short films, but this is our first kind of try it like a real movie like something that looks good. So, I mean that feels good something that fills professional and we did I think a pretty good job we learned a lot and that's definitely stuff we can talk about probably throughout This podcast as long as we do it we learned a lot we made mistakes. We did some things right and so we made a lot of mistakes and did some things right. We did a lot of things right and we made some mistakes but we learned from all those mistakes and what we're going to apply to the next movie jump see which we want to be really I wanted to be Top Notch. I wanted to look a hundred percent professional. I wanted to feel I wanted people to be surprised that a couple dudes in Utah made this movie, right?	-1.0
Yeah, so we that's a really great question and you depending on who you ask and Industry you get different answers around that, you know for your commercial guys. They're looking at you know, what can be what could be marginalised in a commercial building. Right? And so that really speaks to things like bathroom pods or you know, anything with a bed really is replicable. So if you think about multifamily product launching even health care hospitals mean one of my clients ones don't The hospital is really just a hotel with Med guess and so it's it's maybe a little bit more complex modularization, but that is really where we think of modularization on the on the commercial side of things on the on the industrial side of things because the downtime is so expensive and an industrial environment. There is a much more incentive to explore off-site construction and push the boundaries of what could really be accomplished through modulars. Ation, and so the modules that you are seeing in the industrial environment are massive large to the extent where some of them can't even be trucked in other being shipped down rivers or up rivers or across oceans, you know from one side of the world to the other massive ships. You're seeing this very very large Mega units modulized units and it's because of the complexity of the work in the preciousness of So time in that industry in oil and gas to wear weeks mean millions of dollars for an operation and if I'll that can be constructed in another facility either in another state on the other side of the globe and be shipped in just in time to be put in place with minimal disruption to operations. That's really the advantage.	1.0

But yeah, you made a good saves and we played quite well throughout the game, but it just took a lot of patience to build to break them down. And then because that horrific injury that took 10 minutes out of the game gave us the extra time to go to get the goal that we needed but ironically	-1.0

And if there's something that scares you then dive in deeper like yeah, it's scared me when I read, you know, women need to be silent at church. That was one of my really defining moments where I shut the Bible and looked up at God and just was like yo, Yeah, what like I was like so beside myself about that. I was like just like I've been honoring you all of these years and I'm made to like sit here and read that like, what does that mean? And it did not shake my faith. It didn't turn me away from God instead. It caused me to be more intellectual about my faith to be more curious about the history of it and I'm far from knowing everything but like People should be inspired to be intellectual not scared of it.	1.0

So the two the three names actually that caught my attention. We're Darius Slayton Connor McGovern and then there was another receiver in their mouths Boykin. Excuse me. So both Boykin and Slayton are guys that have Packers I can guarantee you're going to be in love with they blow the thresholds out of the water. I'm looking at the position though, and it's starting to get a little log jammed with a selection of Depot Samuel. Connor McGovern is a guy that I would be looking at in this area and this part of the draft solid solid player, you know, he's a little bit developmental but that's what you're getting in the fourth round. I think that's exactly what they're looking for in their lineman right now. Not only that he fits what they're looking fits their thresholds with the four five seven short shuttle and a 7-6 6-3 cone. Obviously, he fits the size. So I think Connor McGovern is the selection for me here Joel Marino talked about his ability to play in a Zone. Out and also has some lateral Mobility. So I think he fits with the Packers going to try and do in the Run game very well and then you can try and teach him to coach him up. I should say in the passing game. And so I think that Connor McGovern is the selection for me here.	1.0

So the last thing we'll do is we're going to go into some reader mail. Okay, first up we have Travis. Hey guys and girl with the release of Apex Legends with with the release of Apex. Legends came the inspiration to replay Titanfall 2 campaign upon completion of the campaign. I noticed something pretty interesting in the final mission. There is a huge reference towards Apex Legends. I was dumbfounded the Bounty Hunter that catches you in Titanfall 2 campaign mentions Apex Legends and gives you a and Apex card as a sort of invite to the game pretty cool. This could also eat or this could also even have some relevance on future characters in Apex. Maybe. Could you possibly be Pilot Jack Cooper in Apex or even the Bounty Hunter mercenary General martyr. What are ya'lls thoughts? I mean, we talked a little bit about Titanfall. So I felt like that was a perfect email to bring up. I mean, I honestly did not know that I full disclosure. I'm sorry. I'd actually didn't get all the way through the Titanfall campaign or whatever so I didn't see this but Travis I didn't finish it. It's oh, yeah, I know. II I've always wanted to and it was just one of those things like I think when I happened to pick it up I have to pick it up on a little bit of a sale or something. I didn't pick it up on day one, but I absolutely love the multiplayer and when I play a game and I really really like the multiplayer. It's kind of hard to bring myself to to play the campaign the campaign like really really good example is like a battlefield one. I really like Battlefield ones multiplayer, but the second I went into Campaign and I started to die. I try throwing down a med pack and I'm like, oh, that's right. I can't do that. Yeah, so there was just so many moments like that. I just couldn't get over it.	-1.0

You just don't get the abilities because I just imagine everybody choosing Bangalore everybody choosing wraith or everybody choosing octane for that matter. Yeah, because having that, you know regenerating health or whatever would be really nice. And so I feel like that'd be the only well I guess without the abilities you wouldn't have the great generated. Never mind.	1.0

So in order to find security in God, you need to stop finding Security in everything else right and worrying about everything else will how is this going to happen? How did it end like stop wrestling against God and let him show you who he is right in chapter 15 Abraham and Abraham believed the Lord and the Lord counted him righteous because Of his faith not by his Good Deeds, but by his belief in who God is and and that he would be faith that God would be faithful in his promise right not worrying about the details of when just acting in obedience and being faithful to God when we ask God for something and have to wait we can be tempted to take matters into our own hands and then it interferes with God's plans. Right? Like I know for sure and I call this like a detour Because I opened a studio when I knew I rushed into it. God was not calling me to that at all II like instantly had anxiety. I was stressed like in those things do not come from the Lord right? But this was early in my faith when I did man when I was just striving for achievements and I thought I had to earn God's love. I thought I had to like like accomplish things in order to earn his Van earned his blessings, right? I took matters into my own hands all the time all the time. I wasn't allowing myself to be still it because I really didn't truly know who God was because I wasn't in in deep relationship with him because I was trying to be in control of everything.	1.0

I'm going to assume that you have one two or three bathrooms. So you can either do each step in each bathroom simultaneously and just kind of run back and forth or you can pick one bathroom to deep clean and then just lightly straighten up the remaining bathrooms, but I'm going to talk you through cleaning a bathroom and there are there are less variables with about The room with the kitchen. I'm like, I don't know if you have a dishwasher. I don't know how many dishes you have to do and things like that, but how we clean our bathrooms is pretty straightforward. So first thing I would do is walk in and see if there's any clutter on the floor laundry towels trash.	-1.0

But I mean, that's there it is a funniest fucking Three I've ever heard when I think of like sex stories. None of that's ever happened to me. No, like that is some like what the fuck happened that night like you're gushing at the knee. I had some what the fuck happened and I wake up and I'm like, oh that was kind of psychotic but like yeah, nothing to the point where I also don't I don't have you ever used Tinder or like any of those apps know I like started dating Cody when that became cool. I've never like an iguana literally never had one. I think when I Freshman College. I made a tender and then like some man he messaged me and of course I'll got it was just so weird and I literally don't think I ever answered. I started dating someone and like never responded and just deleted it. So now I just don't have a tender. Can I also just say I like I'm not against like Tinder and people who online date but personally if I was ever single, I just don't think that's how I would want to meet someone. Yeah hit the bars hit the bars or the dog park. Yeah, you know Not that I've seen any Daddy's at the dog park, but but that's a natural way to need someone. Yeah, and I also think no Enjoy. Maybe the bar isn't always the best option. Yeah do something like a hobby that you enjoy. Yeah. Maybe it's someone's work out. I put see any time about the oh God meeting people know Jenna's where no, I think if you have a dog and you're single go to the dog park go to all the darts on Daddy's there. Yeah for sure. And usually a little off but whatevs. No, I definitely and I can I can say this like I have a boyfriend but there's definitely some handsome young men at the dog park. Oh, yeah sure and I'm sure a lot of them are single looking for a lady and they have don't hit it up who doesn't love a man with the dog half. The reason all my got happier. Okay. I'll say like point three percent of the reason. I love my boyfriend so much is because he's Golden Retriever and I are essentially a relationship. Yeah Cody has little I don't use my man. Dog, but but but it's a different. It's a place like if he had no animals like I don't know only love you a little bit less but not too too much. Oh, yeah, we had this we had this other girl who she wanted to her who this person is. Yeah. We don't know her name. She did like message. Oh, yeah, so she's just trying to she wants to shout out her her ex boyfriend who cheated on her. We don't know who she is, but gee. She's but we appreciate your content. Yeah, we do like a bear up in Lovin her ex-boyfriend had to dress up as a Playboy bunny and go to Hooters and we're all these different things like and she basically said so my cheating in all caps ex-boyfriend lost a super embarrassing bad for Halloween and someone was kind enough to bless me with all these pics. She sent some pretty amazing photos. I mean obviously seeing a man in a tight pink ones. He's always Amazing and then she just said gotta put that baby carrot on blast. So there it is. She's on blast. She won't let us follow her but I truly hope that we pay for her. Yeah, and we wish her the best she jumped the reason I like the reason we were saying this right now is because she just messaged me and it just said cheating loser of the week. Okay what I'm not really sure about these like dicks drawings. Yeah, I don't think that hitting us. Yeah, I mean like they're they're like they're funny. I don't know how old she is. Maybe we can chat later with her. Yeah, if she yeah, she said she wanted to stay private. I don't know. So maybe she's just not even a real person but it's fine fans supporters supporters. Always we love that not appreciate you. Can we do? All right guys? Well, this is getting a little lengthy. It's so lengthy. I hope you guys listen to this whole thing. Yes, I think this is our best one yet. I just get I just burped love that little baby burp. Thank you guys that you guys love you not or nine to fivers. Yes. Thank you for listening, and I will see you next week. Bye. So we wanted to mention a podcast of the week recently Andrea and I have been listening to the young and ambitious podcast by Sienna Marabella and Emily Duong. I don't know if I pronounced that right? Sorry if I didn't but they basically do kind of just like modern-day girlboss adulting type of podcast very motivational. They're just two young girls who share their Journey with you as well as keeping you motivated and informed on how to be be a modern-day girlboss. So we love them. Shout out to Young and ambitious podcast.	1.0

Yeah forgive us.	-1.0
Associated with that outside of these really like that, you know, not a lot out of body or anything like that, but this is monologue going on in your home. Yeah. It was just I have absolutely no fear of death anymore because I know that death isn't scary, you know, being a parent and being attacked by a shark yet terrifying really but death itself and going on to whatever is next. It's actually quite peaceful and the First thing that I think now is well, the only reason that was was because I had no regrets and I had nothing no thoughts of I should have done this or I should made up with this person. So now it's like, okay. So all I've got to do for next time I die is make sure I feel that exact same way. So now I get to really really live because there is no fear of death. There's no having to hold on to the Mortal coil. I get to be anyone I want to do anything. I want I'm happy and all I have to do is just have no regrets and they loving to everyone and help where I can and now I just really changed the whole direction of my life and my mindset so you're saying is the key to happiness is to just almost died and then live it.	1.0

They're all very there's a lot of variations of different programs out there different splits, you know, but the most important thing again is just consistency because I don't focus on the Minor Details. I mean if you are only able to go to the gym three times a week, I would probably do a leg Push Pull or three full body workouts or depending on whatever your goals are. You just have to prioritize that workout program towards whatever your goal is. Gotcha.	1.0

Hi coaches, this is Whitney with get the pancake a podcast for volleyball coaches today. I have a special treat for you. A lot of you have been requesting longer podcast episodes. And so today I thought I would surprise you with a longer episode and combine it with a special reading of a chapter from my book, which is coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season. Now, this book just recently came out in a paperback edition, and I'm super excited that so many of you have already gone on to Amazon to get your copy. I wrote this book in 2016. It has been available as an e-book. I know a lot of you were really waiting and holding out for that paperback copy. I'm the same way. I like to have my book in front of me instead of on a screen but for whatever reason it was a challenge to get that out when I wanted it, but it is finally ready. So after I read this chapter to you if you are interested in getting the full version it is available again on amazon.com the chapter that I'm going to be reading today is chapter. For the beginning of the season now, you may be thinking the beginning of the Season that sounds like it should be chapter one. But as you read this book, you'll realize that there's a lot more to coaching than just stepping onto the core and running practice and playing games again. This is going to be a pretty long podcast. I'm really excited to share this chapter with you. I hope it gives you some good direction and gets you excited for your next season of volleyball whether that's your And sixth or even first season, I hope you get pretty pumped. So let's go ahead and jump into the chapter. Chapter 4 beginning of the season from coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season written by Whitney Bartok. You may be thinking finally we get to practice the answer is yes, and no, of course you get to practice once the season starts but there are still a few administrative tasks which need to be completed.	1.0

I mean if you can think of anything draft related, I've probably been working on it. I've got my own personal big board that I've been kind of putting together that I'm hoping to release probably the top 100. I am going to be nowhere near the level that the guys should like the draft. Gar, as far as how in-depth into the prospects I get I'm not able to watch 300 guys. I just don't have the time for that. However, I'm hoping to release the top 100 which would be a first for me. Hopefully working towards maybe a top 200 next year. So but that's kind of hot right now and also the Packers thresholds as one of my I think my proudest little accomplishments that I put together. It's just, you know, I can think Justice mosquito for putting together the hard data and then Then I just kind of put it all together each year and last year. It was relatively predictive. So I decided to do it again this year, even though you know, it's only good to come second year. He pretty much kept to the thresholds that were established under Ron wolf and that and then under Ted Thompson so we can get a little bit more into that, but I'm pretty excited for our show today.	1.0

Storage is an issue. So attending the Symposium recently instead need hearing the storage company get up on stage and talk about how they can offer all these things to stages. Like we just don't have any of that down here and I'm sure in a lot of regional areas don't have that access. So storage is quite expensive down here removalists are expensive. So I've been lucky to find a couple of guys who do Up me, they're not a furniture removal us as such with the truck, but they are very good to me and they do look after my friend nature when we are moving it. But also the biggest challenge that I've found is is actually educating people about what home staging actually is in the area when I first started right at home staging II overheard my dad telling someone what right at home staging was all about and he got it completely wrong, so I had to tell my parents It's like basically gave them a script on what home staging does so and to this day I still find it's an education piece with everybody on home staging and how it can benefit them when they're selling their home, which is a very yeah, I agree and it's it could be quite difficult because you not only selling yourself.	-1.0
That's A cool but like ones that's why would you pay for National Geographic? It's a weird thing to pay for. I feel like I guess I don't know my dad would stand around and watch National Geographic on TV all day or whatever but like and like once I everyone seen every fucking Pixar movie and then you're going to watch the new one theater is and then like well, maybe that's you I think people have kids and stuff to you know, I think most people you have Disney plus.	1.0

I feel like her runways are getting a lot weaker as the competition progresses and I feel like someone in the chat brought this up, maybe the runways her and moan.

I feel like Monet is has stronger.	-1.0
Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
He he did he we did the music video and he's like listen, I think it would be so cool. If you can come out on tour with me and I'm like, I don't really do that. And also I'm competing but most importantly I have a husband who I don't know if I want to leave her that long right? It's like, of course this is going to be the biggest opportunity of my life and to say no no to that would be so stupid.	1.0
Yeah before but I like I guess the streamers I were following I was falling but didn't hint at it. But I don't think they were the ones who are playing Apex either the ones you were watching respect the non-disclosure agreement. Exactly.	0.0
Right and I need to and I'm going to suffer the consequences of my of my bad choice, but instead it is it's so much easier to vent our frustrations in our anger and try to place it on somebody else. So at the end of the night, I went upstairs and I looked at my husband and I was like I don't even think I said anything we both started laughing and I was like, you know, I'm Kat I've been asking the Lord to soften my heart about this to forgive me. I was like, it's so hard. You know what I told him. I was like, I really don't want to be nice to you right now. And that's when we started laughing because I knew that it was even though I could not replace this or an imminent, right?	-1.0
Yeah, well yeah they put they put in weird ones at certain times because I think it's weird place not it's not that it's like I don't know I think it's just the way it sounds like it's just weird vocalizing like I think that iCarly has in between music too and I could be wrong not to bring up a Nickelodeon show on a Disney related podcast again, but I think that they also have him to music the Miranda Cosgrove and singing It's just instrumental but I think that's why I don't like this one and it's weird because again, she's just like whoa whoa, whoa	-1.0
I'm like, why is what is this Deluge that I have unwittingly subscribe to but now I feel sort of like my my perspective has really changed on it because I've reaped so many benefits and sharing how I feel because I've	1.0
Right? No problem is too complicated for God if you're willing to let him help. But that's it's so hard to admit our wrongs especially when were angry or were sitting waiting for a promise from God and we're just were anxious or feeling overwhelmed. I mean, I know I get so antsy in the waiting period but that's when we start to take take things into our own hands.	-1.0
No, dude, honestly fuck scans, but what I'm saying is like what if Lana's can I pitch something to you for like an interview? Pretend like you're a Gabe Newell get into character get really into it. Okay what he sounds like. This enables God.	-1.0

She was kind of it was just I just didn't although I did the thing about this plot that I did like was when they cut to Jackson and Lily on the couch back at the house. That was kind of yeah, I like that and she really was like, why'd you put on wrestling and he was like, this is the award show. That was funny.	1.0
I think that's got it ever got to be one of the biggest steps towards keyring a therapy.	1.0
I agree with you that I think it should be like, I think they should revisit it for a limited time think Jessica. Test and see I think it'd be so cool to have like let's say the last three squads or something and then like a Titan drops and of course, you know, like the squads are going to run for the Titan. Yeah, because I think a lot of people who are against it and saying that a Titan might be too overpowered also doesn't realize that in Titanfall them if you're a pilot and you're not in the tighten your number one like your number one goal is the mantle that tighten and pull that battery out. The Titan is like dead within a couple seconds, right? Yes, like it would it would be testing it would change the gameplay. I love it. I would like it but I could see how people who might not be much of a Titanfall fan prior to Apex would be overwhelmed with a total of those people exist who played Apex without knowing about and it's playing Titanfall. I mean the player base is so much. Oh, that's a good point. I think they're really the last time they announced a milestone was like 50 mil. Yeah, right they like that. So I Like that definitely it wasn't what Titanfall 2 clocked but but who knows? Yeah, I mean, I feel like it would just it would just be nice just to have it and the game up a little bit so that it doesn't get into that kind of repetitious Lumpur has something people can look forward to that like old fans would be really excited for I think for sure.	1.0
No that ain't it Chief. It's called depression.	-1.0
But now the recovery how long did it take before you got back to feeling like doing these things? I assume that was a long process.	1.0
And I think that's the part that we don't get I'm still like because I'm still confused about 320 and I've talked to people behind the scenes have Nation about this and I mean Dylan already came out he went to Alpha Kane. He just like dragged Jeff for riding in the sex scene and he talked about how there was supposed to be like a moment with Stiles is Mom. But specifically for like that episode there was talk about how Dylan was confused as to why it was going in the direction that it was going so suddenly and made absolutely no sense and because Like there was well there was talk about the how there was supposed to be steric and how it there was going to be a build-up to steric. It was actually going to happen and that there was like plans and there was agreement and contracts between certain actors to like build it up whatever and that it just all shifted randomly for no reason, which I still don't know about it still don't know the information. There's still missing pieces that just nobody need to talk to anymore because nobody's connected to the show.	-1.0

I love what you said because so to answer your question from earlier like a lot of people think okay. If I if I ditch the diet mentality, which I'll name as the first principle of intuitive eating. eating is stepping away actually from those diets from the strict rules about what's quote-unquote good or bad for you and instead giving yourself permission to include all different types of foods in your life in a way that promotes balance and you know, just Variety in general so To answer the question. Can I eat whatever I want? It's like yeah, you can you can eat whatever you want. But if you truly are in tune with yourself and listening to your body, as you said Casey, I would I would imagine and I've experienced and I know a lot of people I work with have experience that you do want to eat more foods that make you feel good because when you are connected to how you feel after certain foods, you're less likely to just eat, you know foods that drain that energy or that make you feel Early tired sure, you're going to eat them sometimes but I think people have this idea that like if I didn't have this super intense discipline around what I ate, I would just like, you know stock up on french fries and Twizzlers all day and I think we need to give ourselves more credit than that.	1.0

What do you do and it's actually what he's been doing. He's looked at the world. And for example, he he said right there are children dying in Africa because they can't get clean water. I'm going to solve this problem and he writes to the universities in America gets the greatest Minds together funds a few projects which are completely crazy and last week we had on the podcast a guy called Alan Steel who recommended a book called Loom shots, which is about crazy ideas that can change the world and this all ties in with what exactly what he was doing at what he's doing and and he solved the problem. He's created this sanitation system that is just completely revolutionary and I don't want to spoil it for you for other people are going to watch it, but it's exactly what you just said. He's gone out there. He's looked at problems and he said right I'm going to use my money. I'm going to use my brain and I'm going to fix it and It's changed my opinion of him completely. I've heard a lot of respect for him now, but that this book also I think is is is going to be one that I'm going to read because it's it sounds like it's saying the same thing so Tim, what do you have? Well first you have to endure sceeto's selection because Man's Search for meaning is the most inspiring book I've ever read and it's extremely extremely affecting in every sense of the word. So to go from the sublime to the Nicholas I'm gonna go for well, I'm here too because there's a connection between them. The first is Bohemian Rhapsody. And so I saw recently always sort of thought. Yeah Freddie Mercury. Yeah higher pick which is nothing really very special but it's very entertaining. Yes, hugely crowd-pleasing entertainment. The critics hated it the good excited it while it's great. It's quite it's eminently watchable and for anyone of a certain age, I mean queen was just all over the 70s and most of the a 80s now I never bought the queen record, but but you have to admit they they gave good rock. Oh definitely. I was very lucky to go to all the early Queen concerts. I really yeah, you are privileged. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I just I would go to other gigs that my friends were talking about and I would say God this is this is rubbish, you know, because I'm my first few get wise to go to the Marquee Club in London and say a lot of small bands which were great. But my first Stadium gig was a queen gig so I was like, Let me spoil on the Waterworks tool and when it came to Live Aid I wasn't surprised I was like the other band States quote great and some other bands were great. But you know, I'd like Sade playing bass line for 10 minutes before they actually got into their song Along Comes Queen and just like blows everyone knows everyone knows everyone else away in that I knew that this is what they would do because I'd seen them before the other. The other one is another Netflix production called the spy with Sacha Baron. Aaron Cohen, I don't know if you know the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen Dido. He has it Borat and yeah things but this is as far as I'm aware his first serious acting role. There is a major first. It's a very good film. It's a series of day. I think it's a six part series on Netflix very very the true life story of a Israeli spy who infiltrated the the top level of the Syrian government quite incredible true life story, but Sacha Baron Cohen is outstandingly good in this and the reason I mention the connections because I believe Sacha Baron Cohen was originally lined up to play for any Mercury. Yes. He was yes, he's I think he's brilliant the Common Thread here because we've talked about this a bit in the past is it seems easier much easier for good Comics to become good serious dramatic actors either way around I believe so I'd interesting. I mean, I think it's much harder to do what he's done in the past, you know his comedic work than and I I wouldn't be surprised if his acting is absolutely outstanding, but but Guido look, thank you so much for your time, and there's something	1.0
Well, so are the way our schedule works is, you know, obviously if Some of the NFR then we don't do anything until the end of March as far as rodeos are concerned. I don't go to Texas or anything like that. I just use a stay home and Buchholz and do that kind of thing for how my program works is I will I turn to start out March 1st. I leave I leave our studs out for 45 days to 60 days depending on you know, how the weather you know, like I If there's like a feel like they've got two good Cycles. in then then that's when I pull them if if I don't feel like that then in I just I anyway I just want to make sure that I get them covered and I try and do it within two months if I miss if the stud Miss isn't there, I just absorb it and I don't worry about it because I don't need Colts too late because again, it could screw your deal, but I messed up my schedule because I booked the mirrors that I breed and and how I do it is so A good example is like wild and blue and tnf are just a couple of months ago or three months ago, whatever it's been now and she had a cult couple days ago some so she you know, so the turnaround time is so she's bucking the pmf are you know, eight and a half nine months bread. But then she'll she you know has these this winter off. She has her Colton case. I live in California. It's pretty nice where we live it's cold right now, but for the most part it's not too bad in the winters. She'll have she'll have, you know have her cult usually and February or 1st of March and then I will only leave the Colts with the mayor's from Fort same deal as the as the breeding cycle 45 to 60 days and then I and I ween them called too young and I A month as much hay as they'd like as much like they have free choice Alfalfa and then I feed them grain and cast Mana to get them going and and it does two things. It gets my mayor back on the road so I can get a rodeo on again. But it also makes you cold it's good to be around and pretty gentle. So, you know, they come they come to feed and and and they get used to being around people. So they're not they're not real wild went for later on and and then they don't get a little go ahead you obviously they get free choice Alfalfa and good feed but you don't have a problem with them growing just like from not being with her mom. Actually we've done it we've done a test because you've had I've had that question happen a lot and I've actually had the cult that Our on on hey and calf man and grain outperform the Colts that are on the mayor still I'll be done. Yeah, and and I think that's because we don't know how much milka mares producing you think, you know, but you don't know how much the calls getting and and so, you know, it's no different than the cow-calf deal the cow-calf guys, you know, you'll have Pals that always bring in a calf at a great wing and wait and then you got not count bring in a calf with a very good weaning weight. So you just can the cow or whatever they do and get a different cow. Well, it's not that way in the Bucking Horse World where you don't just because America doesn't produce good milk. That doesn't mean we don't want to keep raising cold side where we just going to find a different way to take care of that baby and get big and strong because you know, the maternal ability might not be there on that matter, but the Bucks in them, right? So we got to kind of and going back to what we were talking about earlier this Rocking horse deal isn't like the Bulls deal. You know, it's it's a lot harder. I mean that they just they're so there to get a really shiny bucking horse. It takes a lot of lot of breeding and and a lot of luck and a lot of work. We're in the bull deal. I don't I don't want to discredit the bull deal because it's and say that it's easy. I don't mean it like that because it's hard as well because you only get like half your cash crop, but at the same time You can go and and you know breed Mudslinger to a Houdini daughter and you're gonna have a pretty good chance of a cast that box. I mean pretty good chance, you know, sorry.	-1.0

I got a call about my son's speech. Meaning and how they're like, well we can see and go through this process and it didn't like you want them to be good kids and you want them to be healthy and but yeah, then what if something is not quite right? How do you fix it? And I think the other thing with anxiety that I've kind of noticed just from other people in my life is I don't know exactly how to say it but like a lot of times people are anxious because they don't have a job. Job, or they don't have money, but you can't like you need resources and you need help but it takes money to have those resources. I know and so like just yesterday. So my sons having a really hard time at drop off still and it's it's a lot and so I contacted this place and they're like, oh we're out of network. It's going to be like three hundred fifty dollars for the screening and you know, so it's like, okay. I'm trying to deal with this thing. I'm trying to You know, I'm trying to do the right things, but I can't spend $500 on a problem that lasts 5 minutes in the morning, you know, so I think that's the other thing that's tricky about mental health is that first of all, you have to want to get help because I don't know how many people I've tried to help and if they don't want to get better sure they can't they're never going to get better. But even people that do want help sometimes it's it's hard financially to to get the help that you need.	-1.0

Yeah, that was terrible. It's just I mean, it's interesting because you saw Valentina read the other teens were having like a You looking club and she was so concerned about the club looking nice that she didn't think about the concept of who did you say was this you who were you referring to Valentina Valentina? Okay. Yeah. She's shading the other teams for not having it look nice. Right, but but there's the concept ended up being not as strong as the other one trunks doesn't look nice, but they do well. I'm usually drunk when I go in there so and then Naomi ended up fronting most of the work because like Valentina wasn't helping like write the scripts and she was kind of like joking on joking around while they were trying to like paint the set which is funny to watch but then you're thinking like if I was Naomi I would be I would probably be more like tents and visibly nervous. Because I would be like no dude. We need to get this props to her for like kind of caring that team. I feel like Valentina and I went back into her old because she'd kind of the same thing last her season when she wasn't like studying the words like she kind of just coasted through it and that what's in her home. So I felt like Valentine just like missed the mark on this missed the mark this episode. So I think so too. I just felt bad for her.	-1.0

You know like this is what are you supposed to do if there's to moving objects that you're supposed to keep on the screen. It's kind of impossible to fix but then this game for some reason it doesn't have that same issue. And even though there's like seven or eight enemies on the screen for some reason. I don't think about it. It's almost as if like the game was made with the intention of the camera as well, you know, like as a mechanic versus like making a level making a boss and then having a camera there like that's sort of what Dark Souls kind of fell into but it's true.	1.0

Yeah, so it wasn't series of events. So my contractor Lend-Lease was coming to an end my lease at my unit in could you was coming to an end? And in all of that I had been following the twins from The Block on Instagram and I then say that they went and did some home staging course with this International Institute a home staging which was quite new to me. So then I am International Institute of home staging put on kind of a seminar in Sydney back in 2015, and I just thought I'll just go and see what it's all about. And that literally was my lightbulb moment. This is actually what I want to do for the rest of my life is home staging so there was a series of events and I think the universe kind of led me to that seminar that Naomi had put on in Sydney back in 2015. And the rest is history So within that three months of attending that seminar I was back in Beaker and rather home staging was born that's amazing how quickly it's happened.	1.0
Green, yeah, it wasn't a lot of nobody smelled.	-1.0
And did you did you didn't play it dude? I was at work. Yeah, unfortunately not. I saw you as making game though.	1.0
Yeah. I've heard amazing things about running. Pins out and I know a few people who've done it and yeah, it's I hear it's quite pricey but I don't sort of events are have to be pricing to enter Because it loving logistic is a lot going on forever the races at Daddy but we have a race but I like the South Australia's version of run their Pinta. It's not a stage race, but we have the Hubert 100 down in the Flinders ranges you get and yeah. I'm there every year and it's a fantastic location. There's a 100K in a 100-mile option and there's a couple shorter off TV. Well, it seems like something that you'd be in. Juvie. And I know I'm always really innovating and some Americans the other day and I got I think I've convinced them to ensure it have an eye - you know there.	1.0
She who mislead don't know I do that. Laughs. It's you like try to do it on purpose. I know so the first time I do and then the second time it actually comes out. Yeah, it goes ha ha ha ha ha ha was that it for the sponsored by Pepsi flee? Oh during Pepsi if you're hearing this we need the money.	1.0
She's like, oh she's saying we can't we're not supposed to have any throw. It's fucking food for like an hour so that our class all together like in the same classroom.	-1.0
Right.	1.0
Big fat and gone who's taking this down years ago in John New Haven. I like it years ago in New Haven Connecticut. There was a tree on the green that supposedly a Jesus face on it. And I've not seen the tree but I'm gonna guarantee you it did not have Jesus face on it. It's just like my God. That's a guess. It's a guess.	0.0
And I agree and that's kind of the thing. I've been kind of working on for weeks. And you look at the to Iowa tight ends. I said, no laughs and is Jordan Reed 2.0 T. Jay Hawkins kind of Chris Cooley or me is ceiling would be like a Jason winner Greg Olsen, but I think Fant your said is much more Dynamic his Arias of nine point eight nine. His combine was absolutely incredible and he was a pretty good player for a long time and I will Hawkins to really broke out last year, but fantas been doing it for two three years now and Kirk Ferentz players tend to do pretty well in the end. Whether it's George Kettle, we've seen Now setting records or Scott Shannon had a nice long career in the NFL as well. So Iowa tight ends tend to do pretty well in the NFL and I think there's a solid chance as well that one of them will be in Green Bay for me personally. I am actually in Amber with Brian Burns and all those concerns about his frame and everything, but the Packers need that edge Turner we look at the Smiths. They're very very good players, but having a guy with the speed and build of a Brian Burns gives it that extra dynamic. Thing where you could have all three of them on the field and really cause problems with that as well. But like you said there are so many guys in play at 12 and maybe even trading down into the late teens to get fans or treating up from 30 to get fan because I would be surprised if they take 10 players with with the capitulate is and with with the chance to really get some special players. I think they might trade up a couple of times on maybe they won or at the very least day to as well. Well, I think said to do you think you want to maybe hop into a little bit of a mock draft here before for us?	1.0
Yeah, absolutely. It's just she just she just was never	1.0
You know, maybe there's a box of cereal out or a container of some sort of sauce that people tend to leave out maybe some seasonings that need to be put away.	-1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and then what have you got planned because like this is probably some of the best best years of your life really like where you have these massive summer holidays where you finish finish in November and then don't start again until Feb March. What else have you got planned? You obviously got the Phillip Island trip. You got anything planned over Christmas or January?	1.0
But the thing that's what I was thinking.	0.0
I keep seeing people who love the trade machine and you can hear Linus who really is sick of reading about fake traits to and there are people inside organizations no names, please that all they do is sit there and try to dream up trades for people that are higher up try to find that fair value and target people. That's all they do all day long.	1.0
They make pretty cool gear. They make the snagger tool which we talked about. I've seen it used.	1.0
I mean that's a pretty heavy burden it is but you know, when that's again when this is all you're seeing, you know, and then I go back into my own family and I see the patterns of fatherlessness and if that's all you know it and that's what's normal, you know, so this is what all my friends felt, you know what I mean? It's set for the to now the two who knew their fathers. Love them. You know what I mean? Love them. They I got a lot of juice for them and I learned through their Actions, you know on how to parent like you said earlier actively like they was always around one of my boys is you know, you had four boys they let me times like you need a new you 16 need a car. I'm here. He was still cool with their moms at if it's something broke at their house. He would come through fix, you know, if they had barbecues he was still around, you know, and my other friend is his parents were still married. So, you know that that but his father wasn't was another one that was like, you know, I was like I ain't Because you just you get to see the living blueprint, you know of black father who specifically when you when your dad passed.	1.0
But it looks like it's yeah downstairs and you go down there like playing beautifully and you're like, oh my God, I hate you. I want to have more play dates.	-1.0

Okay? When okay, so month of celebration for squeaks. Okay. I don't think we're too early in the podcast. They just start handing squeaks today.	1.0
Isn't this episode's sponsored by two guys in a hot tub by feet away because in that ye dudes don't be aware of it. Laughs. Yeah, we couldn't get over it. Ha ha ha and instantly the podcast is like because it's like more natural in the podcast. I had boys who's going first to new stuff from last week. Alright, well more about this week today or at the school. Oh, yeah, what the fuck out there was a gas leak in her school.	1.0
All right, so I do want to say we appreciate everybody who's a patron we did who has supported us with some money. You can you can throw some money at us. If you want on patreon. You can just throw us a rating or review on Apple or Stitcher. You can comment on individual episodes on YouTube. We do want to take a minute to remind you that it's Christmas season might have to do some shopping to do have a merch shop bunch of stuff that says Dad and buried on it.	1.0
So very interesting. I'm curious me. Yep. You've got your fingers on the pulse of this industry from the standpoint of what's coming and going what we're going to see in the coming years. What are you interested in?	1.0
Oh, absolutely, you know performance and you know, what's the three p's Prodigy performance and pedigree? And so that that's you know, that's that's the three the three Deals in the whatever it is the beef business everybody looks at those and I look at it kind of the same way in the in the bucket Bowl deal. You know, you gotta gotta have those ingredients. Obviously. We you can't have Prodigy if you've never read them, but You know, that's the third leg of that if if that you know, somebody does cross that bridge will then and breeds one of them both. Well, that's great.	1.0
Um, so yeah finding a professional that works will be that's not homophobic. That isn't crazy. ABS is not easy all the time. Genuinely and where that hasn't been through anything. So we're like well, maybe you should meditate. Yeah, you're just not going to buy with some of them. Yeah, like, you know, like when you're going to school if I go to like college, I went to UMass for three years and there were so many girls that were getting psyched agrees. That just made me laugh because I was like, you literally have no empathy but you don't understand through any psyche at all because you learn you can read about it in a book. Yeah you can read about Like anxiety, but if you don't have anxiety, you just don't know what it's like. Yeah, and these are the same girls that II that something goes wrong with their friends they call up their fucking mental health with their school and send them away. You know, like they do not there they do not know or care even to take the time to understand the emotion that you're feeling. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of it is just like making an effort to understand what your friends are going through and like my thing is Don't treat people the way you want to be treated treat them the way they want to be treated sometimes like yes and have you don't understand? Yeah, like yeah. We're not the same time just to say yeah, how can I support you? Hmm? Yeah, like I've been having a rough month my good friend just said what can I do to make sure that you're safe and to provide you support that's really weird. And if we're good sighs. Do you want to give you want to give your friend support? Yep, without being their therapist. You can still ask for support like that's where humans me. That you know, yep, and I literally told her send me a meme or two. I'll hit you up when I need you. Yeah, sometimes it's as simple as a setting for someone that's sad like so and just being like I'm here, you know living in talk. We cannot talk we can watch TV at like my presence shows that I care. Definitely. I don't have the words for it. Yeah, you know. So I guess that's how to help a depressed friend is just to be there for them. Yeah and like and not give up on them. Even if they don't come to all your social Gatherings key inviting them. Yeah, because they want to know the people still love them. Yeah, and that just reinforces like, oh no one loves me like, you know, just like invite them places, like even if they don't go like kind of have the expectation that like if you're like plans are going to like if you make plans with them like they might fall through and like that's okay like be kind to them. Yeah. Be understanding and if they're really pissed about something like I do is with my family too and like they probably need a little extra love. Yeah. Yeah and just let them be angry, you know exiled them a little extra love when they're feeling really intense emotions because even though that's when you want to love them the least until they needed the most definitely, you know, yeah like the other day. My mom was in a really really bad mood yelling at me for no reason and I instead of being like upset. I was just like I just walked up to her and gave her a hug and just it was just like how how like and she started crying and I wasn't so she was sad. Yeah, you know and I was just like so like I immediately was like, okay. She probably needs a little extra love definitely. These kids came into my work the other day and they said some sick shit. They were like, oh when I was a kid, I used to feed alka-seltzers to seagulls. So they would blow up what the heck and I literally like my heart actually started in my chest. I feel so sick and I just said dude. Can you come across the counter? I'm going to give you a hug because apparently your parents never Hugged you you don't just do that if you got hugs, so I came around the counter and I gave him a big hug. We said I'm a pretty messed-up guy that said you should go to therapy. You said, you know what? I'm considering it and then we talked about therapy. That's another thing and that see that is not the response. He was looking for he was looking for me to be like had a heavy that Titans of the bird. Hey Emma. No I said I said yo your parents didn't hug you. Yeah, that's it. That's an animal. You know what I mean? Like could have been like what kind of sick fuck are you would yeah, sick fuck regardless. Don't get me wrong. But do I want him to go on to be a serial killer? No show him. Why don't ya	1.0
So like I'm good, okay, but act like you can't handle a big dick, please hardly. Mmm. You could handle it if you really had to if I had to if I was meeting to yeah, if it's like, oh, I like this deck or no ticket. I mean you would choose no. No, I'm not there's no digging. I often choose. No Jacob. It's like you can go to bed or you can like travel to a dick on.	-1.0
Well after my brain went, you know, I feel like it's time for us to do the hottest new special segment. Yes, Riverdale Riverdale rants guys, but I can so yeah.	1.0
I remember when he first signed me my maker speaker Mike Lewis and he was like Eno player. He's awful. We wouldn't say he's going to be real we wouldn't be where we are today without bond. It was like it was awful my offer.	-1.0
So today we're going to talk about a subject the subject of kindness we I know that you know as teachers we are hopefully modeling kindness and our classroom kindness on the playground kindless with our peers kindness with their peers because the students the students are looking at you they're noticing you they're watching you and so I was reading an article the other day and found not an unsurprising but it's still a little bit of alarming statistics about what teachers are seeing in their classroom teachers are reporting about a 30% increase in bullying or unkind Behavior being displayed over the last couple of years. It's not surprising but it's still alarming. I think it's not surprising because we are seeing more bullying type of behavior or unkind Behavior through different types of social media channels the way people interact with each other and so students are noticing children are noticing what they're seeing and it's coming back into our classroom. So I thought today would be a great time to talk about kind. This how we how do we Foster kindness in her classroom? And Adam is first of all, one of the kindest people. I know I'm not just saying that because he's staring at me like I totally feel that way and if you've met him before I know that you agree, but he also does some really specific things in his classroom to help Foster that kindness and so I thought maybe Adam you could speak to that.	1.0
Exactly.	1.0
Yeah, all the above are the first year was man of massively green behind the ears and it was a it happened to be a very hot year as well. It was the race was only a couple of years old at that point and I remember I ran out of water in 2013 I ran out of water going About the halfway point which is a really tough section because you you're alone for 22 kilometers and then but yeah, so ever since then I'm a lot more on to it with with what I'm going to like. I'm onto it more with just everything. I've learned a lot more about running about the course and about pacing and so yeah, so this year was it was it was a good run for me wasn't perfect. But I don't think they'll ever be a perfect race, but I'm very pleased with my time and I thought I might take you through a little bit and if I know there's some fruit if 10 is perfect.	1.0
It's almost as interesting as your son's fucking toenails cookie.	-1.0
Yep. There you go. Number three is the Thunderdome. I feel like when we were talking about it was like Thunderdome needs to make top three because the Thunderdome it's just fun, aesthetically as far as like the different levels that you have the different buildings you can Weighs almost guarantee a purple and like I'd say anywhere from seven to eight out of ten times. It'll be right in the center. So if you time it just right you can land like right next to it was like yeah purple armor.	1.0
I'm sorry, we're gonna bring mergent.	0.0
But the Imagine working in a way to finding dogs.	0.0
So yeah, one of the statistics that's out there because it seems like Like we whenever there's a discussion about fatherlessness or the father not being in the home. It just makes his way into our community right when the research shows that more than any other racial group. It turns out that black fathers are more involved in terms of you know, childcare reading to their kids like activities like black flower fathers are ranked essentially number one and you know, we know that obviously being you know, The the product of out of wedlock, you know marriage or whatever or I don't like situation. That doesn't mean your father isn't around right and so people sometimes conflate those two. Now you mentioned it was like something that happened. What was the incident that kind of sparked all is well.	1.0

She is like wait, do you only send yours on Snapchat or because they disappear or do you text them? First of all, I don't really send them to anyone if we're being very clear. I send them to you I keep them for myself to look at because I'm like, wow. Damn. I look good. Yeah for the very small number of people that have received them. They had been on Snapchat. There's only been one person that they've been texted to and that's because he doesn't have Snapchat.	1.0
Okay. Well, I started something over here. I'm stepping away from the microphone to refill the champagne. I'll be back.	1.0

Little more at the soul just way at their business just wait at their belief in themselves opinions get inside and poison this phone this world is filled with smart people who didn't make it smart people. They lost. Hope smart people. They gave up smart people who lack the courage to listen to the voice inside that says, yes, I can't Dad, listen to society who said most people don't most people fail. It's to risk play it safe. I will not play it safe. I don't feel too fat less than my potential. No, it is not too late. It's now time to regain your power. You know, it's not too late.

Now we both made it. I was the one that almost died. But anyways, I'll continue. I just closed my story is like such a high school thing to happen. So like we were all sleeping in tents or whatever.

I know I have Joe finished lacrosse season. I was like, ooh Flex that Bobby likes.	-1.0
I think yeah, I think that's going to be the one thing that's going to be a little bit of a struggle in the type fall to a campaign. Like I was just like you I bought Titanfall 2 on sale like probably 20 bucks. It was yeah, it definitely wasn't on release and bought it for the campaign because my friends were telling me I had needed to play the game but I got caught up in the multiplayer. I think I was playing the multiplayer for a month before I actually decided okay. I'm going to To pick away at the campaign and the campaign honestly is a lot shorter than what you expect. Right? Yeah, you don't have to dedicate too long to it. But the moment I finished that campaign Titanfall instantly became one of my favorite games of all time. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't want to blow the ending and it will hear our kids though. I mean the story itself is probably the reason why a lot of people are a big Titanfall 2 fans, but the whole Apex Legends reference Reference I think that was that's like really really cool. And I know that the I hope that they respond cut it does the same thing they did with Titanfall 2 was they sometimes had a little bit of lore that they would add on to the game in general, but you had to find on the internet in terms of like like scripted cartoons or something, but I hope that they do that with Apex just to give a bit more background to all the characters and I don't know about the whole Jack Cooper Legend to like I would love that. Yeah, but I feel like his ability is might be a bit o p yeah.	1.0
Yeah, this is almost as perfect as it gets and I can almost guarantee. There's going to be craziness on draft night and only Brian gudykunst in his team know who they're looking at and what they're looking for particularly and all we can do is sit here and speculate based off the team needs, but it's fairly how it goes, isn't it? So I can't wait for the draft personally, but if they at they ended up with this kind of Hall addressing so many positions with the value that we got and want Thornhill Debo Samuel Noah fans. I'd be over the moon and I great also folks.	1.0
Yeah. I was like Brandon said that you guys were going tomorrow and Thursday.	1.0
It was surreal. So, you know soju. Comes out and you know, it's just like, you know poison Hood came out. It was just like we felt like it was this new movement. You know hip-hop is everything is happening at the same time like you go back to that time frame. You can't just look back at my career. You gotta look it with hip-hop is that you got look at everything to inform you of how it felt to me because it was just like we just felt like we were at the tip of something, you know crazy happening right now. And if and for the culture this overuse were now but that's what this was like the the second birth of the culture and then, you know book this movie to program which for me was, you know again, I thought I was gonna play football. So now I'm getting to live out this kind of thing and the writer director of that film David Ward, he wrote major league and so while we were filming the program he was like, you know, I guess there's something contractually was happening with Wesley Snipes who played in the original Because I didn't really want to do majorly to that wasn't my cup of tea. But again that loyalty thing I'm like yo this dude gave me my second job site. Let's go rock. So when rock with that and then Higher Learning, I think John Singleton originally wanted to POC to play Malik, but then pop got locked up. And so then the, you know getting higher learning it was it was a glorious time. It was a great time. It was like, you know the to taste your dreams and to get to live them out is invaluable, you know, and You know, you know you making a little bit of money and you know, you just for me it was like surreal I was so young when this whole process by the time that I'm not even 21 by the time you know, Higher Learning is coming out. So it's just like boom boom. Boom.	1.0

So this has Sterling would say he is the honey when a customer uses a Retailer's app. Sandbox Commerce is able to collect data about those customers for the retailer. The assumption is of course that this will help them better Market to these customers Amazon for example has an insane amount of data on people's buying habits and they use it to sell more stuff. But if you're a retailer that sells on Amazon you don't get access to that info Amazon Hogs that sweet sweet data for themselves now you Sandbox, Commerce retailers will have their own little stockpile of data.

Great. And like the reason that number goes back or the reason, you know, your weight comes back. And in fact, there are studies that show that in only like less than five percent of people can sustain intentional weight loss after a period of dieting meaning that 95% of the time and after a period of one to three years post diet you're going to gain that weight back and the reason why is because your body wants to be at a state of homeostasis, which means that it's keeping things at you know, your your internal set point of what is a normal and healthy weight for you and that number is different for different people based off of your Or metabolism your genes your culture so many lifestyle factors. So it's not that simple to just think. Oh, I you know, I'm going to go on a diet. I'm going to lose this weight and it's just going to stay off your body has so many complex mechanisms and Pathways to actually restore that weight that it wants you to be at and there's a reason it wants you to be at that weight and that weight is different person to person. So, you know, if you think that just adopting your favorite like And influencers diet and nutrition and fitness habits is going to allow you to have that person's body. It's just not because you have a completely different DNA blueprint than them.	-1.0

I'm like a battered girl and I'm just like, why do I love you? Because I mean like in general like Battlefield. That's the only reasonable not only reason I mean, there's plenty of reasons, but that's like one of the only reasons I didn't buy Battlefield 5 is the fact that EA has Been doing some really questionable things in the past. And I mean, I tried the beta out for Battlefield 5 and it was very much like okay, this is more Battlefield and it wasn't a bad thing necessarily. It's just that like when I looked at that plus all the other things coming out around it. I was like that $60 just ended up going somewhere else now technically now, I think I could probably end up picking up on like a really good deal or something, but then that's still like money that I'd have to put towards that instead of something.	-1.0

And I guess you're like you said, they're very complementary businesses. But at the end of the day, they're still two separate businesses and different. In the in the sense that although the obviously there's some crossover in the fact that you've got home Wares and things that you can use in staging as well one is still a retail store and one is a service. How do you find running two businesses that are very different at the same time?	0.0
Big fox big facts, so there you go people still no no concrete release date yet. But again, we will keep you all updated on adventures during this 3 because that is definitely my most anticipated project of this year so far. Let's get into the album reviews. We have one album that we are going to review today and that is going to be offset father of four now all set as head of hair. The 2018 the man has been getting it be for people. He got married secretly. He had a child with cardi B and he's been in his share of scandals. Not only did he get into some beef with with Chris Brown. Soulja Boy is going to come at them a little bit. And of course the whole cheating scandal which had pretty much everybody who was a cardi B fan on his head and saying that he was piece of shit and all that stuff. He was supposed to actually release his album last year. Here but ended up getting pushed back and I'm sure that it got pushed back because of all the scandals that he just had to try to salvage his relationship him and cardi end up getting separated for a little bit. But now they're back together taking care of the child and looks like they're being a family and they for the most part gotten through all of that stuff because that's what people when you love somebody. That's what you do. You got to fight to keep your girl and when he ended up bringing out the project, you know, The Breakfast Club and actually respected what he said on the interview, it seems like he's He's evolved and reflected a lot. I know that everybody is Presley these blind fans and want to just automatically condemn somebody if they do one bad thing or they do a couple bad things. But at the end of the day that's his wife, and that's that's his baby mamas life or his wife's like that ain't your life. So who are you to judge when you're on the outside looking in like that's not your thing that you have to go through and it seemed like all say realize that it specially in their Breakfast Club interview and on this album it. Definitely reflected a lot of like what he was going through. He definitely had multiple songs about his children about cardi situation. He apologized and million times on it and it seemed like he actually wants to be a better husband and a better a better father to his the newborn and his other three kids that he had with his other baby mamas now, obviously as far as talent wise talent and celebrity wise, I don't think we know any of them compared to cardi B and even if they did I'm pretty sure cars if he's gonna The biggest baby mama at all I know but but they're still you know, not to not to discredit any other any other baby mamas we had children with but obviously he you know loves all of them just the same and I just think that he's overall just grew as a person which people can do so for this particular album has 16 songs total features Big rule. Shout out to be a group. That's definitely a huge huge thing and Atlanta Jayco Jay Cole been doing a lot of features. I'm actually very Why did he just keep jumping on features? So that's that's pretty well gonna yeah, see low on here Travis guy 21 Savage cardi B. Quavo and Gucci Mane and I will say my favorite songs from this album would be quarter. Millie clout wild wild west and how did I get here? Now as far as this album compared to the other solo albums by takeoff and quavo. I gotta say that I think offsets out. Was the best I would have we said that that was going to happen. Yeah, but I think that we were a little bit worried just because when take off sound came out that was it was very underwhelming. So a lot of people like man, why don't all says I was gonna be but I think that again he had the best album after listening to it. I think he has some really good features. I think that in and this might be a hot take here is might be unpopular opinion. I think the offset out of the Migos is probably the most versatile. Especially after hearing this album. I thought that quavo initially was quavo the hood guy and you know, he he's a good songwriter or whatever. He definitely definitely rent some songs first Ojai name artist, but I think that quavo just kind of got to take a step back because quavo really isn't the lyrical dude. I think they offset is like takeoff and quavo mixing the one I think that he has a bigger a bigger bigger repertoire that Really propels him above his other counterparts and I think they really showed on this album, especially with the features. I didn't find one feature to be like out of place or sound weird North Star was CeeLo Green CeeLo. Green killed that obviously had big Ruban the very first song Father for J. Cole killed and on. How did I get here? Cardi B actually think our DB I'll wrap them which is funny on clout. I think the party be gonna kill - I would like, whoa, I'll say whoa. This is gotta is kind of	1.0
That's what having kids is all about.	-1.0
No, I agree with you. And so let's go with it. Brian Burns who again is my draft Crush. So I trust you with Brian Burns again long athletic. He was a productive player at Florida State and he all he does is make plays he can really get after the quarterback. And as we as we've seen from tape with the Chiefs and what Mike Smith likes to do with the outside linebackers, he will get that football. He will get a lot of strip sacks and that is built exactly for what the Packers can do. So as we move to pick 30, so kind of recapping what happened. After Brian Burns was taken by Green Bay and 12 Drew lock goes to Miami at 13 Christian Wilkins to the Falcons DK Medcalf to Washington Jonah Williams to the Panthers replace Matt Khalil a Cleveland Pharrell to the Giants Dalton Reisner to the Vikings. That's gonna hurt Ross Cody Ford to the Titans Devin Bush to the Steelers greedy Williams to Seattle. That's a really good fit there Camille Harry your Arizona State boy to Baltimore Garrett Bradbury to Didn't Josh Jacobs to the Raiders Chauncey Gardiner Johnson the safety from Florida to the Eagles Hakeem Butler to the Colts TJ Hawkinson goes to the Raiders at 27 Byron Murphy cornerback from Washington to the LA Chargers and Mack Wilson from Alabama to the Chiefs. There's a normal name that I didn't just read and I think we're going to take him a 13. That's probably no offense.	1.0

So this one, you know, we said I think we mentioned last time that he's the whole thing that he keeps saying is that we can play well for spells, but we need to be able to play well for 90 minutes and we're not at that level yet. We're working towards its what yesterday and we're getting closer because it's not just a 45 minutes and then the second half there's a little crossover. A little you know about an hour or so we play well for now, but it's when we do play with and 90 minutes, I think will bloat.	1.0
Well you do like you do like, you know Q went on to become like a record executive and Bishop had a baby. No one knew about that. They found and he raps now, so he's signing up him here.	1.0

It seems like he built a really great product and can totally see retailers using a I just want to understand is this a 10 million hundred million billion 10 billion dollar Marty six billion dollar market. So, how do you so let me tell you how I would think about Market size images you say you're going after the Middle Market right 10 million 250 million hundred ten million 100 million in Revenue. I think about Market size is how many retailers exist in that sort of bucket. How many of them don't have an A. Nap and what's your sort of annual price per retailer really backing through to the market? I just worry that we're going after a nice hundred million dollar market but not a ten billion dollar market, excellent. So the total addressable addressable Market our addressable Market is 6 as 36 billion dollars currently right now, but you and that's yeah, you can't think you can't think of it as total retail Stan you got to think about it as what Revenue can we get from our Target? But he said that their issues billion years being spent by these retailers on mobile. If you look you're not going to get right you're gonna we're gonna work.	-1.0

So well, it's been you know initially like in the in the heat of it Josh and then the heat of it like as I'm leaving the pitch back, you know back in Austin. I'm on cloud and Cloud Nine I go through all the steps, you know, it's important for me to be persistent with all investors including James and initially it was tough. If it was very tough because that it felt like a lock when I walked off of the off of the stage. Yeah, and so initially it sucked and worst case scenario of everything bust that we've got a whole lot of other great things going on for us. So we're not you know, I can't I'm not going to dwell on that because I'd still be stuck there and not making the progress we're making right now.	-1.0

So I know I didn't take off fast. I'm jumping here because my brain doesn't work here - come on me. I'm still covering. I think I may have got got some brain damage. No, so I didn't take off fast. The first k I felt very comfortable first sort of 500 meters or so. I felt very comfortable. But there was a big pack of guys blocking the track in front and then we came came we came to the first style and climbing arnall and then you're waiting you just standing there and then I thought there's going to be so much of this waiting. And so what I did I thought I'm just going to get myself some space and I like so I jumped when I climbed over a style. I just accelerated and I broke away and I I just I wanted to put a bit of space between me and the group because I just got sick of this is where local knowledge comes into its own. Yeah, and so I known as I pushed her and I felt great which was a good feeling, you know, like I didn't feel like I was running threshold or anything else till conversational. But yes, I was running about five minute case in that first couple of kilometers and and running you're running through paddocks already and through long grass and and the lead At that point I was in second place. So Andrew Hoff who's a phenomenal Runner who I interviewed on the podcast a while back. He was already after a kilometer. He was already a couple hundred meters in front. And so and then he disappeared and went on to break the course record broke broke Brandon Davies course record, and I think he got 9 hours and 43 minutes so which is phenomenal and he's and I would dare say that and Who's not even in the best shape of his life yet? And so he's just a good runner. But anyway, so I'm running and I probably about the first ten kilometers. There's no major. There's a fair Climate about kilometer 6 to 7, where you go up this long road, we your dirt road and you just it's a it's a just a grinding uphill climb and there was me and this other this young bloke will running together second third for all of that and just we'll just check. But we will just sort of holding a reasonable pace and then we came down through the forest into Inman Valley which is checkpoint 1 and about that would be it about kilometer 16 and I was very quick turnaround. I got I filled up my my my bladder filled up grab some food said Thank you to the volunteers and then we were off again and So from from checkpoint one to the next checkpoint to is your where it starts to get a little bit tough, you know, so you there's only five checkpoints in the whole race. And so you really got to be self-sufficient and I was feeling really good at this point. I was just like yeah loving it conditions are good legs feel good. Everything felt good. So I kept running a bit well, and then there's a fair grind as you going up another Hill and you work your way on these Road Hills until You come to the first technical section, which is not until about kilometer 24 23 24, maybe. Yeah 24 and your head into my ponga Conservation Park, which is go so you're going from running on these dirt roads. It's very runnable, even though there's some climbing to the some of the most technical terrain you can get and it's a this is the part that breaks people really early. This is actually where I had my first low point. So you're going to my ponga their traffic is it just yet was there for a second?	1.0

So so they praised Jay-Z for that too and sucks a snowman. Yeah. It really does artists that can go overseas like you said. Yeah, man, that's that's huge when people like I don't think people know how rewarding it is that when someone that don't even speak the language no every word of your song and appreciate your music. That's crazy. Like a lot of people think that's weird here. Like somebody come over here ramp rapping in French or something like that or Germany, like what the hell is that? Like it's very rare that one of those type of songs pop here in the US. It's been a couple that would like most of the songs is like not even in language, but it's extremely rare for when they hold. Olga celebrated like that. That's that's tremendous. It just goes to show that the rest of the world is like, you know a lot more appreciative of good music than we are here.	1.0

Well then just think about remember at sdcc where they had that thing where they were reading the fan fiction. And in fact, that's kind of how we originally got involved with Edie and we were actually on her side because she was like that was disgraceful like they had him reading this big but it was purely to make fun of it and purely the laugh at the author was fine, but it was like still that's not a good look. Yeah. Yeah and And then that on top of Jeff's whole thing that Linden let slip where Jeff was like, you know, they told us no, in fact, I think Hoechlin even said it in an interview in Dillon to maybe we've been like don't look at any of the fan art don't look at any of the fanfic. I'll do that. I'll take care of that for you. I'll respond to that for you. You don't have to deal with that and I was just like side I now for the collective that what so the reason people found out about it.

What are some things that are acceptable today by the world that is So beating it to God or that's exposing like are weak faith in God, right? Because sir, I in chapter 16 verse 3 sir. I took matters into her own hands by giving hag are to her husband Abraham, right her weak faith in God. She said God has prevented me from having children. She had trouble believing God's promise like Abraham in chapter 12, right, which says let's go back to chapter 12. God said God. I mean God told him that are I'm sorry. No in chapter 12 when he goes to Egypt and is like look you are a very beautiful woman. He says this to Sarai when the Egyptian see you they will say this is his wife. Let's kill him. And we can have her so please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life in treat me well because of their interest in you. So here's the thing Abraham's lack of faith that God would protect him. He took matters into his own hands write and tell Sarah to act as his sister and it creates all these problems while they're in Egypt same thing with Sarah when she took matters into her own hands because she had trouble believing God's promise out of this lack of Faith came a series of problems now. I want you to think of our your life or I'm thinking of my life right now how this happens when we take over for God right trying to make his promises come true through efforts that are not in line with his specific directions. Sometimes God gives us a promise. Sometimes we hear God calling us like, okay like	1.0

So I think I thought about this one and that there's two things that I want to say is that the first one is mine. I did touch on it before but when I was going through a by period in my business having to look at different income streams for staging so I created my packages and my style to stay service. So that was the first one and the second one and I think backup touched on this in her interview was that I had these staged a property and owner came back and said we had left scuffs all up and down the hall. We didn't and he never came back to me about it, but it was putting in a process of actually photographing the property before we even put Furniture into it so that we have evidence of anything that could go wrong afterwards.

I'm trying to feel good enough, but you know, like there's something a little bit off. I've made a lot of progress but I don't necessarily feel like I'm over it. I don't feel good enough and then we spent an hour working on this going back to my childhood going up and looking at my past conditioning and then but any of the conversations The last few words.

And again, you're just super grateful of a be there and you look around just like the best hip-hop and contemporary dancers and Jazz dancers old from all over the world and credible.

It's not so when they said well, what's how do you find motivation? I'm like, it's more that I really just enjoy this. I'm not like having to look. Outside of myself to find the motivation the motivation is actually within me because of the way it makes me feel right the consequences that come after it during it also like I don't look at it as like to go to the gym. I look at it as like this is my time to show up for me and knowing that it's probably benefiting my body like not even physically of how I look but like internally like my heart muscle, you know, like things like that. It's so much more than just. Oh, I'm doing 50 squats and losing weight in my butt looks better like what about Internal organs your you know, everything that you don't really think about when you're thinking of oh, I have to go to the gym absolutely.	-1.0

to be the last of his kind and this is seen and in the comic book known as Skull Island berth of column and mentioned by Hank Marlowe and remains of advantage of the deceased parents are called receipt of the skull crawlers territory of the movie and given that there are no dinosaurs in the movie and that the remains are President Scholars territory is possible that dinosaurs Old Scotland if they were once present there may have been wiped out by the skull crawlers or or something else that some unknown event prior to the film and During the production of the film The reason why there were no dinosaurs in the movie besides Triceratops skull was because it was because Jordan Valle de vocht Roberts thought that Jurassic world was still fresh in everyone's mind and praises and Praises Peter Jackson for for doing a decent job for making King Kong fight of earwax and in 2005 version, so he did it. So he tried to make up completely such make them look completely made-up creatures in the film, but the but the but the skull cause I got a pretty good crawling Bo It's like they reach their it's like they reach their arms around and they step they can also fall over pretty easily.

I'm scared for respawn because how much are there going to start trying to manipulate you spawn and like I was actually talking with Nate and just wasn't on air. I don't think but I was actually talking to Nate and I was like, you know, well like $18 for a skin that's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous.

So most people cannot and he was kind of average at the time. So I think if you look at these things even on an anecdotal basis and see what's what are the living conditions real terms. I would how did people live what did they consume? What kind of food they bring on the table? Where did they travel and so on in light of this? I mean clearly they are many signs of impoverishment and on top of this comes of course, I mean we have both right. I think we have Capital destruction. So there is an aggregate impoverishment at the same time. We have this redistribution. So they're out of the fewer resources in comparison to whatever 20 30 years ago. It's a greater chant goes to their people are very well connected and So the other classes and that is of course, that's that's explosive for society.	-1.0
I agree. I agree. I mean looking back at you know, my life just long so far, but when I look back in my life, you know, I know there's times when I wasn't the best person I could be you know, and any and those those moments, you know, if you know, you can't redo them, you know, there's times when I have been unkind I have either verbally been unkind or I've mentally been unkind and both of those things are you know things as humans, we you know, we got to deal with we got to recognize it but hopefully learn from it as well. And so, you know as we notice unkind things because it's going to happen in the classroom. We're Notice on kind things. Hopefully, that's the takeaway that students can can learn as yes, you know, this happened and and showing them how that's not the person they're going to want to grow up to be right. That's not the person and and when they can look at you you teachers out there and see that person who they're going to want to walk in your footsteps and hopefully that's the takeaway from today's episode.	1.0

So what's your I'm going to talk about cooking tips for people on their own what to buy and how the faith? Yeah. Yeah, we're not going to go alone. I like everyone else. I had a budget. I knew my total monthly net salary and I knew my expenses whatever I had left was for food entertainment in the inevitable birthday present. Yes. Yeah. I had my money in a credit union where every month they took out a certain amount and it was deposited into what I refer to as my rainy-day fund. Okay, when my yeah, it was a great thing on my car insurance bill came in once a year. It came out of the rainy day fund if I got a medical bill it came out of the rainy day fund saving it's important. Easy, but if you have a little stash of funds when something out of the ordinary occurs get a flat tire or something happens to your car, you know, whatever any little thing you have the money to cover it and it doesn't ruin your monthly budget. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great thing to have for Christmas presents to shopping. Say that again. Where did you go food shopping. I used to go to either the Stop and Shop or Star Market. Okay, the term Market isn't when I was I was living in Roslindale. Okay. Yeah, what's a good? Say that again. What's a good one a good cheat meal other than Ramen like a good meal. You know what when I was growing up I was growing up when I was living by myself, and I didn't want to cook but I happen to love. I love baked potatoes. Love them. That's what I go when I would do believe it or not. Open up the baked potato throw the mushrooms and peppers on top with a little bit of cheddar cheese. And it was delicious. I also used to do that.

Eh has always a good age. And so I was living in Beverly at the time and I was like sort of talking to this guy and like this is a common theme every girl in their life has a crush on a drug dealer. Every girl maybe not you Taylor. You're a good person. Everybody has a thing for one at least. Well, not are you talking like selling weed or selling? Oh, yeah just weed. Well Cody did that all throughout College. Sorry to put you on blast, but mommy we got to do that sometimes so kind of do like you can't always file your taxes with your true income.	1.0
Yeah, it's and I should clarify. It's AI think it's a great idea it like I've potentially interested in looking into some sort of version of an And Shop, whatever form that takes. I'm just always every time but I've kind of always thought about it or talked about it. We kind of went back and said I don't know if that even is something that would work. So I mean it's interesting to what's good to hear that for yourself in the area or in that it has been received well, and it's just maybe somebody out there needs to try it and maybe we'll keep watch with interest.	1.0
That's that's really nice. Yeah.	1.0

Yeah. I mean you said it before this impact. Every single thing they do for the rest of this winter and knocking it out now would be an advantageous because then you can start to set up what your team looks like without him. But if you hold on to him now and you start to make moves that is in anticipation of what a roster looks like with Francisco Lindor and then the trade comes you probably still make it but it's going to be a lot more difficult trying to make that audible on the Fly and then it becomes even more interesting as these trade talks unfold as you're sitting there and as a front office you think you're Maybe You're starting to make some progress and then the the other side of the table says yeah, we're sorta into it. But you know what we might need a guy like Mike Clevenger coming back.	1.0
He goes in the door closes and opens.	0.0
Yeah. I mean, I'm actually you kind of make me feel a little bit better about myself because I thought it was just me because literally this is how it happened it came out and I want to say I started the stream because I think it was what was it was either 11 or noon my time. And so I started the stream, of course my wife got off right around the same time, so I had to go get freaking groceries. But I only got uh game in I got a single game in I got two kills which you know for me was actually really cool. But I got I got both of the kills because of the jump at the first was in midair and then the other one was after I had landed so it felt really satisfying and I'm like sweet this is how I'm starting off the season then literally I go grocery shopping. I get home. I get some food for the kids, you know, like shut up go over there and he And then I start my stream again and just out like you said I just started getting slaughtered left and right it was to the point where like high morale was just so low and I'm just like, oh my God, I'm I'm trash I hate this and yeah, I mean like I feel a little bit better knowing that it's not just me that apparently was a lot of people because yeah, that was that was what happened with me. It was so yeah. Oh my God, I felt bad for a couple of reasons. I mean for one, obviously, I have a podcast where or like here's some tips and tricks and how to get kills and so to get slaughtered like that really really puts a damper on your mood. That's number one. But then number two is I'm trying to stream it. So like for anybody heard out there who doesn't know I'm a bus driver and this week happened to be this week happened to be spring break for the Boise school district or so. I'm like, okay, I don't have to go to work. This is awesome. I have a whole week division to Now they're dropping the battle pass. And so I was starting to try to get a little bit of a schedule for my twitch going. And so I started that but I'm doing horrible just absolutely terrible and it yeah, it felt horrible and I'm like the other side of the coin is the fact that it's like well, I'm trying to entertain people but it is so hard to entertain somebody when you're just not having a good time. I mean just losing one after another after another. I was just like okay, this is this deck dad's when I get it.	-1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Very good. Well, maybe I'll touch on that comment that the Big Dreams for the business at the end. But before I go into that something that's kind of related in a way to the retail side or the or the fact that there's almost this second business or what what I'm seeing in the industry from particularly from some of the staging businesses who have been in business for a little while and looking to add other revenue streams. I'm seeing little online stores pop-up not too common. But I've seen a few come up on the websites and and look it does make sense given that we do all this research when we're sourcing the Quality Furniture and we can often get better pricing through trade discounts or wholesale pricing. So I understand it and I think you've kind of done this in a clever way. Not only that you've got the That we just talked about but you also have done I guess it kind of an online just store but you've specifically called them bedroom packages and you've set up it this online store to sell what is essentially Furniture but in a bedroom package and I haven't seen that done quite the same anywhere else. So I you know, I'm really interested in the thought process behind or you know, how you came about deciding to do something like this or testing it out and kind of how you found it.	1.0
It really does and everyone's days and I'll be so fucking pissed and you won't like it you already think I'm too fucking grumpy is the word they use for Dad hates his life. You're always so grumpy. That's their euphemism. Yeah. Well that's perpetuated by you.	-1.0

That's where a lot of the circular thinking and rumination comes from so sometimes I just let it out and it just makes it a lot. Better but yeah, so what I had to sort of assume like the first baby step I took in this entire Enterprise of like human decency and I city is that I just like pretended as if people cared about my response like I used to be the king of being like, oh, you know just fine Kelly and you know, whatever like tired or like.	1.0

Mine was putting a belt over my clothes and I always and I always thought Not that this came from Alex from Wizards of Waverly Place.

And then I remember it exactly how messy that was what it was because I remember the interview because I had a scheduled like webcam interview with two of the people. All that were in charge of that and they just like ask me a bunch of questions. So they've asked me like who's your favorite character? When did you start watching the show? What is your favorite thing about the show and literally my favorite character was Styles. I started watching the show when it first started airing like the very first episode I tuned in and I told them like my favorite part of the show is steric and they were like, why is that, you know, your favorite part of the show and I explain to them why I liked the two characters together and like Part of what shipping was like I gave them kind of like a like Outsider kind of information. So I didn't go into like depth as to what it was and they seem fine with it. Like they didn't seem like shocked they're like hesitant and then of you went fine, and then I guess I got handed down to the other people who were like no, but they did have a steric on they had it right when they changed president's yeah. They had a guy. Who was supposed to be doing like a game like a video game? Yes, and I never happen. I wonder why they probably got shut down or something and they were like you can't make this even though it was going to be like out of his own time and again nothing to do but the show but that game never came out. But I remember he had like video footage of like the first like be getting up. Game, yeah and looked fine. Like I was excited for it, but it never came out.	1.0

That's really cool with sell these DVDs out of the back of my car van ten bucks a pop. I walked away one time with $200. I knew at that point you could make money from this. I knew at that point. I was like, you know, you don't have to take that easy route you can An actually do something for yourself and I think that's why I'm always in the freelance mindset.

I think that's an interesting story and then like you touching on like people are really interested in any biopics. I think you know for every for every like good when we do have some bad ones, but I mean, I think when I think of like the good ones, I think like the Bobbi Brown one that was pretty good. The new edition was probably the best one. It was a few more and they are you you have then you have the ones like Alia and the other stuff like that. So it's like it was a couple of the bad ones. I don't want to harp on them. But it's I like I like watching those because you get to see you even when you think you know everything about the artist or something like that that that's public knowledge those little those little tidbits to come in and he's like damn I ain't realized that like, will you watch the Bobby Brown stuff?

Not maybe like in the near future, but in the future future, I'm feeling like maybe like Netflix and Verizon team up like and collaborate that I don't I don't I would not want to eat like a cable company teaming up with us big streaming service, you know what I mean? Because like cables already pretty big they make a lot of money off phones and stuff their phones for different thing.

Well, it marked the end of the band Pink Floyd incredibly contemporary. It sounds just as good now as what it did back then wish you were here the 9th album from Pink Floyd according to Roger Waters Mark the end of the band. However, another one was to come of course namely the wall a beautiful Masterpiece as well. But on this occasion, it's wish you were here and there's a good reason for it. This particular album was when Roger Waters set himself up to be solely the bandleader dismissing a lot of Dave Gilmore's incursions Nick Mason's as well as Richard Wright. It was at the time a real Roger Waters trademark, and that's what Pink Floyd was fast becoming Dave Gilmore's vocals on wish you were here. I think arguably sizes up the salty sweet. Nation of what was the relationship between waters and Gilmour the way that he sung it there's a debate whether or not wish you were here is actually one of the highest performing songs by buskers and artists alike a favorite performed on acoustic guitar. If you go to any Pub on a Sunday afternoon, it's likely that you hear the song performed some better than others. How could a slow song such as wish you were here? How could Contemporary ballad if you like become such a pillar of the face of rock and roll well meaning the whole meaning not just the way it's written what was written but how it was performed how it was sung. There's a distinctive note a pairing and it certainly comes across on this album. And on the track when Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd was released. It went straight to the top of the It's on both sides of the Atlantic. It's sold over 14 million copies just within 12 months. I mean this was going to be a smash no matter what the album itself has. The cover has a man in flames and the other one shaking his hand as you know back then it was actually done. He actually lit himself on fire and shook the guy's hand and then they had to extinguish him. But get this they couldn't do it. Just once they had to do it a few times to get the the right shot. It's just something that was needed at the time. And this was Artistry going in a New Direction actual photographs of people doing this kind of thing. It was a Telltale sign of the stories to follow especially with the wall. That was forthcoming Richard Wright of Pink Floyd later said that this was without a doubt his favorite album. Actually. It's a lot of people's favorite album for many reasons the songs on it are immeasurable just beautiful tracks back to back so So enjoy it if you haven't heard it and if you do have it just pick up that volume turned up to ten on a Saturday night, you know do what you need to do to feel the way that you do and enjoy one of the finest albums and one of the world's best rock albums ever met. Well, that's it for today's show was almost perfect. Wasn't it? You know bearing the 30 or 40 remarkably obvious mistakes.	1.0

What do you typically do but they might think that you should go through that. My thing is just showing patience, you know, Transformations don't happen overnight and I think for me, it's just trying to challenge them in their weak areas and just keep them accountable drink more water. Like a lot of people don't drink enough water dude for females out there track your water intake at least 90 fluid ounces of water or two-thirds of your body weight and for males you want at least a hundred twenty fluid ounces or two-thirds of your body weight. So a lot of people when they train and I asked how much water they have. They're hella tired in the beginning and I asked how much water in there like I haven't had any water. I just had my coffee right and then if you're if you're sleeping for six to eight hours, you're not having any water then we wake up you go pee you have coffee you have you haven't had water for 10 12 hours possibly and then you try to work out and do cardio and less weights your guests 70% of your muscle is water that you need water. So that's number one. One two, I'll try to help them. Tell them to get a little more rest if they can because that's a big thing. But you know, if they slip I think it from me. I've learned that it's better just to keep showing positive encouragement instead of trying to tear them down. You know, it's kind of like parenting and you don't want to tear people down.	1.0

For me, the the unit of account of function is the derived one. So you have these three function that you find the text books rather three main functions are sort of value unit of account and medium of exchange. Okay, and the essential function of one is to serve as a medium of exchange so much that that's my point of view. Right? So we have this is the essence of money to are generally used medium of exchange but with that but without coercion Well, I mean the whole stew even for those monies that are being imposed right in one way or another right? So it's the generally used medium of exchange and then as a consequence you calculate in terms of that money unless they're very strong inflation or something like this, right then you need to calculate other different places, but the foundations, of course indeed to serve as a store of value and here indeed we have problems with Bitcoin because Bitcoin only serves as we evolve. Exchange or is a store of value for services right now. It's a speculative object and so on but it has no other function whereas precious metals have multiple. Alternative uses not only in jewelry. But yeah, very numerous industrial uses because of the particular very special physical characteristics of these Metals. So that means that in the case of all it's only always have a fallback position and there's always an additional demand industrial demand or non-monetary demand that serves as a buffer to salvage the these Metals if ever the monitor uses put into question. So on bitcoin is much more fragile about that because it has no natural non-monetary use. So I think Bitcoins have come into circulation and can be kept there thanks to the ideological now and not in the negative sense right would just say libertarian talking exactly. Do you need to have people as the commitment who are ready to absorb the losses that come with a fall in the value of Bitcoins some if everybody just cells Because the price is going down. Well Bitcoins will be driven completely out of the market. So for this not to help you need to have people who are committed to bitcoin. So you don't consider it merely as a monitor your financial instrument now in the case of gold and silver you don't need this you because gold and silver have always other users and people who are active in jewelry or who use: silver cellphones or Aerospace. And however, they will be happy if prices go down and so you don't need that sort of emotional intellectual commitment to this. So therefore they are more robust Bitcoins.	1.0

So after we were going to go on to our next topic after their hetero parade and Go funny stories funny stop Thomas you want to talk about that Mouse thing because you know get a little bit of curious. Okay. So this is actually something that I just thought everyone should know if you haven't been keeping up with like science part of the news because I don't think that's I don't know if it's right up under shown on or anything like real news yet, but scientists have been working with a with a gene editing tool called. Crispr has nine and you can edit things and fix things and they were able to make they're able to do things and like they were able to basically cure HIV in most mice that had it because you know, they they got mice that had HIV and erotic. Okay. Now we're going to try to get basically get rid of so they use crisper and they're able to get rid of HIV so their plan now is to try it out on humans and see if that works and I mean I mean, that's one of the biggest steps.	1.0

We took these floaties to this part instead of like a bow instead of anything. We took like this like a little legit like blow up floaty and paddled our way and the floaty was deflating in the middle of the lake at like freaking 12 a.m. And I had a panic attack and like cried and almost drowned and but we made it.	-1.0
Yeah again, I had a good thing about this one and I always just kept coming back to branding and I think this comes back to my corporate days where Brandon is so important the corporate company that I made sure that my brand was Sit up and it was consistent from the get-go.

In their natural everyday life totally like how off you know, it's so normalized like how often do you hear people say I need to burn this off or I need to like work out so that I can go to brunch even here in like Fitness classes. A lot of Fitness instructors will use terms like, you know burn it to earn it and it's just like do you say something L. I actually do because I obviously am very strongly opinionated about this and it's really harmful because not everybody is there to like learn Our food and why can't we just enjoy moving our bodies without feeling like we need to compensate for food? It's like I don't ever have to think about needing to compensate so that I can take a breath or like use oxygen which is another just physiological need but why is there all of this language around food as if it's something we need to earn when it's like your body just requires food and you don't need to earn or compensate for your food and anyway, and that mentality is what's so damaging not even really the the food itself. I'm I love this.	-1.0
You know, you're in great shape or I want to be like you right? I don't I truly don't believe that I would be in the shape. I am now if it wasn't for my environment, right like you are what your environment is if I hang out with a whole bunch of depressed people most likely I'm going to be depressed if I hang around with people that are usually up like really positive most likely I'll be positive if I'm hanging around people that all Count Their macros and go to the gym six times a week most likely I'll be fit right etcetera. So I am kind of humbled. I'm occupation, but the same time if I worked at nine to five or ten to six whatever it's either I got to wake up really early in the morning and be tired and work out or go to the gym after work where I'm tired and work out. So I understand like how hard it must be for people to have consistency. Like you have to make it a daily plan where you're going to go designate this time and just execute and stick with it. Right and accountabilities huge. You know, that's why I said It's important to have somebody that could keep you in check. Whether is your best friend your brother or your spouse or a trainer a coach whatever but honestly with those people I completely understand. I think the goal is really just to find a balance in your life. Like it's not everybody's goal to be in the next bikini competitions not everybody's goal to be the next powerlifter. It's not everybody's goal to run a mile in, you know, five minutes six minutes. I think just follow what makes you happy with his Jiu-Jitsu that you love if it's basketball. All that you love if it's yoga that you love just continue to do that and you know be mindful of your nutrition. I think for me what's really worked is intermittent fasting is give me it gives me a block where I could eat at a particular time also count my calories and I think that gives me flexibility with feeding Cravings think counting calories is a huge skill that a lot of people don't consistently do and I'm a big advocate of that because that really changed my life ever since we watched The Hodgetwins that's how I learned counting calories. Calories in versus calories out. These guys are eating chicken the chicken nuggets. They're eating pizza. They're having Taco Bell and they're still looking good and I was like, I was confused. What do we eat for dinner? Like I was under the conventional thought that you have to eat brown rice chicken and broccoli meal prep your food in order for you to be fit. But you don't yeah, you don't like you. All you have to do is track your calories do a little bit of cardio hit a little bit of resistance just baby steps like when my favorite quotes is by Bruce Lee and he says I do not fear the man. The kick is 10,000 times. I fear the man the kicks once a day for ten thousand days. So at the end of the day, it's not about short-term intensity. It's about consistency. Right just it's it's the accumulation of the little things that matter right? It's habits is where we're creatures of habit. So I think that's about anything in life. If you want to be successful in anything. It's really just about consistency. That's it.	1.0
So we knew three days before. So again, we come in like we're setting up for the meet and greet Bashas like iron shirt were obviously turning on the office and funny enough. It was on live TV, so that was great. So watching the office and I'm like crap, you know, I have to go to this meet and greet right now, and I just really To finish this episode. It was like so good. I think it's the one when Jim proposes to Pam or something like that and I'm like, oh my God, this is the best like so good. Just want to watch it and we're like, okay, whatever. We'll just we'll go on Netflix later and like finish watching the episode. I'm like, okay, so we go to the meet and greet. And Sasha Farber turned around to me and he's like, oh my God Meredith is here. I'm like, what? Wait, who's Meredith? Yeah. Wait. What do you mean? He's like Danny Meredith is here.

This 250 I want to raise a much larger round relatively speaking and really go and really own this market Sterling is wanting to raise the 250 now to help them get to profitability with the plan of raising a much larger round in 2018. Sterling has made his pitch now it's decision time. Here's Daniel is how I feel which is I I'm a huge believer in Sterling Smith the founder. I think you're super Scrappy. I think you've pulled together a team on not that much money and you've frankly built a product that I think at least looks great relative to the other, you know, many quasi competitors or similar products that I've seen in the market my my I'm going to hold off on committing here because my biggest question is Good size. So I don't yet know how big if you get 50% market share or 20 percent market share of your target retailers. And I think all businesses need to start somewhere. I get the we're going after Nan retailers and I get that, you know story but I think you're going to have to nail your target sort of mid-market retail segment. First So my answer is I think it's really interesting. Would love to connect with you after the fact on Market size. Excellent. That's Amelia actually there. Really good segue to my control, which is I want to invest in a company where I can pour fuel on the fire where you have a scalable way of acquiring customers and I can add money to it that will let you explode that that's not here yet. Plus I'm afraid you're not raising enough money. You're going to go back and raise again, very soon. Your focus is going to have to be on fundraising and not on sales and marketing. I appreciate that and and that that's a distraction to me. That's a distraction. I'm concerned about for you.	-1.0

And so you're joining us from Brisbane. Is that correct?	0.0
No, but I know I've said no to things in the past and they've done them. But at this point the thought of running around a little track for that long. Yeah, how about you? What I do. Yeah, the answer is I probably would ya he said what actually gets interesting. That's for sure. But yes, the truth is I would I would have a bash of that. Yeah, I think that would be oh, I think that would be a lot of men. To anguish in there for fun.	1.0
Yeah, I think she actually killed the brunette and then accordingly we Gucci Mane. I think that's my there's definitely my favorite out of all of the songs on here. I just think that be was dull but I like all the production my homies are trying to argue with me and he was like man, he's like just sound like some simple shit he over here talking about his kids and talking about, you know, I'm sorry cardi B every song by Mike. What else are you supposed to do? Like, this is what he's been going through for a whole year. Bam, like I would rather him talk about what's going on his life then fake it and act like nothing happened because we clearly know this something happened. So this is what you do when you grow and you make songs and you make projects about your life. Like you have to grow you have to evolve like obviously he still talking about like the same old shit, like like getting money and mess with women is stuff which I still find it funny because they're like was like, we know what's going on with your life. But you know, you still gotta for the people that I get. Guess halfway don't listen or don't care. You still gotta keep up that Persona in a sense, but was still even with that like he still had some like some like really really touching and personal songs. Like don't lose me. That was a that was a very personal song Father for the very first songs on here and then came a long way that was probably like his one of the most personal songs those three right there. But but overall like I like the production I thought that you know for the majority it was upbeat. I was messing with it compared to the other two Migos projects and I think their overall like like in this is just comparing all the D'Amico's like he had the best like it was it was just no question. He definitely had the best albumin and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of songs on here and I've been listening to it ever since it came out. So so that's my take on it. How you feel about this like	1.0

Sure, rough bro. It's the music. That's the that's the way it goes man. That's why it's like it's like now it's so much easier because most people can just go independent. But you know, then it was like, you know, you'll dream was to be on a major and get your music played on the radio and stuff like that like a lot of artists that going through that now like the product of the you know, I won't say pre internet but before the internet took control of the music, No, so that's just as is what it is man, they'd assign a lot of bullshit deals and paying for it right now to this day.	-1.0

I would do 6040 60/40 I think 60% diet 40% workout. I think you know you do have to work hard to to get like you can't just you know, it's a good combination of both. I just say I would put 60/40 because I feel like a lot of people when it's January 1st. The very first question that they asked for that the devil's tell themselves is I got to go to the gym. They're not they're not thinking I gotta save calories or I gotta watch my eat my food just like I gotta go too. Like a lot of times when people are broke their like I got to find more ways to make money right now. You have to find ways to decrease your expenses. I focus on what you can control first, right? And so it's just really about detaching yourself keeping track. You know, I think having the ability what one of my mentors told me what doesn't get measured does not get improved. You have to have some type of Quantified measurement so that way okay. It's a Earth to see this time, how can I get a B next time How can I get a right? So for people track a calories while your food out for not waiting some of your food out in your kind of just estimating that can only take you so far but honestly once you get in the habit of doing so keep things simple prep your meals I just have a whole bunch of foods, you know ready in the fridge. That way you don't have to eat things that you know overload on things that are healthy for you now and you can still have a good time like you don't have to, you know, go be all in. Have to be too extreme like find a balance, you know, enjoy your life suposed to be a speed round.	1.0
Yeah, it's so funny reading some of the comments on my YouTube channel because they're all like saying that I'm running around is like an atheist circle now and it's the actually like complete opposite of that. Like I still have all of my same friends from Junior High and high school and they are like all Christians and I'm kind of the only one that left. left which is kind of what has been so hard about this whole journey is just being like, you know the odd one out and it's just interesting to see like how his like I totally understand like not all Christians at the same and people are like don't just let like a few bad apples like ruin your experience, but I'm like guys like I love my friends like I know that they're not like bad people but I'm just sit like my whole thing is that sometimes the things that they Believe and do and say because of that can be hurtful and I don't think people realize that you know, and I've just like experienced a lot of that with my very conservative Evangelical fundamentalist fundamentalist friends.	1.0

I probably would have started tracking my inventory from Okay, I started buying so much furniture and accessories that at the time I think it was you just get so carried away in how busy your business is and you know, you're trying to fill the many hats that you need to are in a small business that I just left. I didn't do an inventory list, so it wasn't until last year. I think it was where I actually started getting serious about documenting everything that right. At home staging had acquired over the four years to make my life easier because when you're standing in your shares and you need you know, 12 Euro pillows and three sets of bedside lamps and you've got no idea if you have those available or not. It's really hard.	-1.0
They that it could only be used for very large scale transactions. I mean starting with the men's suit may be okay, but then buying things like Vehicles buildings That's also a rather large objects. It is never been really a medium of exchange and daily transactions daily transaction was always silver or some alloy of silver or some or bronze or something like this or this storm. Okay, and that's actually a good thing. It's good that people actually own personally control. The money of the country lutely for mises is we talked about the ocean school before and these economies that I admire most is the end of his career. It was precisely this consideration that you stressed a lot. I said, well, you know sound monetary system. It's the people themselves each all individual Market participants who personally control a part of the money supply and so they only had the money in their pockets or at home and so on. So that's truly Democratic populist control of this crucial social institutions and silver allows that if you impose gold on On the economy and that is exactly what has happened in the last quarter of the 19th century. Like when silver was demonetized was a political movement top down movement and gold was imposed as a money on the the economy. Then you automatically get a shot in the arm of thinking because you cannot use Golden daily transactions that it's you need to have some money substitutes that can take the place of gold but in smaller denominations in Daily exchanges So that's why banking has become so strong and has developed. So strongly in the last Decades of the 19th century. Then of course all through the 20th century now, let me close this in and get to the gold treasure gold. So I start thinking about gold as a monetary instrument, but I've come to the conclusion that God is actually very important in a free society and a free economy as a store. value is eat as a natural way of saving for especially for people who don't know the first thing about financial markets and financial techniques that risk management and what have you very straightforward and simple way to save some of your Revenue to put some money aside for your old age and so on it's just too to stock gold coins and that's what people have been doing for many centuries and I think the reason why central banks are so adamant in controlling the gold price and preventing that the gold price in a foreseeable way it goes up which would happen in an actual free market is that precisely goal is the main competitor not necessarily as money for Fiat money, but it's the natural. For financial markets.	1.0

I don't even like the video it was dumb. It was video called why I left Christianity and it was actually a response video to a different video that I had made where I had said like, you know, I was silenced in church and like I wasn't allowed Odd to ask questions and like all this stuff and people were like, you know commenting on that and so I did a response video basically clarifying saying I was allowed to ask questions, but I could only ask them once and then once I asked them and got the Christian answer it was like that's your answer like accept it and if it wasn't good enough for me. It was like why are you like beating a dead horse? Why are you still so like, you know, you're just trying to like, you know, put your Deceitful Wicked heart into scripture because you want you know it to be the way you want it to be in like all this stuff and it was just such a misinterpretation of me. Just trying to like learn more and do research and it was like if you keep talking like that you're going to talk yourself right out of this face like you don't sound like a Christian to me and it was just kind of a lot of kind of it wasn't even a very accurate title now that I'm thinking about it because I truly clarified and said I left because I didn't think If the facts were there but in the midst of me doing all this research and and kind of getting all these questions brought to the surface. I was a bit frustrated that I was like borderline not even a Christian at this point and yet you know people I knew who wanted to go into Ministry who were dedicating their life to this Faith didn't even care enough to know the deeper side of their belief system. Like they just had no interest in looking deeper and study. Harder in in answering my questions and like I understood that everyone has their own life and you know, they can't just put it on pause to then, you know study all this stuff with me, but it did frustrate me that the church in itself did a poor job of preparing Christians for the tough questions. Like if there's an atheist who knows apologetics better than Christians, that's that's not good. Good, you know I don't know I feel like that video was like misinterpreted through the YouTube space is crazy.	-1.0
No, I agree. I had as much as I like do the young receivers like slate and Boykin and even Wesley little bit the Packers young receivers. I want to see what they can do this year. And we've already taken Debo Samuel off the board. So I think another you offensive lines the way to go. They do need to fortify it. McGovern's he's going to be a steady player. I think he's going to be a solid player for a long time. And I think that you'd and plus drafting a pure interior offensive linemen will help because years past we've always have two tackles and shifted him in. I think drafting a guy who's been a guard before gives him a little bit of that extra Edge when they come into camp and let you learn the intricacies right away. And so yeah, let's make Connor McGovern The Pick and so just a few more pics is till we get to our gift from the Washington Redskins at pick 118 and there goes miles Boykin right off the bat. So the three picks between McGovern and the current one Justin Hollins from Oregon goes to the Panthers miles Boykin to the Dolphins again because they take everyone that we want and Joe. Jackson of Miami goes to the Falcons So now top guys on the board Josh all over still out there from San Jose State. Jajuan Johnson from Miami Darius. Slaton Antoine Wesley. Treyvion Williams, Jacoby Myers Dennis daily Marquis Blair from Utah Ronnie Anderson from Oklahoma and Demarcus Lodge from Mississippi are the top guys on the board will further down the Border guys, like will Grier Terry Godwin Titus Howard Jared Stidham still on the board a little bit further down house Gaskins still down there as well, but There's still some good names out. There is still some good prospects for pick 118.	1.0

Very much is not child that authors hear me. I think it can work for a long time depends on the conditions also depends on how people act what what people will do it can act because we have very smart managers at the top of central banks who know the business, you know, what they can do if they cannot do we have generation of politicians who have enough equal. Reconstruction so that they know where they cannot exaggerate it with helping themselves through the printing press. All right, so there's some minimal discipline there. That's and they want to use really the printing press right now to be in Revenue. We're not at that point. Once you're at that point, then you're close to hyperinflation of closer columns, right? There was for example the situation in Germany after World War one and when they had huge public debt deficits for five years in a row, I mean Really huge and eventually, they just need the printing press to get the revenue because the taxes were no longer sufficient. Now even though President Trump has made some very considerable efforts in that direction of the huge deficit in the US as well. But nowhere near the situation which they would truly do need the printing press right right now they can help sell some of the current market. So as long as these conditions Prevail, I don't think we're anywhere near So drun finish stop stop of the this can last for a longer time, but he can't last indefinitely. Yeah, definitely.	-1.0

Yeah what that is almost sickening but like at least it's better than people not being aware and buying into Something that they don't understand it's kind of cool that if you'd like people are I remember like when he's first started it like watching YouTube your favorite YouTubers couldn't have a fucking sponsor without everyone calling them fucking sellouts or Yeah by trying to dissuade them.

And if someone's meant to encounter God in a specific way that will be taken care of with or without you harping on the person and actually it's probably less likely to happen if you are harping on the person so just like it's like they could go and they could be showing so much of like, what is it like what day want to like show the person of like if they say that they have God inside of them. It's like are they really showing that because right, you know, a lot of the Christians, you know, people want nothing to do with them because they're so mean and so it's like why would we want your God if like this is what he looks like in my core. I think I fundamentally think we as Humanity are intrinsically good and and I know that like a lot of Christian teaching is that like we're intrinsically evil, but I guess I was just kind of encourage people to step away from I'm like necessarily putting that on all of humanity. Like I don't know. I'm just so positive and I'm so optimistic and like I know there are so many bad things in this world, but I feel like they're always met with like an overwhelming amount of love and support that shows like the goodness of humanity. Like for example, the Orlando nightclub shooting that happened, you know, that was like horrible, but after that Like there were so many people lined up to donate blood and I think just like recognizing that that we are like capable of doing so much good and and focusing on that and then also recognizing that people are so much more than a label like there's so much more than a single word or a single defining term and if we can accept people and like truly accept them. For who they are and not try to change them. I think will realize that it's okay to disagree because those labels don't Define who a person is like I don't Define you by your Christian faith, like you're someone who is fighting for Change and promoting love and acceptance and kindness and equality and those are things that I agree with so if we can focus on what we have in common instead of what divides us, I think, you know, we can you know, Live in a much better world just recognize that the people like your enough like your enough just being you. I don't know like I just feel like like it's in us like we're just good. Well, thank you so much for this conversation. It was awesome.	1.0
So I like I had started right at home staging in. And just as I'd move back to be you this home where Shop opened up and it was amazing. I would go there and buy pieces for staging and then 12 months later or less the owner put it up for sale and my cousin just off the cuff said maybe we should buy it. That's what we did. We went in and we bought this home where shop and it actually is a real blessing in disguise for right at home staging because I can access A lot of products through the shop and also they kind of a good advertising for either side of the business. So if I use some art in runner home staging, you know, you can buy through the Hub so good cross promotion and it's a it's another creative outlet for me when I'm not staging so I really love it.	1.0

I love it. I love this. I really do. We've had a few questions from people and a lot of the weird random diems have to do with us and like the most absolutely hammered we've ever been It seems like we give the impression that we're drinking which we are we do. We do give that impression and I just want to say that yes, we enjoyed a drink but like we don't we don't do that every day, and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. No, it's we're working on it. We're working on our no so as we're drinking wine, so no, so basically a lot of them had to do. With stories of us and like the most Hammer we've been together and we were thinking and I said to myself. Well, I mean the most hammered I've ever been just hasn't been with her. Yeah. We kind of came to that conclusion that like we have been very much hammered together college high school, but God well no together. No, I know but you mean other than like being together. I like we're going to tell some stories and one of my stories of the most drunk. I've ever been has been in high school. I started early start him young start him young I really did. Like I had like a lot of things in high school, which mine was in college mines mines pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to start? I'll start. All right. Okay our love. Okay. So this was when I was 20 years old, so I wasn't 21 yet and I feel like when I turn 21 Unlike just a side note like I tamed down a little bit. That's not like as like yeah. Yeah, you're 21 like drinking song is fun anymore. Yeah, like don't get me wrong. There was no thrill. I mean there was a thrill they're still a threat or so, but this was back when it was like Wild and Woolly. Okay, so I was 20 and it was about three months before I was going to be 21 years old. So a bunch of my friends at that time. We're turning 21. It was junior year. Everybody was like had that calendar out, you know what I mean when like they were had like the 21 countdown. Oh, yeah, three months two months one month. So my friend had a birthday in January and she decided to hold it at this club called story bill and it's in Boston and it's it used to be super fun. I don't really know what it's like now, but I said to myself I'm going to go and it's going to be awesome and we're gonna we're gonna get in there and I had a fake ID at the time and it was a Real a real fake ID if that makes any sense. It was a real human being I had a girl from Suffolk who just like totally hooked me up like she had dark hair and blue eyes and just like she just let me have it. I gave her 50 bucks to get a new license and she just she was awesome. She was the MVP. So I had I had an ID and at the time I was eating a guy who was older so he was over 21 and I said, you know, we I really want to go to this. I want to celebrate her birthday. 'The day he said sure the day of the birth day comes I was I remember I like legitimately like of course went Forever 21 and like found a sexy jumpsuit with like a super crazy v-neck in it and I was like, I'm hungry.

Okay? Okay. I'm going to piggyback off you. I'm not going to name the same people twice, but as everybody knows who listen to this podcast and just you know mess with Over the years for rails my absolute favorite producer of all time, but I want to add some more people jazze PHA. I think I didn't jazze PHA definitely made definitely made a lot of Jazzy Fizzles production zaytoven, even though even though I kind of criticized him a lot of times because for the longest he did not make like different sound he beats he loved using those freaking Jamaican drums and it he will not do anything else, but they Toven, he literally like me Gucci Mane's career. I'm not even gonna lie, like he may go to man's career because those be they made for him like and all those freaking mixtapes albums that he put out. They told him made that sound fam. So like they told me I had to get his respect for the new wage trap sound in ATL like without a doubt that man is freaking amazing.

It was easy to maintain and it reinforced the type of play. I wanted when someone would make a great play. There would usually be one or two girls yelling heart sticker. It was perfect fast forward to The Following season a few of the same girls are on my team and I'm excited to use stickers as bribery for good play yet again. I announce this to the team at our first meeting expecting the same excitement and enthusiasm which existed with my previous team. However, this group of girls was older and quite frankly not even mildly enthused about stickers Gotta Love high schoolers. I was a little taken aback. By their sideways glances and raised eyebrows, but just knew that once we started playing and they started earning their stickers. They would love it. This was never the case try as I might the stickers never stuck. I tried and tried but it eventually proved to be more of a distraction than a source of unity halfway through the season. I admitted defeat and ditched the stickers. If anything that experience taught me that I cannot force traditions on to a team, especially when they develop organically from a teammate. Up of completely different individuals. So when you are trying to create reinforcements of your preferred behaviors just be aware that some may not work as you planned and be okay with abandoning your efforts when you're positive. They won't catch on or work for your team. Try things out that worked for you when you played But realize that your team might not be as excited as you are just because something doesn't catch on initially doesn't mean it won't work. I enjoy mixing up teams and warm up Partners, but telling the girls to pick a new partner literally never works. And someone is always complaining it's horrible.

He's gonna write their players were shot in his own rights on him to go right but I was calling my name is on make it and I went I stuck to my plan and I made it. How did it feel after you made it good? That's like the best feeling. Yeah. Yeah. All right guys. Well, thanks for coming on and hope you have a good offseason and be ready to back go back again next year. Oh right on the volleyball side of things what a season for the girls coming into the year. The focus really was on everyone that graduated the girls return just two players from last year. And the question was could the young players on this team play well enough to compete at the varsity level. There was obviously some talent but what it translate to Varsity the first year and the answer ended up being a very definitive. Yes, the girls went 12 and 2 and won their first dvcac championship since 2004 15 years ago. Oh, that's a long time and this wasn't like soccer because the boys had been there the last several years and they were kind of expected to be back in the championship for the girls. This was kind of Uncharted Territory. And as I was standing there watching the consolation game before the championship the girls looked like they were locked in and ready now hindsight is always 20/20, but they looked like a team that was ready to go win a championship and it showed right from the start of the game. They just look like they were much more prepared to play in a game of this magnitude than their opponent was they won. The first game 25:21 and pretty much Controlled it the whole way. It just never felt like Chestertown could get any momentum going in that first set. And the thing is we made a lot of serving errors. I'm not sure the exact number in the first set but we made 13 serving errors overall. That's a lot. So if you take away those serving errors, this was a complete domination in the first little bit of the game. That was the only way Chestertown with scoring. We were doing everything else better than them. And after that first win the girls came out with a lot of energy momentum and were dominating the second set. I think it was like 16 to 7 when Chester town called a timeout and coming out of the timeout they were able to regroup and start to play their game a little bit. They came all the way back and we're within 24 23 and they were serving the ball and they served it out of bounds and gifted us that last point for a 25-23 win. And now it was to nothing the last set started off poorly for GMS Chestertown. Got an early lead in maintain that for a long time. It felt like our girls maybe it just taking their foot off the gas a little bit. They just weren't as crisp with their And their hits as they had been in the first two sets, but they got a timeout refocused eventually took their first lead at 17 16 and then didn't look back with a score of 2421 Chester town called their final timeout, but it didn't help Amber Humphries served up an ace For the Win. It was a very exciting moment for the girls as they celebrated their well-deserved Championship. So really the question for this season was how do you go from losing almost your entire team the year before including two All-Stars and one all-conference player and Glee start brand new in win a championship with that team and I think a big part of that is good coaching the coaches recognize where their strengths and weaknesses were and put girls in positions where they could use those strengths and not have to do things. They couldn't do and coaching is great. But ultimately it comes down to the players on the court and you had two freshmen coming this year who were very good hitters and Amber and Kailyn and so you wanted to get them hitting as much as you can and in order for them to be able to hit you need good sets and Riley will pretty much give you a good set every single time even if she The bad path she's going to set her hitters up with a quality opportunity for a kill the strategy is if you can get Riley setting the Amber and killing as much as possible. You're going to be in good shape. Not a lot of teams in our league have three players as good as those three and it showed in the championship game and then aside from those three, you want your other three players on the court to be able to minimize mistakes and make the easy plays you want them to be able to dig when needed give Riley a good pass for a set. You want them to build a serve well and not make a lot of serving errors and I think they did that between Amanda Renee. Elsie and Emily you got solid role players that allowed the team to succeed they knew their jobs and they performed them well, and I think this team really showed what good teamwork can do for the success of a team in any sport not everyone's going to play the same role on the team. Some players are going to get more action more hits more shots, whatever it may be and the players need to recognize their role and buy into it for a team to be successful and the girls did that a lot of that's on the coaches to put them in those roles and make sure the players clearly understand their roles and in my opinion, that's Made this team great and weren't that tall? In fact, there are high school volleyball team. They would be probably considered short. So when you watch them play, it's not like a jump out at you right away, but they just worked really well together and understood their roles and brought home a banner to hang in the gym and the future looks very bright for GMS volleyball Riley's just a sophomore Kailyn and Amber are freshmen Emily and Kelsey are freshmen you lose to girls abandon Renee and you'll need to replace them. They played well, but there are some quality players coming up for the Middle School ranks next year and I think you're looking potentially at another really good year and I think I think they should be the favorites in the league heading into next season a few Awards to recognize here for volleyball Kaelyn Amber Riley and Amanda were all chosen to play in the dvcac All-Star Game. Amber was second in the league in Aces with 43 and forth in kills with 82 Riley led the league in assist with 172 and she led an Aces as well with 45 and second place for us. This was 78 so that each shows what a wide margin. She led a sister. She had a hundred seventy two second was 78 Kelsey was 19th. And Aces with 12. Amanda was ninth in Aces with 18 and Calum was first in kills with 125 forth in Aces with 31 and seventh in blocks with seven. There was a little bit of controversy with the volleyball All Conference team when the teams were first announced that the All-Star Game a couple of weeks ago. Kalyn was named all-conference and she was the only one from GMS to be named all-conference. They chose six players that night to be recognized as all-conference members now, they got it wrong. There was some miscommunication there there should have actually been eight players selected for that team. And so what happened is the His went back and re voted for two more players to be added to the all-conference team. And when they did that both Amber and Riley were selected. And so we ended up with three All Conference members Kalin Amber and Riley. I do think it's kind of absurd that Riley especially was not named all-conference originally in the top six. I think if you look at both the stats that she put up and just watch her play. You would know that. That she definitely is one of the six best players in the league and maybe could make the case that she's the most important player in the entire league. If you look at again her assist numbers 172 assist compared to second place with 78. She led the league in Aces as well. I think that she should have been on that top 6, but regardless they got it, right eventually her and Amber were also named to the all-conference team. So congratulations to those three. Kaelan, Riley and Amber. All right. I'm joined Now by Renee and Amanda. Hi, so you guys did not play volleyball last year. You decided to play this year for your senior year all in all. Are you glad you played?	0.0
Well, I was going to ask if I mean the back free I think that was one of the first times really we saw Cody then Duncan say sort of look pretty pretty solid. I know we've had previous games. We've spoke about it the Arsenal game and so on but forward touch on it now before we move on to the next game, how do you lot think that I know they didn't play that back for you today? But how do you lot think we've adjusted? Life without Willie Bali as well because I personally think it's doing a lot better than what I am.	1.0
Yeah, so, I mean that's how a name gets tossed out there. I don't know the veracity of the report that was was out there. I mean if you look at the facts. If you traded Lindor and Clevenger separately you get so much more than if you treated them together, you could find a team desperate for starting pitching trade them Clevenger and get a top prospect. And then some you trade Lindor and Clevenger together and it's like yeah, you're gonna get a huge haul but you could get a huge haul for both of them separately. I think the the more realistic thing first of all as I've said they're going to go to Clevenger and Bieber at some point in the next month or two and say let's talk Extension. I think there's a better chance Beaver signs agrees to something then Clevenger does but as we said like Clevenger was a late bloomer. He's about to be 29 years old. It's going to hit free agency at about 30 right before his 32nd birthday. I don't know if it seems going to give you that. They're not going to give you the Gerrit Cole Stephen Strasburg type deal at that age. So it's and you gotta prove yourself in the next three years. So it's a little riskier. So maybe he signs. Maybe he doesn't if he doesn't And I think he does become a logical trade candidate a year from now not the type of thing where like Trevor Bauer where they really wanted to get rid of them. But you explore just like they have with tons of other guys, but I don't think it makes much sense to trade him. Now. I don't think it makes any sense to include him in a Lindor deal to sweeten the pot. I think you could dangle kluber in that package certainly maybe a younger picture. But yeah, I think you keep them separate and then During Bieber or the reason why you feel like whether you trade Linda or not, you're still going to contend and be a threat to win the division and make some noise in the playoffs.	1.0
Oh, are you thinking wait think I let me shout out Pete Rock to I forgot to mention Pete Rock man. I don't want to my cousin a killed me if I didn't say.	-1.0
Well Spurs are a bit of a project or name when he took them on you can go in any way. We don't worry about it. No, no stay. Oh, I don't put would have porch. I'm Geoff Emerick.

I felt bad for Naomi though having to work for with Valentina. I'm surprised the trees didn't put Monique with Valentina because they kind of have like a rivalry going on. Yeah and you know Monique and Monet they have like This friendship and they're always working together. I don't know like I'm kind of like I wish they wouldn't work as together as much personally because it's kind of like that's what I think that this challenge is right up their alley. Yes. Yes. So them that they needed Mark you can speak.	-1.0
Oh I have music that is I have a lot of music bars. I don't do gels rarely. Will I have a job if I didn't have a home on the weekend might endure during the be a team on this year only will I have one if I need a little bit of caffeine on have a caffeinated gel on me but I have just food Just Like Music bars. I have scraps like rats with veggie my avocado or peanut butter and jam. I'm started having those fruit patches that you can get Supermarket. They're pretty good is easy to digest this. Whatever's going at the checkpoint chips a good machine and Ginger Beer Mile of our ginger beer is great. If you're feeling a bit funny in the stomach as chocolate-coated Ginger is really good. Just one of those is a really good pick me up. So yeah, probably all the food you shouldn't be eating I will have during an ultra. Yes if it tastes good. This food is fantastic. No, I think that's pretty well covered. Yeah, run run. I think I think the gyms out of today are run by Fuel run often. Don't go too fast and have fun. Yeah, and yes had fun. There's no rules in Rain. No dude there really is. I'm Hazel and enjoy it and you know if that means A hundred and seventy times a week like Lauren dust or let's go for yeah. Yeah, I think just don't be afraid of the bit of trial and error and don't let other people's definitions of successful. Whatever ideas of what you should or shouldn't do Define your ideas and goals. I think, you know, you know yourself better than anyone, you know to what you feel works for you and sometimes it might work. Sometimes it won't but you can only really know for sure if you dry. It someone can tell you. Oh, this won't work. But you won't really understand it in unless you try it so dude. Just don't worry. If you don't fit the mold, I think it's fantastic advice to forgetful advice.	1.0
And like okay, I'm standing there looking at this lady.	0.0
Yeah, that was the thing that surprised me because I stumbled over I think it was I was Googling it and I saw Kotaku like they had at this press release that respawn might drop Apex Legends. Like what is this and it they had like Titanfall 3 kind of linked into the article itself. And then when it clicked on live stream, that was when I realized oh by the way guys, you can play it tonight so that yeah, I I didn't I didn't hear about it before the day.

Let's see interior defense Supply and Kaylin Saunders. I do not see him. Let me go through quickly through the draft. I didn't go through every name. So let me deal with check really quick. Kalin Saunders went off the board to the Indianapolis Colts at pick 89 at pick 89.	-1.0
Exactly. Then number six. We got the slums. The slums is probably one of my more favorite ones and it's kind of I think it'd be kind of similar to skull town where you might not be able to get the best quality, but there is a lot Yes, I maybe it's because of all the different buildings and it's similar to skull town. But obviously just slightly different. I do like I almost always go up to the to the places up on the zip line up in the caves. I almost always go there and I'm usually able to find you know decent gear up there. I might not I mean, I might not find like the best obviously but I find some decent stuff up there plus depending on if I'm playing with randos, which is almost all the time. But if I'm playing with randos not a a lot of them think to go up there so we don't have to struggle to get loot.	1.0
Yeah, if you have a trio of Thornhill Amos and then Josh Jones kind of up in the Box. I think you're in good shape. So we'll go with Juan Thornhill there and there he goes Dawson noxious went off the board Savage off the board. Am IA hooker to the Dolphins. So the Dolphins taking all of my topics Damien Harris off the board. Renault Ren from Arizona State to the Titans for you, drew Sammy off the board mile Sanders to the Texans Riley Ridley to the Lions. The hell warring a good tight end of the Cowboys JSA a white side to the Chargers. as we slowly work our way through round three max Crosby Edge from Eastern Michigan to the Jaguars is looking for notable names. This was Anthony Nelson final pick of the round to the Ravens as we're now in round 4, so we have two more picks left in this Mock. And in this podcast David Montgomery just went to the Buccaneers if this if this simulation were to hold So Packers, I'll pick one 14. Last pic was Will Harris from Boston College. So top five I'll go top 10 players. I'm getting later in the in the draft process. Number one Prospect out. There is Miles Boykin from Notre Dame wide receiver Josh Oliver from San Jose State tight end is the second top prospect. Jajuan Johnson safety from Miami Dairy is Slayton from Auburn wide receiver Connor McGovern Guard from Penn State. Antoine Wesley from Texas Tech treyvion Williams from Texas A&M a running back Jacoby Myers from NC State and Dennis daily from South Carolina and offensive tackle are the top prospects on the board according to the draft networks predictive board.	1.0
It wasn't like a nightmare needle that you'd like putting her on how the doctors kind of like a oh, no.	-1.0
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying like that's that's a few and look at TV Dude TV. Is also like all these Netflix deals that are all these twitch deals that you can stream certain shows on Amazon. That's like the next level because people want to be the content, you know, and I think just viewing the content isn't enough for our brains now just passively watching something you everyone wants to participate in it and Twitches like gaming is the ultimate medium. That's right because it's like a sub entertainment now, you know, it's like weird. It's like you it's chat is responsible for Providing a good stream in some ways. You know, it's like hey, it's a very strange phenomenon was he just did he talk about Twitch in that book or know? So I mean he taught he basically it's a really good book. I suggest everyone reads it but he basically talked about the emergence of like modern entertainment and the sense of like The Simpsons being the one to break the ground basically completely breaking the fourth wall inviting people to participate almost in the sense of like like this is ironic. I'm going to make fun of things in a very ironic way and You know it as an advice like as someone who's smart and pays attention like you can participate in that because only you understand this for reference. And then in the same same stance like Twitches in the live entertainment is the same way like you can under you are able to watch this at this present moment and can participate in it. So he's saying that basically his product prediction is that people will get more and more involved in the content that they consume until it becomes extremely homogeneous, you know. Yeah, it like breaks down the relationship of An audience number until everyone is up on the podium together. You know.	1.0
Well, I think I think you could I think That kind of comes with me trying to sell my own company to two people at or and these are clients that are different from those brand deals and air quotes So, I think that helps and I and I'm really glad that's that's why I should say, I'm really glad that that we have each other for that and Dave has a you know brings a whole aspect of his talent and I think that's what makes a good team. I'm so used to and I know you were one time shooting weddings, you're so used to being a one-man band. So and I can't stress enough how important it is to have a whole crew with you because there's	1.0
So, you know, make sure your house smells good make sure you look good and let's get started probably in the kitchen unless you need to straighten up the front entrance of your home real quick. I'm not talking about deeply cleaning the living areas. We'll get to that later in the show, but maybe you need to just kind of pick up. So that the front of your house looks presentable if someone were to stop by or come home early and let's get started in the kitchen.	1.0
Exactly. Well, I also think that's a common state of behavior. Like we could put this behaviorally into deprivation right when you deprive Yourself as something then how much more do you want to write? Like you're like, I can't be having this now. That's all I want. Right? I mean that's how it works. I mean it's even a simple as like don't think of a pink elephant now don't you want the Pink Elephant the think in your head so like I see how this works. Also. I assume when you're trying to stick to all these diets and like you create these contingencies if I'm only gonna reward myself when I do this for how many days I mean Casey what's one of the I feel like you've done like Whole 30? Yeah. Definitely. I've done probably everything and Whole 30. I actually thought was pretty good to just figure out if you had any sensitivities and I don't know if I'm that is something that you see But like eliminating like the top kind of things from your diet just to see if it does affect you right and then slowly reintroducing it. I like that style. But again, you are you're limiting yourself so you can't have carbs can't have gluten. So then guess what? All you freaking want is a pizza, right? Like you're like, I can't have it like, oh my God right versus that open flexibility or the psychology the psychological flexibility of being like I can have it if I want it does it? Serve my body right now. Is it going to make me feel good? Do I know the consequence of when I eat pizza? I feel sluggish. I may have you know, some Diet, you know some potty issues. So yeah, I like I love this is great.	1.0

That's like one of the funniest things ever for that all him off the top of his head him off the tie him and and Monique was just a man. That was such a fun set.	1.0
Yeah, AT&T you like my mom trying to relate to me.	0.0
Yeah, but the only thing that we did miss out on in a naughty sent me this in actually reminded me of it is originally if they had gotten a season 7 Scott was supposed to pass off somehow. I don't know what the logic behind it is, but he was supposed to pass off his Alpha to Liam so that Liam could take care of Beacon Hills while he was at school. And so I'm like does that He's not an alpha anymore. Like he's just gonna give it up. You know, it's just so crazy. But then Alex was going to be the new Teen Wolf and then they were going to you know, do this whole 2.0 thing and I remember Jeff talking about that. And so I'm like if the aunties knew that Scott wasn't the office and he gave it to a white boy I would die and I wanted to happen. It's Canon as far as I'm concerned.	0.0
So I emailed my story to CrossFit age. HQ and then Yeah, they give us a go sign giving us asking us for what will be the name of your box. So send us five names that you think of and back then I don't have any clue. It's like what will be the right thing.

I don't accept this Marie. Where are you Lorraine? I actually really did enjoy the episode. I actually thought it was a great Challenge and I will admit when they do great things. I thought it was a great. Challenge because it is something that drag queens have to do maybe not from start to finish creating the whole event, but I have a lot. Yeah, I have a lot to say later, but that's all I'll say right now and everyone who's joining us in the chat room.	1.0

So before I became a trainer, I was working at Cold Stone Creamery for Five years and that was you know, I had a great job there taught me a lot of character. I was cleaning every night taught me to bring the energy but how personal training came about was. I was training my mom and my dad one Saturday morning at Cal Fit and I was stretching them in the manager walked by and he approached me and said that I wasn't allowed to like instruct or tell them what to do because it would be a liability but He offered me an opportunity and he said if you take the certification through our club you could be a trainer for us and pass the certification and the rest was history. It's been four years since I've been trying to now it's crazy.	1.0
I accept your offer.	1.0
This is team died. So I you know, I got the kill and I got the respawn so I'm good. That's just to let you guys know if someone else is hopping on that zip line, right? It don't jump fun.	1.0
Well the sir. Bicoastal, so I started at Burma gooey and I end it at Eden. So the distance from biggity-boom Acuity or even is around 45 minute drive. I have gone further up the coast path / McGeary to town called narooma and down many which is kind of a little bit further than that 45 minutes, but that's probably the proximity because any further and removalist costs as you would know increase so I try and keep A bit in that Circle. Okay, very good.	1.0
The bull side of things for you guys. How many how many murders do you you guys breed a year?	-1.0
Okay, so we need to talk about that. This is what I'm so funny because I had completely forgot that happen. But that is actually how I think I got to know you and so I really do think that that was the turning point because that's when people are like Lenin he doesn't even like the show he just loves staring. Why would they invite him on and I remember cuz the very first guest Was Not Another Teen Wolf podcast test and then they had the Argent crew then I forget who was on after that. It was an artist was it not dot but Kendra. Okay. I can't remember her artist named Klaus some Kendrick laws something like that. It's like oh, yeah, right and it was all leaning very much one way. And so when there was kind of, you know thoughts of like, oh, let's have someone who's going Hysteric on like who are they going to choose? Who are they going to choose? I don't know that people were talking about it. But I think at that point that's when you kind of start with like, you know, I was kind of told XYZ and that's kind of where that all sparked it, but that's hilarious. I completely forgot about that.	1.0
Yes, and there's so much craziness to talk about.	1.0
Right like you need to because we need to take responsibility of that scene and you know in our areas if we don't have law enforcement there right away, you know, we need to be aware of how to handle it just enough to make it safe so we can work around it and then leave it alone. Like I'm telling people that No transferred into a Ziploc bag and things like that and put in your pocket to handle the police later. But yeah people need to be aware of secondary suppose for that type stuff for sure.	0.0
So anyway, Get those dishes done. I'll give you a little bit of time to do that. And then of course on most days well every day. You want to wipe your stovetop along with the countertops some days you want to remove the burners.	0.0

I just thought it was awful you that like Bobby Lonergan hates God phileas Fogg / - right back for layer. I think the guy is awful Miranda Center back. Yeah. I've got him Roger Johnson.

Okay, but why was the best place was right under her boobs or was that a way?	1.0
So the generally the naloxone has a shelf life and like 45 minutes 40 minutes somewhere around there I think and so the opiates will reattach to the ER opiate receptors in your body and then you'll start going on and not again, so it's just exactly what sounds like you're nodding off asleep you're falling asleep. So they could potentially go down again generally will give repeat doses over with them or by that time the hospital will end up giving a repeat dose if they're still willing to stay in the hospital. Some people actually go on the locks on drip in the Bill because they've got such strong opiates in their system.	-1.0
It was it was it was he told me that Like after he was talking to the lady like after we explained the we're walking away and I'm like, so what just happened because I'm still trying to confuse.

And I was told like there could be a hug or a kiss which there wasn't a hug or a kiss but it was a big steric moment and it was like, why is the show actively trying to like kill steric but then have a moment like that where you have Derek dying and so many different like the he was going back to Styles over and over and over again.

Well when they show you one just didn't tell the story did it we could have beat him up five one on the day really and five shots on target is Philip. I think Villa did Miss grealish, but they were so bad. I mean they do today. I looked at that I thought yeah, they're getting relegated in. It's the best of sin tree or a human hairs and jata combined. I thought they're absolutely lethal and obviously Doherty and Johnny and they're like we say like you got to be scoring up the score more the chance and yeah, that's it had to a good was there never is his goal. I thought it's been really clever at the time I said because I said to my dad this is going to be s a very respectable to come in this coming out to neighbors and it happened and I was thought I was the best thing ever to put that on there and then people said, let's do it on the radio and they're going Everyone in the ground could see what then is you can do but I did leave any words. I mean never sees my very much all the boxes left him on his own very naively little run up the knee little shimmy Runner. Here we go. Great finish.

Right but but over, you know over the years that followed, you know, I kept on like I said reading magazines about it. And this is like in the, you know, pretty early days of the internet and IMDb had just come out and so it used to be so okay, even before that. I would go to this video store and they had like a big like movie catalog or not catalog but like an encyclopedia and so like, you know, the first person I went looked up with James Cameron because he's who wrote directed Terminator 2 and so I could find out like it wasn't as easy back then to find out who You know what filmmaker like what movies he done like a complete like, you know filmography, but then, you know IMDb came out and and suddenly I was able to like search for this stuff. It was all just like text back then right? I was about to say IMDb wasn't out yet. You nailed it? Yeah. Yeah. That's our reference. Now. That's that is our dictionaries. We like I probably Search IMDb for piece of trivia. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 10 to 15 times a day easily totally easily and I'm definitely when you're watching a movie, right? Absolutely.	1.0

Then I'll wipe the rim everything that involves the area behind the hinges between the hinges all that throw those away and then I'll get a fresh wipe or wipes plural to wipe the flusher handle and then the back of the tank which can be kind of Dusty.	0.0
Yes, of course the problems that will accelerate but you'll see that what it boils down to its the following right? I mean industry and eventually any sort of productive activity that is not related to tourism. So welcoming British Dutch Austrian and German tourists will just wither away. That's what it boils down to. So these countries then if they stay in the Eurozone, they will have this kind of Fate. It's the writing on the wall.	-1.0
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. And that basically has a link to my speaking that I do. So now I'm out here. I'm traveling around America. I'm off to Kansas City Missouri for my first trip next Wednesday to go and speak at a big conference. I've done Amazon Snapchat. Viacom Microsoft like all the big companies and I just love it. I really really enjoyed getting out speaking to these companies and these businesses and people and just sharing all of the things I've learned about life and all of these cool stories and just lighting a fire up that everyone's asses so that they start to live again because people go through shit, you know what it's like you don't know what the person next to you is going through. We all have these Amazing Stories and struggles and sometimes we just need that. That fire lit up under ass again. And so that's what I love to do aside from chocolate.	1.0

I just I just I just kept going and it was just that attention to detail and it was so specific and not one thing didn't not match everything worked perfectly. And I think that that's why they won over the other two because the other ones I felt was just kind of so General.	1.0
So we think this is wrong then why does why is it taken? Why isn't anybody else kind of picked up on it and said we'll hang on a minute. Keynesian economics doesn't really work as it should Austrian economics does and of course there are many Austrian economics proponents out there who are trying to fight their corner, but if it It is so obviously correct.

So giving a lot of toxic information that has been very destructive for me. And the people that I know and love. Yeah, and I just think they're too young and inexperienced and they don't have enough like a wide enough grasp of the world to actually speak to those topics at the top of their intelligence because you know, you're not supposed to question. You also brought up before like we are taught to fear our emotions they always use the Verse, that's like the heart is deceitful.	-1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, that's great. Well, I really love following all the different businesses on Instagram and watching them grow. You just reminded me of something that I was in my early. Sighs I did make contact with a lot of real estate agents and I didn't hear from a few of them and then at least 12 months later one of them replied to my email. So it's like they kind of knew were there but they didn't really need you with that time or they weren't really convinced. You could help them at that time that they they eventually came around. So it's a nice like pass very slow burn slow so bad. Yeah.	1.0

It was Riley's ornament from when he was a year. Year and a half with his handprint. I don't have anything else with his handprint on it from that time and it is is broken and I'm like, oh my gosh, and of course, I turned to my husband and I'm like, why did you not put these ornaments? Hopefully, I like totally blanked him right for these ornaments and he's like if like really like you should have put you should have put it away.

You had a CD of my band if I found one that would be awesome. It's very dated and very shit.	1.0
Yeah, and that's one thing we did. I mean that's why we put them on our trucks initially as well as is. Yes. Anybody can be trained to use this cat like there is young children that know how to use these kits and can can administrate them. However, you know for us responding we needed a plan. We need an operational guideline for a second as Bowser for us because I've seen it numerous First I'm the and I'm sure many other people have is where you're either in a residence or your Patty somebody down or you're trying to get them into the back of the ambulance or it's in a car accident where there's a lot of paraphernalia left over or sitting close to them. So if you get exposed to that and we need a plan for our size, so if we're not carrying it, we're not prepared then if we come across something and we need to administer it it's still there for us and you're totally covered under the Good Samaritan. I can be see anyways.	-1.0

You were being a little baby about once a your Christmas tree story and I want to let everyone know that you're being a baby and get a word in your fucking goddamn, right?

Well, I think what we've noticed and talking when owners and studying. This is just a lack of vision at the onset of the project if owners and contractors alike are coming into a particular project opportunity and they're aligned on what possible from an off-site standpoint that really bodes well for maximizing the prefabrication or off-site potential on the project. It's I think it's what works hard as if there's a basic project that gets design and then a contractor or a contractor in a designer than says all right, what part of this can we can we manufacture off-site since having that alignment going in from the beginning with owner the engineer and a contractor all aligned saying this is this is really how we want to achieve this any kind of modular design any kind of prefabrication off-site construction really originates in the planning period of the construction process, right?	1.0
I'm just saying let's not act like there's no act like it ain't you ain't true that you know allegations ain't always been out there Sion right on stuff. Yeah. I thought that that very first song that actually opening track which was I believe it was father for got really personal talk about, you know, his oldest son and all the stuff saying how you know, he was 17 when you had them and she like that I felt that shit that shit was that shit was kind of tough. Okay, and then you touched on like him, you know getting in the beef and shit like that with other rappers and stuff like that. I just seen like Snippets of the stuff with him on that Ebro and he still talking popping off his like second. I wanted to get behind them after I watch that Breakfast Club interview that he did it was like, okay, maybe he's in misunderstood. He turn right back around saying how like the you know, the older the older generation should basically should you know should thank them and shit like that. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Like come off am like we were I was rooting know the hold the Vivica Fox me my was rooting for you. That's that's how I was now. It's kind of like, I don't know FAMU just you switching up on me too much. So yeah with that being said those would have the songs that I like the most on it without no talking too much on it at that made man was hot. It was probably that was probably my favorite song at all. A made man was hot like the said the Wild Wild West Joy I'm with her. I wasn't gonna that shit was tight to and I said the cardi B Carter be stole that, you know saying she had the best verse on on the whole album to me do anything for clout? Yeah. She had the best verse on the album on the entire album with all those features Gucci. It was a lot of features to like, I think it was like 16 songs and like eight of the songs have features on them. So that's a bit much for my for my taste. I mean, you got 16 songs. I don't want to see more than like for features. Just my personal my personal preference, but that for that I'll give it a go give it a two and a half out of five. I'm gonna give it a two and a half. It was the best out of every solo project from them.	0.0

Ann's in the fandom would get like we would get messages and like diems from people who are Anonymous who were like with the show and like there was instance where people from the show would like give us spoilers of like what's going to happen and it would be like written in a very vague kind of way but like you can get like the just of it and then when like the show kind of started turning against Eric, we would still get or at least I did we Get messages from like inserts in the show of like ways to like be one step ahead of like their mess. It's to like actively post about it. So that way when it came out fans will like already like in the know like fans already knew what the mess was going to be like had a way to like prepare for just how shitty the show was which was weird. Like I want to know who these people were who were like on the side of the fandom and not on the Side of the show like who like who would risk their job to do that? It didn't make sense. Here.	-1.0

I also wanted to point out. When did I? You know, this is this is part of the actual plot of the show. But like all of our at one point is like two feet from three people that he's close with Robbie Miley and Lily and he doesn't recognize any of them like something died down but like he knows their voices. You don't probably looks the same and I'm going to say this about the other ones who like, I don't know like he is Robby Ray and he always talks about Hannah Montana being his daughter.	-1.0

So he's he had just had her and you know went to his house where he was staying with his girlfriend at the time, so I went over there. The next day went over there and hung out and it was just I remember was just like a odd feeling because you know, I had built up had so much resentment and anger at that point, even though I was only 12, but I was I guess I opened myself like I let me see what this is about and then you know, two three days later.

I know lately. I've been using bars of soap in the master bathroom. My husband and I each have our own sink were pretty much the only people that use those things. I mean occasionally akid might wash their hands their if they used our restroom, but for the most part I have my own sink, he has his own sake and then the kids share a bathroom. So I decided that we didn't really need to have a pump of hand soap in the bathroom and I might change on this later. But right now I keep just a bar of soap but it's sink and one of the reasons I like to do that is sometimes if I'm getting ready in a hurry and I'm not going to take a shower that morning.	1.0

I'm okay, but real talk like the whole room disappeared and I'm just staring at her and got caught her eye. She staring at me and I was kind of you know, shy so we kind of both shuffled and kind of made like a Mid-ground like I'm not going to your sides. You're not going to my side and then I think I just walked past and I just like your eyes are beautiful and she was like, so are yours and then that was it? Okay. I got the number.

What is happening off the top of my head is movie studios hired this AI. Oh, yeah to determine to like read the scripts and determine What actors Is and actions is to use that will be most beneficial to well Studio. Yeah, I don't I don't like that. I don't like that at all art. It's not a science death of an industry. I mean the Rocks going to have 37 movies next and what happens breakout roles, you know what I mean? Yeah really know that person or you never thought they'd be right for that role Bruce Willis for thy heart that would have never came to be if this AI test for sure bail would have never been Batman. I know boom never little bit of the rock. Yeah. What maybe this will finally be the end of Will Smith though? I don't think so. Don't keep us are looking at the Hard numbers and realize he's not doing as well as everyone thinks a b or he'll be in every movie If I had to bet I'd bet the a ice pick and Will Smith foremost rule. No not after they see I will try and kill him. Yeah. Exactly. I Robot there's no way we'll spend any more movies dude. I gotta admit those little Instagram promos those little clips for Bad Boys 3 is 3 it's coming out. Yeah. Your life not good. No no from you pop Dancy little cheap-ass Graphics in the background. This is interesting for me. All it takes is a fast car an explosion in your in usually easily. I would be all about this is got my boys in it, but don't green-screen me a fucking girl dance video and pull for your movie. I loved it. So maybe it's gonna suck. Maybe this is in a while Smith. Maybe I have to eat shit after this movie of the in the next same lines in the trailer that they And all the other no, no way. It's bad boys meets 21 Jump Street. They got all these like yesterday.

A question that I wanted to know and I think it's probably going to be different for every Rodeo guy. But what you said you buy most of your Bulls are all of them what you just bought some seen some dummy trips on what are you looking for? I mean, you know, you're not you're not competing with them. It doesn't sound like so what's the few quality traits that you really looking for in a good one? Well well Oh guys look at the air and kick and spin but then for for me that that I guess that's I like speed. I you know might Corey and I always round and round about this because you know, I like I said a little bit ago Mike Corey and I are good buddies and bikes been at Northwest bull man for years and and he's in the break over Bulls. He likes bulls that that break over and old knock your job. You don't hang around you've been hanging around on kiss so long, you got the same flavor. He does with the speed a little bit when they have that intensity and speed all I know I like him to kick. I'm not gonna happen. But you know, but you do look at you do look at this. That X does a lot. You know, there's a lot of guys that even in this day and age they don't care how they read.	1.0
I think it's more the latter. I mean for me, you know not having a relationship with my biological father is it?

Yeah, and this is why you know, and he's like, oh my God, I'm so sorry like, okay like we always talk so knock on wood. We have yet to fight good and he's just so inspiring to and you're not in a great mood. He knows how to like lift you up and make you feel comfortable. And I think that's what she needs as well because no one really knew what she can do on the show and you know, She's super talented when she does but no one has ever seen her dance before and that's difficult when you're not a dancer, you know, so I feel like he's the perfect partner for her to just make her feel comfortable and no matter what just support her and they work so well together. They have the best chemistry.	1.0

Right? And I think it's interesting because first of all like a Navy a how we have to have like an individualized plan for every person based on their needs whatever it is, but that and also it makes me think of when we talk about validity and as we know validity is the idea is something NG men measuring the relevant Dimension that you intended to measure so right so like I might be like, oh my God, she is so healthy. She's so skinny. Right? Like I'm thinking that they're right her body looking a certain way that that indicates that she's healthy, but that's not really a valid measurement. Right? Like that's not valid if I'm measuring someone's like level of Health. However, you plan on measuring it it wouldn't be there skinny. Like when I think about it after I was hospitalized and so sick. I lost 25 pounds. I felt sexier than ever. But I was at my most unhealthy point of my entire life. I mean, you know, like everything was wrong with me. And so, you know to try measure like, oh she must be healthy. She lost 25 pounds. She's so on her shit, right? Like little did they know my fingers are falling off in the background or whatever is going on that. I'm sorry. I had c-diff or you know, like your body is completely out of whack at that point. So I think that's an interesting site on validity in terms of what we think measures. Health or what? We thinks measure someone having their life together or you know, and it's not actually that at all.	-1.0
So so opiates there are several nervous system depressant. So people think they called an overdose emergency by this actually respiratory emergency like it's going to decrease your Drive so much. You're going to be very slow respirations to know respirations. So when we talk about signs and symptoms, those are a lot of the signs that we looked at. We looked at what's their breathing rate is going to be like eight respirations and minute or less or not reading at all. Now they're going to be signed on if it'll be blue in the lips pale blue. The fingertips could be very sweaty or die Frederick it go to be little bit of vomitus or foam in there are way as well and then the pinpoint people sort of are the other tell Tale sign right there is what some crews are seeing now. They're seeing some other drugs on board that are really they're still keeping them depressed. So we're giving them the locks on and it's knocking off the little bits off of your opiate receptors and blocking it appropriately where it should be but the people are still saying depressed from another drug on board so I can benzodiazepines and other things like that. So, What what we're seeing now with that is that still that respiratory emergency like you we can't forget that we need to breathe for these people on all oxygenate them and then transport them. So in our back to our kits and suffering of that were teaching is we follow this the save me campaign so stands for stimulate Airway ventilate evaluate your medication and then evaluate again, so we want to stimulate try and get them. Awake painful stimulation see if they respond at all. They don't respond. Then we go into the airway. So we're opening their Airway. Then we're going to be ventilating because it's that central nervous system depressant is depressing their respiratory drive and we want to auction auction them and breathe for them. We want to breathe one breath every five seconds for them and we can keep them alive and keep them sustained by breathing for them without even giving them logs on fruit and then after that then I'll give more value eight if there's no real response and we get into her medication and then at that point we will be administering your first story dose of point for intramuscular. So we taught everybody had a breakdown feels drawn up properly and landmark throw it in a few other Miss like that people think need to expose the scan. You can't you can go right through the clothing if you have to sew in the deltoid or the thighs the best spot as well.	-1.0
Well, I mean the difficulty I don't see the difficulty there. That's not come from the fact that the others would be performing better by the Blazing their own currencies, but what they do is just to redistribute existing resources. Thibault, the politically well connected to the detriment of the others the problem I think for for this is ordinarily right for a country that has a sound o better money that other countries right now we've been doing for 10 years now, we've made great efforts to make sure that Swiss franc the British pound Euro and the American dollar becoming more is the same thing as really very few changes. No many just options that we exchange rates and so on but let's say if you have known and foreseeable differences the quality of money to different country. So one country is more inflationary the other is that this stationary What happens is that promotes? Exports on those countries that have a worse money because the residents of those countries. Well, they want to reduce Autumn minimize their Holdings of their own inflationary money as much as possible, right so they want to get hold of a better money. This is what you see in all countries that are so dollar rise rise the phenomena of polarization. All of these countries have export surpluses and the strings from the fact that they need to pay for the dollars that they really want to own. They don't want to all their own. Local pocket money they want to own as our bodies such as the last so long since nobody's giving the colors they need to buy them. So they export so they have a structural export Surplus and therefore countries with the better money than structural import circles. All right. So the the industry is those countries are suffering under foreign competition precisely because foreigners want to get some of the local Honey, that's the reason why the US for example as structural import deficit because many more even though the dollar might be quite lousy as a money, especially as compared to Gold. It's still better than most of the other monies that are around in the world. So people want to buy buy dollars and there are therefore they need to export services to get those those dollars from the US and therefore soup President Trump's policies that try to reverse this trend just with Exponent important controls with tariffs and so on will not succeed. Simply for this reason you see so the difficulty of such a country is not that the police use of work would not workers not before the country. It's that it creates pressure on the local producers. And so you get political resistance from that definitely that's that's brilliant.	1.0

Deadline or something like this and she still submitted it with it, like whether it was a desert might as well submitted it and we had like 2 million views on it. Literally we're in like wow practice out father. It is real. I can practice outfits sweating like barely any makeup barely did my hair.

It was a different time again. Like when we look at how it is. Now, everything is so fluid and you know, but before everything was so rigid like this. Is he even back then it was like whoa. If you do television, you'll never be a film star. If you know, if you do film you can't go to tell like people looked at television like it was beneath the people still looked at, you know, you can go on to be a Broadway Legend and like with the music The Duality thing was was kind of rare back then I mean even when you go back before my time is You know, very make Barbra Streisand, you know what I mean? And Frank Sinatra was never really considered an actor. They were just taking advantage of situations, but you didn't certainly from the black side of things. You can see that Duality like that. So, you know, I never really everything happens for a reason and I know I put my all into it so I don't have any regrets in that way. Like I never feel like oh if I would have took this seriously like not took it seriously. I got I got thousands of songs in the stash.

And then there's like a little couch with the TV but the whole place is just it's just absolute like right now, it's like my wife any time she walks in the house. She says this place is a fucking disaster and like seven out of ten times no fun six out of ten times. That's true. Most of the time is just like chill is Not that big a deal relax downstairs is almost always a disaster like every toy they have they pull out. It's everywhere if they eat something down there. They don't bring it back up fucking yogurt containers mini-muffin bags and all that shit fucking goldfish crumbs everywhere absolute it's really hard and telling them to like go down and clean their room.	-1.0

I think oh gosh. we'll jump was in there somewhere and then I can't remember what the can't remember the Oldham it is and I'm like, you know, I think that could be the only way that like a straight-up pilot could make its way into it is that if the clinic call in the Titan and then that kind of defeats the purpose of it, but to have a character who could like double jump or whatever that yeah, that could kind of be like a grappling hook or a jump pad in a sense that you know, hey, I'm just going to double jump and as long as that was like his passive and it wasn't like Then you had to like recharge on I don't know that could be kind of cool.

It's actually like deals just as good as neikei even better. So so that's a little bit of a problem because it's like $1,000 less. Yeah. I don't know what you do. It's good. Isn't it? Good, right.	1.0

I'm like gonna jump it and then what is it? Oh heart 75. Oh, it's awful don't do it, but it was basically two workouts a day. You had the E stick to eat like an eating diet of your choice. You had to read a 10-page to 10 pages of a self-help book a day and no alcohol for 75 days if you missed you had to start over so it's like a hardcore. Yeah, it's hardcore. It's like a yeah, it's super hardcore. So I was like am I like I was I was to the point I was like, okay. I'm in a good place. I think I can do this. I'd like to get kind of myself situated and it was like a gave me enough time that I would be done by Thanksgiving. Well, we're obviously Asleep, we're not there in five minutes.	1.0

That's that's rough math. Like they say there's all the time and the music industry. Designed to keep you in debt and this is just another example of it man. It's a lot of these little backwards deals that they that they toss in there to keep you to keep you working to keep they pockets lace while you get next to nothing out of it. It's just it's sad bro. Like I don't ever want to see nobody go through that. Especially someone that works like, you know, the way we know all know Kanye works okay ago in the hibernation and work for like 6 to 7 months straight. No and very seldom calling out for For some time. So I just think that's it's just toughness like never Rockefeller of all, you know of all places like kind of crazy. It just makes you think different about a lot of people that we'd be celebrating even the labels that we'd like yo, they was getting it. It's like yeah, but at what cost a lot of people like basically selling a soul just to get on and years later 15 years later. They still can't they can't even break free of that shit. Like I was just explained with the de la Sol's Shit that they came out with 30 years ago today, you know saying they can't even say not even getting money off of that which is crazy.

And he's like, well this woman you gave me told me to eat it, right and then he's like, well this serpent told me to eat it, right I mean It is so much easier to blame other people or to play victim really right and knew that victim word is like dang know like none of us want to admit it. But we do and that is just us as humans, right? That's why we have to go to God and a girl. Let me tell you when I was like, I mean I got upset at my husband, but also the Holy Spirit told me like Eva.	-1.0

Well, you know the turning point it what they were quieter, but it was because the show was supporting steric a at that point still and so as soon as bizarre weird Twisted happened just like with the stupid election, they became emboldened and we're like very just going to spread our hey, I do want to talk more about the poses mom thing and of course, you know, there is a bit of sensitivity to the issues since she has passed but I thought that that was so foul. And that's really if anything that got me. Twisted and what steric was actually about it was that because that was dirty on another level when it came to the Scott stands and they're like for them to go to her and then be like, well he say he made death threats against your son never happened and they're just like, why would you tell her that and then of course, she's like, oh who's this whole the wolf person she needs to get along just completely clueless and like okay, Mom. AMA lecture, but it was just so it's just thing that's kind of happening that kind of happened with Megan Tandy that still really upsets me is that like they go to her specifically to turn them against us when it's like we don't have a problem with you.	-1.0
Be alright, it's being it's been an example to indict and just letting your students watch you WEA know wholeheartedly these kids mimic every single thing we do. So imagine if if you smiled and said hello to every person across your path, you know, we talked to think in one of the previous episodes about getting kids to to learn the names of other staff members, right? And I mean, that's something that could be considered a kind act when you can call someone by name rather than just just waving or giving a head nod, you know, so that's a simple step. Inclusion is another big one and I don't mean on the the classroom inclusion of you know, different grade levels and abilities and it just including people in your everyday conversations. I just think that's an important lesson we can teach to all kids that we include people who might not feel included you'll see that in bullying statistics all the time. What if you know, what if what if what if one person had someone sit with him at lunch or that one person that someone sits on the playground so kindness as a whole can be stretched in Seoul The different directions and so many philosophies and so many ideas or things but it doesn't have to be the purchase of an item or an idea that your intently doing. It just just just be a good human being, you know, the way that the way that you would want to be treated, right?	1.0
