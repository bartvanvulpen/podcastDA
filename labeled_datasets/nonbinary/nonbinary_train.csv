You know, I think that Doing things at an extreme measure like trying to do everything all at once can be paralyzing. Let's say like it's decision paralysis when you tell somebody I want you to do an hour of cardio a day. I want you to count your calories. I want you have this much water. I want you to sleep this wedge apple cider vinegar. I want you to have 30 25 to 35 grams of fiber at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you throw too much shot them they kind of get like get stuck it in there. Yeah, so I try to give them a smart goals something that's specific something that's measurable. All something that's realistic attainable the timely and example of a smart goal is I want you to lose four pounds in four weeks. I want you to track your water intake. I want you to track your way and every single day and then at the end of each week take the average of your weight and the compared to the next and to the next so it's like once I hear yeah, you're not you're not looking day-to-day measurements. You're looking at weekly measurements and on average. So you get a general idea of where your weight is. Actually that's kind of like stocks, you know goes up it goes down. But where is the general Trend going, you know? A lot of fluctuations that people have our water weight fluctuations. You have salt you have sugar you have alcohol you have menstruation. You have stress. You have sleep. You have so many things fiber that affect your water weight at that particular point. So it's important to take your weigh-ins average them out compared to the next week. So you get a general idea. Am I really losing weight and my maintaining what's the rate at my loser? Because you can lose the to 3 pounds a day go in the sauna cut your car. Yeah, you know eat clean and that's just a lot of water weight. Illusion, but if you're talking about fat loss fat loss takes time. Yeah about 1 pound per week. Gotcha.	-1.0

Right and the Indians could prey on that because they could just say well we'll keep them. He's a perennial All-Star will keep him for two years. We don't have to trade him to you but along those lines I'm also Thinking it's only a matter of time before another team gets in the mix or is leaked to be in the mix because that just drives it up even more. You know, if the Dodgers insist they don't want to include Gavin Lux. Well, then the Indians can leak to someone and say hey we've talked to the Atlanta Braves or the Cincinnati Reds or another team about a Lindor trade and and then maybe the Dodgers get a little more desperate. But you know, I also think having just I'm Just going to completely debunk everything. I just said I also think front office's don't fall for that stuff the way we all do media fans the public, you know, I think they have a pretty good grasp of what's really going on. And yes, they do pay attention to trade rumors and and National reporters and whatnot. But you know that they use that to check on things to get what the legitimate scoop is and not necessarily what's out there. So it's going to be interesting. You're right. You know how desperate to the Dodgers get do they really feel like Gavin Lux can be as good as Francisco Lindor and more importantly do they feel like he can be as good as Lindor right now. I don't know but I mean you look up and down that roster and there's like 15 to 20 guys. I'd have interest in if I was if I were the Indians, I mean, there are so many directions they could go but you probably need Lux in the deal to feel comfortable because this isn't just this isn't just like Find the best match and let's do it. This is overwhelm us enough that we feel comfortable going to ownership and convincing them to sell their franchise face of the franchise and you know, probably sacrifice some season ticket sales and some fan sentiment knowing that hey you might be a better team and you'll certainly be a better team long-term Beyond 20/20 one. But like this is going to sting even if you get a really good return even if you quote unquote win the The trade and all the people who love to get a handout letter grades 10 seconds after a trade happens for some reason, you know, you're even if you win those and you get an A-Plus like it's still going to hurt at the Ballpark at in the ticket office. So you're going to have to be overwhelmed. That's why I think Lux probably has to be in the deal no matter what even if you to a mean like in a vacuum like Dustin may + Alex Verdugo + Chris Taylor plus Joc Pederson Plus Like Max Muncie is an amazing Hall. But like I still think I still think it's got to be Luxe. I still think you need that Marquee slam-dunk piece. And I think especially Indians fans by now are probably saying it's got to be Luxor.	1.0

Okay, so we covered two things in the meta first was that there was a lot of guard plane and a lot of the really successful competitors were guard players, but they were many successful top players to I don't mean to exclude them second as far as positions that we saw a lot of we saw a lot of half guard and Butterfly guard particularly from like lockers I should mention I didn't plan to mention this but we did see tons of inversions all weekend long. And what was interesting about the inversions and tells you that it's very clearly a part of the meta was that different styles of jujitsu were doing inversion. So we saw a Geo Martinez the 10th plant style both him and Elvira and Thor were all doing in versions. But then we also saw of course Paulo me out doing invert attacks. I think we saw Kennedy doing invert inversion attacks and some of the female competitors were I'm them too. And they all had kind of different purposes for doing them. Who was the guy that beat a Luca slippery. I have to check because I'm going to be people are gonna be mad if I forget his name, okay, it was Dante Leone. He maybe had the upset of the tournament. He beat Luca slippery and he did it with inversions. But his were more sort of traditional backed a conversions and I think he took Luke. He definitely took Lucas's back once he might have taken it twice, but he just had some bro. Inversions that he was working in a couple of his matches. So what that tells you is that inversions are useful for different competitors with different sort of game plans and strengths and weaknesses. So it's something to look into if you're playing more of an open guard game particularly. If you're like Locker another Trend that I noticed this weekend was how important the back attack was and what I notice in this is again something that as I was watching it. I kind of like asteroid like hey, are you seeing this a lot? Lot the last couple days, which is that competitors were really not interested in being in the mounts and they were very not interested in being in side control. I really shallow side control for more than a couple seconds 80cc. You didn't see a whole lot of guys working attacks from the mount everyone wanted the back to the point where a lot of people would not even pass card. They would they would try to attack the back straight from inside people's guard. That's where kind of law the inversions came along. And also what you saw when people hit takedowns is they would go straight from a takedown and they would try to get to the back within you know, as fast as they could they weren't interested in doing those traditional pit stops that a lot of you know blue and purple belts would do which is you know, stop at side control, you know, take a second consolidate your win and your points and then go to the next thing and then go to the next thing these guys wanted to go straight there. Now, this could just be kind of in a DCC thing. Thing again because of the to shoulder rule which is that you saw a lot of competitors that they were trying to keep their shoulders off the mat and in doing so maybe they expose their back and it's also possible that at this really high level a lot of people have figured out that it's just almost impossible to pass some of these guys and girls guards. So it's better for them to just try to attack leg locks and kind of chain that with taking the back interesting thing is that Keenan Cornelius did a podcast in the summer. On Flow grappling and he kind of predicted this he said that in this was, you know way before atcc and he said the way noogie grappling is shaping up right now. I think that passing the guard is going to become less and less important because people are just going to be attacking leg locks from the garden if that doesn't work. They're going to tries to go straight for back takes and I definitely felt like that was happening at a TCC. Also worth noting that the rear naked choke was the top finisher 80cc again. I think I'm going from memory. I think there were 35 submissions and nine of those were rear naked choke 6. While we're on the subject of numbers, which is one of our favorite things at high percentage. I think the order of submissions was rnc's was the first heel hooks where the second and then the third was Guillotines and I was actually was very pleased to see this because this really matches up with a lot of the data that we've collected we've shown that in noogie matches the top-performing submissions across all belt levels are rear naked choke so Guillotines armbars and Now atcc heel hooks are a hundred percent legal. So they're going to be much more represented. Some of the research that we've done has been across different formats where different kinds of leg locks were not always legal. So when you're at the high level basically if you hooks your legal, they're going to be very well represented. But you know, we also showed that Guillotines were really high percentage at the noogie level, even though in the ghee we have other data that shows that there are very very low percentage. And the last thing that was very much on meta that we saw at a TCC was bodylock takedowns. So this is really interesting because body luck takedowns in the data that we've done at high percentage are not really anything special most people get better results from single legs sacrifice throws or just leg trips. So I don't think bodylock takedowns is necessarily going to translate to other formats, but A TCC a great example. This was JT Torres, which is that there were other competitors and I saw this throughout the weekend that we're trying to get single legs. But because you had to get both shoulders on the mat if you just kind of visualize in your head what a single leg looks at, its your entire body versus one of their legs. That's the kind of Jiu-Jitsu aspect of it. But really that's only good for kind of getting there. But down on the mat. There's you are not going to have upper body control. You have to let go of the leg and sort of All up and we definitely saw that atcc. So the competitors that had a lot of success were people that were doing bodylock takedowns or we're doing that kind of like double Leg Takedown where you know you land right on their on their diaphragm on their chest and then you effectively have upper body control and those takedowns in my experience are pretty Advanced take down. So, you know, you saw that there were some really good wrestlers like JT Torres that could pull those off. then everyone else I think just wisely made the calculation that hey why why I'll just I'll get in the guard and I'll try to work my game and get in a good position in the first half of the match and then if not, you know, we'll see what happens in overtime kind of thing now to kind of circle back to the question that was poised at the beginning of the podcast which is our leg locks still essentially The Meta kind of front and center and I would say yes for the time being they are we saw a lot of heel hook finishes. Some people commented that there were not as many leg locks is there were was in a TCC 2017 and if you look at the breakdown of the heel hooks, actually a lot of them happened in the absolute Division and a lot of them happens because of Lockland and getting I think he got like four leglock finishes three or four in his absolute run and that without him maybe the statistics would have kind of evened out a little bit. However, I would say he's not an anomaly because he He's able to go in there and make really good use of that skill set. One thing that I saw in a TCC is that I I felt like there was a clear distinction between the new school leg locking crew. That was at a TCC and some of the old school and old schools Probably sounds more pejorative than I mean it to be but we see this all the time in our gyms at home, which is there are some students and there. In some cases entire gyms that they just don't do the leg lock thing and maybe they learned defenses to it, but it's just not part of their repertoire. Some of it is, you know, the tradition and the history of it that some people just don't really believe in it may be an old school mentality kind of thing. But I definitely saw that ACC there was even a moment and this was a moment that was almost a metaphor for the entire thing. I'm talking about which is buchecha versus Gordon Ryan and Gordon Ryan. Was you know working his game and buchecha of course is a legendary competitor and he's known for having a pretty fundamental old school game. I think it's safe to say and there was a moment where buchecha was not faring. Well, I think he was down on points and he actually sat down for a leg attack and Gordon openly laughed at him and then buchecha started laughing in the middle of the match and then the entire audience tonal was chuckling for a Moment and the joke was is that you know buchecha would just he's not the guy that drops back for leg locks and I don't know why he did that. Maybe it was a desperation because he was down on points or something like that.	1.0

And so that's what stop trying to put a round Peg. Us into a square hole, you know when that was a big thing with everyone all of the couples that I spoke to they all said we spoke the vision. We made it clear. Hey, this is the guy especially hey, this is what I'm called to do. Are you willing to go with me? I'm not trying to like, oh this one. I think it can work. I was in a personally I was in a relationship back in the day that I was like trying to figure it out like oh, you know, this person's not exactly what I thought when I mentioned Ministry, they like froze like a deer in headlights, but I think we could make it work, you know like Like you need it if you're called to go into full-time Ministry. You shouldn't be looking for someone who's like who doesn't wanna have anything to do with it. I just want to stay home with the kids someone who's like I've talked about before someone who's like working for the weekend, you know, I just love to travel. I love going on vacation. You need someone who's like willing to work like there's a mission at hand. Adam didn't get Eve so she could like spend all his money and take them on vacation. So you could take on vacation like there needs to be a purpose behind your marriage. Even if it isn't Ministry if it's like, hey, we're We're Kingdom Minded people and that's the whole purpose of this podcast is like get you to be Kingdom Minded like your life isn't get an education get a good job retire at 65 and enjoy life as much as you can. That's not the gospel. The gospel isn't enjoy life. The gospel is take up your cross and follow Jesus like your life on this Earth, you're gaining treasure in heaven. You're going to spend eternity and treasure and maybe if you're lucky a hundred years on this earth like at a hundred and eight years at I tried hundred and twenty years at Max but our life here on Earth is is short. This is a time of sowing and reaping for eternity that you are making choices now. And so your marriage should be geared in that direction. We one of the things that was said and I'll go over some of the Practical boundaries, but they said that they didn't want to be always on the defensive so they had clear boundaries. Hey, we're not going in the house together by ourselves. We're never going the bedroom together. Even if there are people in the house there were some practical things. You know, I think I think you shouldn't be making out with somebody like full-on like making out with somebody before you're married. I think you know, it's crazy. It's 2019. It's normal in this day and age even by Christian standards like it's cool to fool around a little bit like but draw the line for yourselves everyone that I talk to and these are people that I look at and say they have a they have a good marriage. They all said, you know, we had clear lines and if any of them said hey, what do you if you could do things differently it was hey, I wish we had drawn more. Clear lines. I wish it had been clear. I wish we would have I wish we would have I was I wish the boundaries would have been better. No one said, you know, I think our boundaries were too strict.	-1.0

And if there's something that scares you then dive in deeper like yeah, it's scared me when I read, you know, women need to be silent at church. That was one of my really defining moments where I shut the Bible and looked up at God and just was like yo, Yeah, what like I was like so beside myself about that. I was like just like I've been honoring you all of these years and I'm made to like sit here and read that like, what does that mean? And it did not shake my faith. It didn't turn me away from God instead. It caused me to be more intellectual about my faith to be more curious about the history of it and I'm far from knowing everything but like People should be inspired to be intellectual not scared of it.	1.0

And I mean, I tried the beta out for Battlefield 5 and it was very much like okay, this is more Battlefield and it wasn't a bad thing necessarily. It's just that like when I looked at that plus all the other things coming out around it. I was like that $60 just ended up going somewhere else now technically now, I think I could probably end up picking up on like a really good deal or something, but then that's still like money that I'd have to put towards that instead of something.	-1.0

You don't share a lot of experiences and you know. Just enjoy we both both my cousin's we literally can just be in bed. Chill together eat good food. Have a good workout and just do the simple things in life. And it really doesn't matter what we do when I'm with them. It's just as long as we're together and I think that's the beauty of it is. It's very low maintenance, you know, just as long as we have each other we find gratitude in that and it's always a good time, you know, but with you know, Richard Nico both of them, you know, they Have they're like my best friend's, you know, they've been my best friends ever since I was younger and you know, keep it real with you guys, you know, as you get older things change feelings change people change. There's a lot of movement in life. And sometimes you forget about the people that helped you get to where you are and I think for me by my you know, the blessing my mom. She had told me a couple weeks ago that because it's miss me and and I wanted Create consistency and effort and shows them that I miss them too. And I know it's been hard and I know it's hasn't been things. Haven't been the same. So it's kind of like having that body bit about bodybuilding mentality, like whatever your weak points are in a relationship like focus on those like all the people in Sacramento. Like I see them consistently. I see my baby girl Cindy all the time. I see Kev, you know weekly, you know, it's about maybe investing time in to the people that you don't see a whole lot like I don't see my sister's a whole lot.

Very good. Well, maybe I'll touch on that comment that the Big Dreams for the business at the end. But before I go into that something that's kind of related in a way to the retail side or the or the fact that there's almost this second business or what what I'm seeing in the industry from particularly from some of the staging businesses who have been in business for a little while and looking to add other revenue streams. I'm seeing little online stores pop-up not too common. But I've seen a few come up on the websites and and look it does make sense given that we do all this research when we're sourcing the Quality Furniture and we can often get better pricing through trade discounts or wholesale pricing. So I understand it and I think you've kind of done this in a clever way. Not only that you've got the That we just talked about but you also have done I guess it kind of an online just store but you've specifically called them bedroom packages and you've set up it this online store to sell what is essentially Furniture but in a bedroom package and I haven't seen that done quite the same anywhere else. So I you know, I'm really interested in the thought process behind or you know, how you came about deciding to do something like this or testing it out and kind of how you found it.	1.0

Pete Rock true true Metro Boomin shout out the st. Louis Metro Boomin. Definitely. He was part of the the new age sound as well like the the current sound and also want to throw in Tyler the Creator. I think he's very underrated as an as a producer but he's definitely one of my favorites today as long as he's still making music. I just met my best results and I messed with this new sound. He definitely evolved a lot. So those are just so many people that I want to mention. It's definitely a lot more but To the one that I just wanted to to mention besides but the people to flock are you mentioned so it's a lot of good producers man. I just want to say that a lot of good producers back back in the day and and up until today. I know everybody's like looking for the new sound and I guess like right now you say like Pierre Pierre born. This is one of the people who has a lot of sounds that a lot of people emulate take Keith. I feel like he he does a lot of frickin Beast that sound the same to he's finally trying to expand but he would definitely do a lot of a lot of bees that sounded the exact same and I was like what the hell is is but a lot of you trying to lay his stuff. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's as far as well. I can think of right now, but but she also produces man because like I said everyone for y'all, I really think that a lot of these people would sound pretty wack in my opinion a lot of influences our name that man.	1.0

I mean, there are plenty of marriages as we're tables hate each other and manage to make Yeah. Yeah, I think I'd want that but in this situation, I think it would do that because I mean like if you think about it, like if you if you live with your parents your whole life, you're not going to hit anyone like oh, that's the point. You're not supposed to throw this part of the second one, too. You'll be alone your whole life you like ever get a girlfriend or anything.	-1.0
I wish I could remember I think he went I know he went a couple three times anyway in a bareback riding and then it only went twice in a bronx and the first year he went in the Bronx actually feeling Crawley one second and on him in The Eliminator pin that he wanted second that one round that one night and then then he went last this last night and 18, but he went and teen again, but then it came out that and was Zeke's arson and I think of zika gone anyway, and I didn't even got in flank and they jumped off I think and got to reroute a river. But but he so it came out backwards. And so it was kind of a mess that you're in 17 and then they didn't he didn't go back and this year and 18. He still box really? Well, I'm not I'm I'm not trying to say that, you know, like he's killed us really really hard. He just didn't go last year in you guys know how that goes some years. They need they need more of one kind and another and you know, this is how it goes. He just didn't get chosen last year, but he still as good as he was these this these people I'm going to mention here their long ways from you, but you probably you may you may know this the answer to what I'm going to say to correct me but to go with what you're saying Thor and some good friends of mine that live over there by you the the gays that horse is salt. They he went to the finals of bunching in the bareback riding and I'd never seen him in the bronc Ridin till this year. Did he go in the bronc riding him this year to the final? You know II could look but I don't recall seeing assault there, but I know him he's that Buckskin gilding. You're like, he's a good horse. Yeah, I don't know I could you know what I can look real quick cuz I think I have the NFR left right here in the go in the old. I remember seeing them. They took him to I think it was luck in in in the Bronx grab your maybe Amarillo and I was I had to watch that video a couple of times thinking is that the Assault that I think it is. Yeah, yeah, and and and and he's probably the same the same. Same scenario as I was talking about with Capone, you know, he's been a good bear back for a long time. But if they start covering a little ground and stuff.	-1.0

It seems like he built a really great product and can totally see retailers using a I just want to understand is this a 10 million hundred million billion 10 billion dollar Marty six billion dollar market. So, how do you so let me tell you how I would think about Market size images you say you're going after the Middle Market right 10 million 250 million hundred ten million 100 million in Revenue. I think about Market size is how many retailers exist in that sort of bucket. How many of them don't have an A. Nap and what's your sort of annual price per retailer really backing through to the market? I just worry that we're going after a nice hundred million dollar market but not a ten billion dollar market, excellent. So the total addressable addressable Market our addressable Market is 6 as 36 billion dollars currently right now, but you and that's yeah, you can't think you can't think of it as total retail Stan you got to think about it as what Revenue can we get from our Target? But he said that their issues billion years being spent by these retailers on mobile. If you look you're not going to get right you're gonna we're gonna work.	-1.0

We're not going to be happy Indians fans Indians for an office to I would venture to say that that's probably the takeaway that they have if they want to go draft day. They put a note in their pocket and it says Gavin Lux or nothing walk away and so I I have a certain faith in their ability in these negotiations to be able to walk away because we've seen in the past they They stick to their guns on this this sort of thing. They very rarely will meet you too far in the middle. They'll make trades. They think are fair and I don't know if they're necessarily trying to go out there and and Rob anybody but they have in their mind what they think is fair value in return for their guys. And if you're not willing to match it unless it's a situation where they're losing the player at the end of the year or the player doesn't really factor into their plans. They're prepared to just say no. Thanks and keeping Francisco. Lindor is one hell of a Secondary prize and I could argue is probably the first prize but as you've laid out before you've written we've discussed in this podcast the last week. If you do hold on to them, then you better you better make that worth it. You need to make that move count for something because once once you pass this winner and you the season starts to me, it's like a car driving on a brand new car driving off the lot the minute it does that the value has declined a bunch and lens or anything. Your cars, no kidding the luck. I have and Lindor is a I mean you're already starting with the value that is through the roof. So even if you're treating him for one year, you would give back something useful, but you're not going to get back. Somebody's top prospect like Gavin Lux, that's not happening. If you trade him. I think if you go through the end of this offseason and you hold on to him you can wave goodbye to anyone getting anyone close to that level.	-1.0
I would only put them on if I decided to run which I haven't been into running in a long time, but there's always a chance I could decide to start to take up running so I don't want to get rid of them, but I'm tired of seeing those in my drawer taking up space.	-1.0

Yea, you know that good made this or who wrote who made this? There's like even just today we're looking for something and and as I was like owner who wrote this is a trailer just came out today. I'm like, I wonder who wrote this for a morbius. Okay. He said yeah, it doesn't look very good. But I was curious who wrote it and I went to it and found out that the writer also did the kings of Egypt so I'm pretty sure my feelings about that movie or Justified. I love that movie but is so dumb anyway, so okay in terms of a plan. Yeah. I didn't have one and immediately but as I got a little bit older and start to realize as I started getting to the age where I needed to have a plan being you know, 17 18 years old. I am I going to college am I what am I doing? I like I had I had come to the decision that I wanted to go to film school. But at the same time like I didn't really feel comfortable like trying to ask my parents to help pay to send me to art school. I'm not it for when I'm not even sure that they would have liked agreed to that. You know, I think my dad's a pretty practical person. You probably have been like like well if you're gonna go to you know School Going to pay for it. We want to make sure it's something we can get a return on the investment for which makes sense. But my parents are also very they've always been very supportive of all the creative things I wanted to do when I was a place to play guitar might like my dad. He'll buy me like this. Nice big Marshall Half Stack and let you know it's always very supportive of this stuff. So that's just conjecture on my part. Is that how he would have felt about it? But good now you need to support especially in a different type of you know, you weren't doing sports and things like that.	1.0
That's the beauty of this year's draft. However, I do think the Packers are actually pretty much enamored with one specific. Pacific player much like gudykunst says he was last year with Jai you are Alexander. I think that guy could be Noah Fant this year and I think 12 might be just a bit Rich for Noah Fant. If we're being quite honest, I would like to see him taken in the late teens early 20s, if possible. I think that that kind of meets the place where we could see a run on tight ends based off some of the other teams needs and value fits and stuff like that. No offense would be a dynamic player and a dynamic I did. Into this Packers offense and not to take away from TJ Hawkinson, but I think no offense. It's just Far and Away a better athlete even though the relative at the relative Athletic score would indicate. Otherwise, I just think that fan is going to provide more dynamic system from the tight end position than Hawkinson will I think fans are very capable blocker not as not as bad as he's given credit for he definitely has some work to do in the area, but I think he could be a very serviceable blocker moving forward and I think that given that that quality and that characteristic I think that he's going to be heads above TJ Hawkinson career-wise.	1.0
Brett side got that. And that's cool. Look a little like five minute naps. Yeah, I went to a daycare one time and they had not time for like there's like a certain age and down that they did for all the random kids and I wasn't about it last week of last week over to watch the children and I could never sleep like this way to sketch now, I wasn't out of fucking sleep in some random ass for room.	-1.0

Well if we're just one kneel down going into the last 20 minutes you feel like we've got a chance of getting at least a point. We got better and better don't music. Yeah.	1.0
Like I'm I'm I guess I'm headed to names and then Use or it sounds familiar than the with the other back so they won't allow that to use it. I think if the name is cool, they would keep it from this stuff and then we'll just say you cannot use that name because it's really freaking hard just like every time I've came up come up with the name. I'll going to search it there if it's already taken and it's all always.	-1.0

But I think these a lot of these dreamers are just like very talented and they can't Point their finger on what that Talent is, but they have it, you know, they have whatever it could but I mean if they did it themselves, like what if you were their friend you might know more about them than the viewers do sure is like a might just kind of just like you want to pull the Veil Down if you were that streamer. It weird when you even have that conversation with people in the middle of your highly entertaining stream. It doesn't make sense. Hey, this is why we love having that conversation.	1.0

It seems nine people be crazy and you know back to bring them up with naloxone like, you know, if you have the means as a responder with like a bag valve mask and oxygen no freeze for them. Give them that oxygen concentration. That's just going to help them come up so much nice. Afterwards where we're getting those fights is we're rolling up on scene and people are hammering with naloxone prior to our arrival, but they're not doing in ventilating then we start ventilating then we give them a little bit more logs on and then they come up from the quickly right? It's probably because they've already got a pile of Narcan in them, but then there are hypoxic and then we're battling that so they're just confused.	-1.0

But if they if they leave and they go back to a new currency say the new drachma or whatever. It might be. There's no provision for that. Ultimately. We know they just create a new currency. Then that currency presumably would begin its life extremely weak. And that would that would have happened. If I sit in a similar way to the Asian financial crisis the late 90s where The currencies were pegged to the u.s. Dollar but not actually formed as part of a union as we Euro. So what we saw there is a model was the economy's did badly and that caused the pegs to go and then we saw this period of a complete collapse in the currency which made it unbelievably valuable to go and invest in country in companies there and and to visit of course you could stories of Tenten Pounds in Thailand, but it lasted you'd like for two weeks and then then it all settles down and it all recovers and look at Asia now, it's a Powerhouse.

Let's bring it out there and well, I'm I'm really guilty of like sharing memes all in like inspirational quotes and things like that on Instagram all the time talking about you anxiety and self-care and you know how you can manage it and sure that sounds nice and fluffy, but not all the time. Can we manage it with memes and coffee? And taking a bubble bath. So right which I mean it all helps but yeah, sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah, we'll see so so I know Audrey and I have spoken obviously beforehand about our previous experiences with anxiety and we have both in in overtime bin both diagnosed with a clinically diagnosed with anxiety. So I thought what we do first is kind of tell our like a briefly tell our story about how the It impacted us and then kind of what we're doing with it now and then maybe talk about some ideas of how we can other than a bubble bath how we can kind of help to relieve some of that anxiety when we're having those stressful days.

So welcome to the Green Bay Packers daylan machen that a wrap up the six-man draft class for the smartdraft simulation from a draft Network here for 2019 notable players afterwards to the underground forward. Jajuan Johnson to the Browns David long to the Vikings sudden Smith to the Titans Antoine Wesley to the Eagles Darius Slayton to Denver white rate of the Rams. Will Grier going to the Patriots to they maybe get another backup quarterback that could be trade bait in four years. Titus Howard to the Falcons final pick of this for round mock was Michael Jackson from Miami over to Philadelphia. So if there are no trays and in the dream scenario, this would be how the Packers would Shape Up according to what Tyler and I have decided to do Brian Burns goes to 12 and no offense goes at 30 Debo Samuel at 44 one Thornhill at 75 Connor McGovern and 114 and daylan Mac at 118 if That were to be the case and if all these pics were to end up in Green Bay, I would be Beyond ecstatic. I would not sleep very well.

So you say something funny and then it beeps? He says something funny on command. We're testing it out fucking will be. So today mean Isabelle going to be talking about depression Isabel's my cyst and we both have depression. So that's why we're talking about it today both think we can offer some advice and just share our experiences with it. A lot of people say that they have depression when they don't and they're just sad so there's like a difference between being depressed and just sad so I'm going to read the DSM-5 criteria, so It says the individual must be experiencing 5 or more of these symptoms during a two-week period and they are depressed mood most of the day nearly everyday markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement that eager loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day recurrent thoughts of death recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. Rude, yeah, rude, they are so rude. That is so rude. Yeah. Hit me where it hurts the most. Yeah. Yeah, so When did you kind of realize like you have that like, oh shit moment. Like I have depression it was with you. Actually we were in we're going to see our dad and Florida and you're just hanging out on the beach and I said, I was 12 I said hey. Even when you get in the car, do you sometimes like like not want to put your seatbelt on just like if you get in a car accident, so you'll die in the not have to wake up and you said no. Nope, I don't remember that at all. Wow. Yeah, so I realized that no one else around you want to get hit by a bus. Yeah, and like everyone has different like Degrees of depression so when I say have depression, I mean very recently after our father passed away. I got depressed but I wouldn't say like I've clinical depression all the time. Mmm. It was a very depressed period of my life. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself depressed. But as you would, you know, well, that's a big difference to like there's a normal scale of like grief that people experience but mine was passed that they're like, there's no right way to grieve. Yeah. But I think my grief turned into severe depression because it lasted for like a year and it became well, that's when it persists. It's that's what it's different. Yeah, but it was far too hard DSM-5. Yes, but it was triggered by something. So whereas yours was just like always kind of present your whole life. Yeah. I can look back and be like, yeah like yeah, we saw that I would always say like and as well as also bipolar Sorry by pulling impressive. Yeah. Yeah, so but I remember thinking when I was six like there's a good Isabel on a bad Isabel and we pretend that she had an evil twin named Bethany. Oh, yeah, let's Bethenny. Yeah. And so whenever like we'd be eating at the dinner table, Bethany would be looking at me with like these dagger eyes and I feel like I can't tell my mom the Bethany's here. Like I have to pretend it's Isabelle like yeah, I get so nervous. Like Bethenny would be in the card. Like I remember just being terrified of When Bethenny came out no one was having a good day. Yeah savagery. Yeah, it was savagery. But I think one thing people don't realize about depression is how much of your life that you miss out on and just completely blank on like Olivia has this whole memory. I don't have any memory of it at all. I didn't remember Bethany until she just said Bethenny right now and like I'm assuming that's the right name, but I don't Bethenny, but I don't have a memory of it. We would do it at summer camp to to like freak out the kids out. Hmm. So and I was so used to it. It was so normal for me. Yeah, but other people I'm sure thought we were like crazy. Yeah. Is the point I'm trying to make is that depression can take away periods of your life with leaving you with no memory almost like holes and associating kind of not associating you look back and you don't remember anything. Yeah, like literally have memories that people have your brain is empty. Yeah. That's very sad. Emptiness is a good word. I think but it really do be like that. So I really do be like that it really do. I think this is like so after my dad died, I remember one day I was going on a run and I usually love to run but this run was hard and then all of a sudden I just started like sobbing. And like it hit me like then that I wanted to kill myself and like that's what I all I could think about the whole run was how is going to kill myself when I got home? No when I got home, but like in the future like when I was going to do it all this stuff and I just told my mom right away. I was just like this is very abnormal for me. Like I got put on an antidepressant and it helped immediately almost But that was a phase of my life where if I am afraid to go off my antidepressants because like what if I do have depression now mmm, you know, and it's just the medicine just works. So well, you know and it's not like that for everyone that comes so lucky that like it was a period, you know, definitely Well medicine is hard because it it only works just to such an extent where you kind of had to put in the work to you know what I mean? Like it'll give you the tool in your toolbox exact. It's not the whole box. Yeah, definitely. So on top of it to the Press since it doesn't mean you can just take a pill like go about your day. You actually have to actively like tell your brain. Hey, dude, shut the fuck up. Yeah, you'll lot of things you don't need. Kill yourself you genuinely don't ya and sometimes it's like reminding yourself like all the good things you have which sounds really cheesy but that's actually helped me a lot just sitting on my bedroom floor. I'm being present and being great. Yeah and like Isabel like it's so good. Like she'll go outside with her crystals and like charger crystals and do some like stretching like she didn't need to do that before she does things for herself now, like go to like comedy nights and stuff, which I think is really awesome. And she's definitely like has come a long way. It's all comes down. Down to just being kind to yourself. You can't be angry at yourself for not making progress every single day. You're not going to make progress every single day might regress. Yeah, you're going to live with it for your whole life. So you have to be kind to yourself about it and you have to reassure yourself. Like you're not always going to be in this mood and just kind of today not every day is going to be exactly and just keep encouraging yourself and being nice to yourself and the nicer you already yourself the more that like guilt that comes with depression will go away. I think that's kind of also how I knew that I had depression was because I had All this guilt for know that's a big part of it. Yeah, and I was just like there was a point where I was like calling people and saying sorry for things that I didn't even need to say sorry for her because I just couldn't fathom why I was feeling so bad about myself. Yeah. That was like I did something wrong, you know, like these people hate me and I think that's another thing with depression is like it really is storts your view about you're like purpose and your place on this earth like you really do think no one loves you sometime so definitely, but you're not lovable, you know. Mmm. or that it would be better off or you wouldn't be affected and like something that I've had a hard time with is just like I always tell myself now like most things aren't the end of the world. Which is a good thing, but also like the world's going to keep going, you know, yeah, definitely and I think that's a thing that people with depression is just like why am I here? Like, they're very smart people that are depressed. Oh, yeah, definitely have a lot like most people have a higher IQ if they're depressed because they just are so aware of everything that's like going on in the dusty. It's not like when everything is thriving in the world depression rates go up like it's directly correlated with kind of the state of things. Yeah, because people Like we're affected by each other quietly gently genuinely are affected by each other. If you're having a bad day. I I consider myself an empath. I don't have a good day either, you know, like if people that I really love like our are sad like, I can't be happy. Yeah are genuinely happy. For me, I just think it's like I think a lot of the problem is like depression in this first world country when you have all these Comforts is like I literally have no reason to be depressed right now that makes it worse and it makes you make yourself feel guilty. Did you just sit on it? The guilt? The guilt is a really interesting thing. Like I remember being like Five and like putting away like my first tour was ever was like putting away dishes in the dishwasher and there were like big forks and little forks. And I was like, I don't want to separate the little forks from the big Force because like the baby force them on me for seem to be together and I felt like I was like the worst human ever for doing that. You know what I mean? Like I always even then I always needed to have a reason for why I was guilty. Yeah, I would I just felt guilty because I was always so angry. Yeah. Like anger is a secondary emotion, you know? Yeah, definitely. Another thing about being this angry in this cute. Is that when you get angry everyone around you goes? No, you just make me like five to give or take an inch. Yeah, so normally takes us seriously. Yeah, definitely. People laugh when I get mad. Oh, yeah. That's how I know like, okay well, but they're like all that chipmunks having a bad day. I know. Oh, yeah. I feel like there's a lot of stories. I have that about depression that like a lot of things where I'm just like normal quote-unquote like morals neurotypical people just like wouldn't think this way mmm, you know, but like what are some like misconceptions you think about depression that That don't have it. Kind of like Get wrong. I just think the number one thing is that People aren't kind enough to people with depression. They're not patient enough and they expect too much. So they don't view it as something that's seriously chemicals are incorrect in your brain that affects you every day. That is almost like a physical weight on you every day when you wake up. That's not what they do it as they just say like they think you can snap out of it, especially if you're high functioning especially for high functioning like I go to work every single day. I work six days a week and every day someone tells me you like you make my day all the time. You always make me smile, you know, because I'm such a high-functioning depressive and the other day. I said, you know, I am really struggling right now think I got to go see a new therapist or something and there's this almost they said, oh you have depression and I said, yeah and they said I would have never guessed the yeah you had depression because the way you carry yourself. Yeah, it's just but that tape but they don't understand how much effort that takes out of someone. And almost when people tell me that sometimes I'm like, thank you honestly, but also like doesn't have a look. It doesn't have a not always. Yeah, it does sometimes like oh you can't like look at somebody like they're having a bad day. But like eyes exactly why I think it's important to talk about it because you wouldn't expect certain people you wouldn't expect to be depressed and they jammed the happiest people like yeah are depressed like Robin Williams, for example, he was very very depressed and he was always making people laugh. He said something really good about depression, which I think like we need to hear it out. It was like it was something along the lines of yes depression is a crippling illness that is not 100% Like people aren't 100% in control of but I also do believe that if you are not thinking the right things actively eating the right things actively hoping actively loving yourself actively. Then you are not giving yourself a Fighting Chance. That's so true. You cannot just give yourself with who? There was a point at school and I think I tend to get more depressed when I'm stressed and it is depression because like there was a point where I could not get out of my bed for eight days. Yeah. It did not leave my apartment for eight days and all I ate was Oreos. Yeah, and that just perpetuated the cycle. Like if I had healthy food, you know, I probably would have just been invented my like right mind but I literally as well knew I was calling her like crying. I'm like, I was depressed like it was hard. Yeah, and it's hard for me because like we were saying earlier like Olivia wasn't always. This way it was always me so then me seeing the way that I've always been on Libya someone who always be this happy. It was really hard. It was really see ya because a lot of people give me that way too and I wasn't fake either. It was very genuine. So after my dad died, I went on antipsychotics just because I was I needed to be stabilized because I wasn't doing well. I had a lot of PTSD. Yeah, and I didn't laugh for four months and it was the scariest thing because I felt like I couldn't Make emotions. Yeah, I didn't have emotions and it was Yep, jarring yet and that's why when my I feel like my my mood is kind of getting getting really bad. I don't immediately jump the gun and say, okay, let's medicate. I kind of step back and wait it out and be patient with myself and be kind to myself. You can look hopeful for towards the future and then you'll find so much better like think about how you coped back then even versus now like definitely changing holes in walls now you don't do that anymore. Yeah. I know. I'm 90. I can still punch a good hole in the wall. Yeah, I don't do that anymore. Yeah, I just go to hardcore shows. Yeah, we're it so punch other people. Where's okay to hit people. Yeah, they wanted they literally want it. Yeah, it's gonna pay for it. And another thing with depression finding those Outlets that you can be that place where you can see angry at. Yeah, there's always some anger like late and anger. You never really know about. Yeah, but that that bitching third grade Duty told if you're angry that I farted. Yeah when it was her, yeah. Yeah, that would make me angry still. Yeah. Yeah, but like I'm not saying you need to go but all your friends go to all your friends talk about how sad or angry you are, but I personally like my best friend. We love ranting to each other above pick things that make us angry to friend you leave that person to we're not each other's therapist, but it sounds fuck I fighting to fucking go off. You know what I mean? Like she's there to listen and she thinks it's funny. You know what I yeah, like again when I'm small but I'm angry like Funny regardless, yeah, so having that person that you guys kind of both enjoy and you feed off each others, like fuck this and you kind of just get that out for today Twitter was invented. That's why Twitter was invented. Yeah, honestly, like it's so good for like my depression because I'm just psyched about Twitter. Yeah. I heard about Twitter. My favorite thing about Twitter is when the mainstream media goes Okay, we're going to put together this story. For example Epstein yet committed suicide. Hope it works. They sends it out immediately Twitter. Oh how motherfucking convenient a billionaire with tons of dirt commit suicide. So K and it just immediately air quotes immediately on Twitter everyone blew up and was like, yeah. No and that's why I love Twitter. I love Twitter and it's a conglomerate a fucking Pete. I love those like memes that go viral. It's just like my depression my eating disorder my anxiety like all meeting up and it's like all those people doing the damn. Yeah, I love that like then it yeah, I mean, I think another another misconception that depressed people or mentally ill people have is mentally ill people have is that they're in this alone like no one understands what they're going through. That's not the fucking case. There are literally millions of people that feel actually exactly the way that you do and I'm sure neither of you can describe that feeling because it's okay and that's why No one thinks that anyone feels like them. Yes, but you have to communicate and be like no dude. I feel big sad sometimes to fix a big sad and that's okay. You know, I think another moment where I realized I had depression was where I was like laying down in bed with my friend and he was trying to tell me that like there was like more to life than like than what I was seeing and he was like people love you like your friends just all came over and you like made them all breakfast and like all the stuff and I was like, no one loves me like yeah, I'm like unlovable and I was crying and I didn't want anyone like like nothing anyone said could change the fact that I thought no one loved me. Yeah. Yep, or did I was like, there's nothing you can say and he was just like so sad like he was crying. Yeah, and I was like, why are you upset and he was like cuz I care about you and I was like, I don't know what yeah. Yeah, but once one time when I realized I was not in a good spot was when you my boyfriend, we're going to Chick-fil-A and big complex of just like people going and shopping and shit and there was like a really happy family of like a mom and a dad. Three kids. They're all like gigglin the kid was holding the mom's hand. I just gestured out the window and loudly said I don't want to see that. Really? Yeah, and then there was like Isabel, that's a perfectly Pleasant situation.	-1.0
Well, yes within a few moments. I had an idea who I should really be speaking to because it seemed evident that you know, and it's like a lot of pitches to you know, you probably heard when speaking with other entrepreneurs that we've pitched hundreds of times to Angel Investors or VCS and you know, the ones that get it and you want, you know, the ones that don't and there's very little that you can do.	0.0
Whoa. The first one was the funniest.	1.0
What do you do and it's actually what he's been doing. He's looked at the world. And for example, he he said right there are children dying in Africa because they can't get clean water. I'm going to solve this problem and he writes to the universities in America gets the greatest Minds together funds a few projects which are completely crazy and last week we had on the podcast a guy called Alan Steel who recommended a book called Loom shots, which is about crazy ideas that can change the world and this all ties in with what exactly what he was doing at what he's doing and and he solved the problem. He's created this sanitation system that is just completely revolutionary and I don't want to spoil it for you for other people are going to watch it, but it's exactly what you just said. He's gone out there. He's looked at problems and he said right I'm going to use my money. I'm going to use my brain and I'm going to fix it and It's changed my opinion of him completely. I've heard a lot of respect for him now, but that this book also I think is is is going to be one that I'm going to read because it's it sounds like it's saying the same thing so Tim, what do you have? Well first you have to endure sceeto's selection because Man's Search for meaning is the most inspiring book I've ever read and it's extremely extremely affecting in every sense of the word. So to go from the sublime to the Nicholas I'm gonna go for well, I'm here too because there's a connection between them. The first is Bohemian Rhapsody. And so I saw recently always sort of thought. Yeah Freddie Mercury. Yeah higher pick which is nothing really very special but it's very entertaining. Yes, hugely crowd-pleasing entertainment. The critics hated it the good excited it while it's great. It's quite it's eminently watchable and for anyone of a certain age, I mean queen was just all over the 70s and most of the a 80s now I never bought the queen record, but but you have to admit they they gave good rock. Oh definitely. I was very lucky to go to all the early Queen concerts. I really yeah, you are privileged. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I just I would go to other gigs that my friends were talking about and I would say God this is this is rubbish, you know, because I'm my first few get wise to go to the Marquee Club in London and say a lot of small bands which were great. But my first Stadium gig was a queen gig so I was like, Let me spoil on the Waterworks tool and when it came to Live Aid I wasn't surprised I was like the other band States quote great and some other bands were great. But you know, I'd like Sade playing bass line for 10 minutes before they actually got into their song Along Comes Queen and just like blows everyone knows everyone knows everyone else away in that I knew that this is what they would do because I'd seen them before the other. The other one is another Netflix production called the spy with Sacha Baron. Aaron Cohen, I don't know if you know the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen Dido. He has it Borat and yeah things but this is as far as I'm aware his first serious acting role. There is a major first. It's a very good film. It's a series of day. I think it's a six part series on Netflix very very the true life story of a Israeli spy who infiltrated the the top level of the Syrian government quite incredible true life story, but Sacha Baron Cohen is outstandingly good in this and the reason I mention the connections because I believe Sacha Baron Cohen was originally lined up to play for any Mercury. Yes. He was yes, he's I think he's brilliant the Common Thread here because we've talked about this a bit in the past is it seems easier much easier for good Comics to become good serious dramatic actors either way around I believe so I'd interesting. I mean, I think it's much harder to do what he's done in the past, you know his comedic work than and I I wouldn't be surprised if his acting is absolutely outstanding, but but Guido look, thank you so much for your time, and there's something	1.0

I've interviewed a few people will keep it completely Anonymous but people with good marriages and talk a little more about boundaries and dating people, you know, Kristen I when we look back and we say we look back at our dating time. It's very often that will say man. I'm so glad we you know, I'm so glad we did that. I'm so glad we had that boundary what we look back and Man, if we could do it over we would do this a little bit differently. So I've sat down with a couple people and ask them questions and going to give you some feedback of boundaries and dating things to do things that were the right thing to do before marriage, maybe some things to do differently and break some things down here. So one of the couples that I spoke to you know, a lot of them actually came out to be the same thing and I think overall the the main voice as a Christian and and people called to the ministry. Yeah, but even just in general you're called to something as a child of God. You have a call on your life. It may be a Ministry calling. It may be a call to business. It may be whatever it is. But one of the main things that everyone repeated over and over Is We I made sure to speak the vision to be very clear and plain about speaking the vision that God has for my life and I thought it's interesting because the next question that you know in mind when I heard that was is it'd be pretty safe to say that you'd To have a vision for your life before you should be getting married. You know, I think it's interesting and Adam and Eve in the garden that God gave him a work to do first. And so God gave him this job. He named all the animals. He was to attend he knew exactly what God had sent him to do and then God gave him a wife you hear preachers all the story is if you don't have a job, you shouldn't be trying to get married. Yeah, just saying if you ain't got a job. You don't need a wife. What do you boo? What is she supposed to be a helpmeet? What is she helping with you? Trying to she coming in to do your dish? This is what she'd what's happening. And you kind of get it to do your laundry. He supposed to be a helper for the mission. You know, I think that's where people get off. One of the things that the one of the couple said is, which is awesome. You just said the first couple he said, you know, we I'm I made it a purpose. I look forward to my life as a life as a married couple and we want to serve God full out and I made it a purpose to do those things while we were dating. So serving the lord he We purposely plugged in to church more we served. He said we would go Soul winning together. He said I wanted he said the pace that we were running while we were dating is the pace that we were running now and he said something interesting and this may rub people the wrong way, but he said we weren't always minded just on on dating. He said I wasn't so dating minded. He said I was Kingdom. He didn't say Kingdom on it, but that's basically what it's saying. He said I was I set my eyes on doing the things that I was doing by myself before the relationship and then I wanted to be doing once we were married. Read so they were winning Souls together. He said I wasn't we weren't always just watching movies together and going on dates and going to the beach. He said it's not even things that are wrong. He's like, it's just things that are carnal. He's like you're in a people get in a carnal relaxed mode, but you need to be in a place of like going after the things of God and so you can tell in the marriage. I mean, they're having a great impact. They're called to the mission field but doing the things together that they wanted to do with their life when you look at the call of God on your life. What is that? Look, like is it is it winning Souls, if you're if you're a Christian, we're going to talk about that in a later podcast, but you're called the wind soul is your relationship should have that included in it. It should be something that you shouldn't be embarrassed to share the gospel with somebody if you're with your girlfriend if that should be a red flag if you're with your girlfriend or boyfriend and you have to tone down the things of God. You're not in the right relationship where you have one of those around them.	-1.0

Before we continue I want to take a quick break to tell you about anchor anchor is honestly the easiest way to make a podcast for starters it's free, which doesn't get any better than that. Second of all, they have a lot of tools that allow you to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or computer the best part in my mind. Is that anchor also helps you distribute your podcast, so I don't have to go and create an account with Spotify. Apple podcast Google pod. Cast overcast can't even list all the places that get the pancake is played from simply because I don't have to worry about it. Anchor does it for me? If starting a podcast is something you're interested in download the free anchor app or go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started not anchor.com anchored dot f m now back to our episode. Hi coaches, this is Whitney with get the pancake a podcast for volleyball coaches today. I have a special treat for you. A lot of you have been requesting longer podcast episodes. And so today I thought I would surprise you with a longer episode and combine it with a special reading of a chapter from my book, which is coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season. Now, this book just recently came out in a paperback edition, and I'm super excited that so many of you have already gone on to Amazon to get your copy. I wrote this book in 2016. It has been available as an e-book. I know a lot of you were really waiting and holding out for that paperback copy. I'm the same way. I like to have my book in front of me instead of on a screen but for whatever reason it was a challenge to get that out when I wanted it, but it is finally ready. So after I read this chapter to you if you are interested in getting the full version it is available again on amazon.com the chapter that I'm going to be reading today is chapter. For the beginning of the season now, you may be thinking the beginning of the Season that sounds like it should be chapter one. But as you read this book, you'll realize that there's a lot more to coaching than just stepping onto the core and running practice and playing games again. This is going to be a pretty long podcast. I'm really excited to share this chapter with you. I hope it gives you some good direction and gets you excited for your next season of volleyball whether that's your And sixth or even first season, I hope you get pretty pumped. So let's go ahead and jump into the chapter. Chapter 4 beginning of the season from coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season written by Whitney Bartok. You may be thinking finally we get to practice the answer is yes, and no, of course you get to practice once the season starts but there are still a few administrative tasks which need to be completed.	1.0

it turns out that the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear tests actually work tests. They were trying to kill something and you ever heard of a ship called the USS Lawton that was there during that time. Well, neither did I and out of 1,000 young men on that ship one man. William Randall was the only Survivor they told his family. She was sunk in a battle. But Randall says he knows what he saw and in his words. It had no conscience. No reasoning just destroy and he spent the last 30 years trying to prove the truth of what he learned. Day and what he learned is what you guys are about to learn Guyz this planet doesn't belong to us ancient species only this Earth long before Mankind and if we keep our heads buried in the sand any longer, they will take it back. There's this agency which goes by the name of Monarch in a specializes in the hunt for massive unidentified terrestrial organisms. And today it is a today's episode is on just one of them the skull crawler. The information I got is from the King Kong Wiki and from the Monarch files. Here we go. Little is known about the origins of this voracious Predator. Although its evolutionary purpose is it is abundantly clear the skull crawler exists to devour destroy and dominate Subterranean a nature and burrowing up through through the geologically unstable. Steve leant across Skull Island. It is as though the skull crawler climbed up out of hell itself, and this terrifying Serpentine animal is a hyper for a creature with such a hyper a generalized metabolism that it exists in And of course instead of starvation and just as a shark must keep swimming to survive the the skull crawler must keep feeding dislocate dislocating its own jawbone's so to maximize its ability to swallow anything that crosses its path and within that gaping cavernous small exists along Whiplash tongue in which the creature uses to ensnare and constrict its prey.	0.0
Yeah, but the only thing that we did miss out on in a naughty sent me this in actually reminded me of it is originally if they had gotten a season 7 Scott was supposed to pass off somehow. I don't know what the logic behind it is, but he was supposed to pass off his Alpha to Liam so that Liam could take care of Beacon Hills while he was at school. And so I'm like does that He's not an alpha anymore. Like he's just gonna give it up. You know, it's just so crazy. But then Alex was going to be the new Teen Wolf and then they were going to you know, do this whole 2.0 thing and I remember Jeff talking about that. And so I'm like if the aunties knew that Scott wasn't the office and he gave it to a white boy I would die and I wanted to happen. It's Canon as far as I'm concerned.	0.0

They don't look like they have the correct weight. Like I know they might be on another planet may be different gravity. But do you know what I'm talking about?

And I wanted to put yeah, but then they'll be like what a good bunch of copycats don't like.	1.0
Do you have any input there it to me when it comes to the safeties. It depends on what you want with them. Do you want the kind of steady solid all-around player? Beyonce Thompson who who's in who's just kind of good player, but he's more around it or do you want the ball skills of Thornhill former Corner who is really really strong and coverage and he's a guy who's going to create turnovers for you guys. That's the biggest thing for me with the receivers Hollywood Brown does worry me with an injury and he's also very very small and slight so I wonder if that could be a recurring thing Deebo Samuel would be my choice because as if I was going to go receiver because his route running is so Dynamic and I ever You came at the Senior Bowl. He was absolutely making top-flight corners of foolish out there. And and I think he's a guy who stuck drop because he didn't have the greatest year at South Carolina, but he's another solid player for so for me to be down between Samuel and Thornhill, but I'll defer to you if you want you to be one of those okay with you lean toward.	-1.0
But it looks like it's yeah downstairs and you go down there like playing beautifully and you're like, oh my God, I hate you. I want to have more play dates.	-1.0

No, I agree. I had as much as I like do the young receivers like slate and Boykin and even Wesley little bit the Packers young receivers. I want to see what they can do this year. And we've already taken Debo Samuel off the board. So I think another you offensive lines the way to go. They do need to fortify it. McGovern's he's going to be a steady player. I think he's going to be a solid player for a long time. And I think that you'd and plus drafting a pure interior offensive linemen will help because years past we've always have two tackles and shifted him in. I think drafting a guy who's been a guard before gives him a little bit of that extra Edge when they come into camp and let you learn the intricacies right away. And so yeah, let's make Connor McGovern The Pick and so just a few more pics is till we get to our gift from the Washington Redskins at pick 118 and there goes miles Boykin right off the bat. So the three picks between McGovern and the current one Justin Hollins from Oregon goes to the Panthers miles Boykin to the Dolphins again because they take everyone that we want and Joe. Jackson of Miami goes to the Falcons So now top guys on the board Josh all over still out there from San Jose State. Jajuan Johnson from Miami Darius. Slaton Antoine Wesley. Treyvion Williams, Jacoby Myers Dennis daily Marquis Blair from Utah Ronnie Anderson from Oklahoma and Demarcus Lodge from Mississippi are the top guys on the board will further down the Border guys, like will Grier Terry Godwin Titus Howard Jared Stidham still on the board a little bit further down house Gaskins still down there as well, but There's still some good names out. There is still some good prospects for pick 118.	1.0

No, not like a single chocolate chip, but that's another thing about intuitive eating is that a lot of people like kind of swing back and forth from these extremes of being really strict with their diet and then kind of saying like fuck it and just I broke the diet. I'm gonna go all out and eat all my favorite things and maybe eat more of them than I really want to but it's that mentality of going between extremes that actually creates a lot of Shame and guilt around food rather than just like mop, you know, like enjoy All of the different types of foods you're craving in in smaller doses are in moderation and legalizing them in your day-to-day life. So you don't feel the need to like eat the gallon of ice cream. You can just have you know a serving at a time.	1.0

I wanted to stay out of this because how TI raises his family ate my concern and it ain't my business. However, I am absolutely a here for a larger conversation about how girls and women's bodies are constantly being policed. Now, I will always be bothered by the fact that we are so consumed and fixated on the sexual behavior and the bodies of girls and women and I mean by both men and women case in point how many times have you heard men and some women but mostly men say they don't want a girl because then they have to worry about her getting pregnant or they don't want a girl because they don't want to think about all the boys and men trying to have sex with her and someday it will It their attitude is based off their own personal experience. They knew there was a time when they weren't shit, so they didn't want their own daughter exposed to some Reincarnation of their ancient Indus. So before a girl is even born before she even gets here people already policing her body. Now we have to deal with that our entire lives as women. Not just for my fathers brothers or Uncle's women can be just as guilty I often say this when discussing racism and racial oppression. Ian the real unfairness of dealing with those issues is that the burden and responsibility to solve the problem is placed squarely on the people most victimized by it. So when we have these conversations about rape and sexual assault the conversation is solely centered around women and what we need to do to protect ourselves. There's certainly a place for that but who is having conversations with young boys and men about consent about respect about keeping their hands to themselves if you don't want some asshole boy dish. Affecting your daughter then use that same energy with boys that you have when you want to police girls and women about their bodies instead of telling boys and men and run through as many girls and women as possible. If you want girls and women to be treated better. If you want us to be respected. It's simple raise better men stay on bothered.

And yeah, I just like called her out. and was like hey, why do you believe that like, do you know that I'm a person and you're saying that to me on the internet and that's like actually such a terrible thing to say to somebody and a lot of them apologize because it's not about me convincing them that my way of thinking is right, but it's more about the more defensive you are and lieu of actually being an empath and listening and like allowing people to On their own Journeys with patience and love instead of always trying to like get everyone onto your team. The more effective you are just as a human being in general, but especially as a Christian, I don't understand what church is telling people that's emboldening them to go online screaming about someone else going to hell like that's yeah. Jesus was not walking around Jerusalem screaming about hell. Yeah, so I'm like, where where did you guys even get that from and what?

I would describe it as I want to say lifestyle, even though I don't love that term. It's just a new mentality or a new approach to being in your body, you know, so I have also seen as intuitive eating has become friend here, like people advocating intuitive eating as like the diet where you don't diet and that's so counterproductive to the point of being because it's not a diet and in fact, you cannot practice intuitive eating while also trying to control or intentionally lose weight because as long as you're doing that as long as you are if you can't do it with Weight Watchers, for example, no, Like you like even though they say with Weight Watchers, you could eat whatever you want, but I'll keep ya as long as you're following externalized rules about what you should be eating and tracking your numbers and and having fear around going past a certain point. You'll never be able to actually tune into your body to tell you how much food you really need to feel satisfied. So intuitive eating separates out weight from your health and and really believe that you can be Healthy and you can focus on just practicing Health behaviors without feeling the need to control your weight and that your weight actually is not indicative of your health status.	-1.0

You know, I did I joined the Air Force at 17 and I ended up spending about five years in the military honestly because I knew at the other end of that I'd be able to afford to go to film school.

Want to lose 10 pounds or more for most people it's toning losing body fat. Just being yeah, I would say that like more body composition wanting to and you know, 80% of all clientele are females. And so if you think about after pregnancy, if you think about how females invest in their lashes their nails their plastic surgery everything their hair, you know, they invest in their bodies and so but with males is a little different because you know, we go through Sports we have friends that we hang out with that we all gym and like Sigmund Freud said it like most males the reason why we exercise So it's sex-related. So he says like the reason why people want to drive fast cars are the reason why they want to buy nice shoes of the reason why they want to dress a certain way is because they want to attract other people. It's like something called pheromones. So yeah, it's very very interesting. So he says a lot of the decisions that we actually make the color that we want the body that we want or the kind of house or car or job. You know, there is kind of like sex-based kind of Interest Is pretty interesting, you know, but anyway back to Just Fitness and itself being a trainer for the past four years has saved my life it gave me a sense of purpose and I've dealt with a lot of drug addiction to the past and also dealt with you know, just finding my own security and life but personal training kind of just fell into my lap and it allowed me to do something greater than myself. So it was nice and Growing up are going to college you didn't study to be a nosy right now. I wanted to do a first, you know, I wanted to be a doctor but I didn't want to be a doctor. It was something that my parents wanted me to do. Yeah, you know and then as I started realizing what I really wanted to do, I just kind of went with my own instincts. There's that Jim Carrey thing that he said where ya know you can either live your life doing something that you kind of like doing and fail at that. Or you can live your life and do something that you love right and fail at that like at least go out with doing something that you love because you know, he talked about his dad and his dad just you know wasn't really living happy lives. Thanks for trying to find, you know purpose like what really drives you what gives you fulfillment in life. It's really just about service. It's about what you're doing for other people. That's what gives you like the most Joy before you're doing Fitness.	1.0

I've got talked about this last but I think it's actually it's a good segue since you mentioned the day or so and Tommy Boy situation. Now this new just came today, but the original story from a few weeks ago our boy Kanye West has been in a legal battle with Rockefeller and Emi who has been signed with since 2003 Kanye West with the Timothy to gain his ownership of his music and receive unpaid royalties, but now the news has come around that's mr. Kanye West has sold his soul and you know, I mentioned that he was with the Amana 2003 but his contract got extended in 2010, but according to this contract and I'm going to read what it says here and I can read the whole thing, but But verbatim it says at no time during the term. Will you seek to retire as a songwriter recording artist or producer or take any extended Hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing your musical career and the same basic manner issue in for sued such career to date. So what that means is that if Kanye loses his battle this man still can't retire like that's that's just wild this is wild. After all it is your trying to get ownership of your music Emi Rockefeller on it. You're trying to get unpaid royalties and they like well, okay no matter what happens. You can't retire bread according to this contract. So it's just another one of those situations where you're not reading fully what's going on or you are reading and you're just willingly signing over everything that you own and everything that you work for. These companies are shady man. And it just it sucks. I know that we made for The Kanye Kanye gun some wild stuff especially last year alone, but I don't want to hear this from anybody. I don't want to hear anybody trying to fight to get ownership of their music and then end up being a Slave at the end of the day because of some loophole or something that the artist did not look at before they actually signed a contract or signed the extension. So, how do you feel about this whole situation with Kanye?	-1.0

No, so I know not the only one but Sis got a drinking ticket in high school. You did what I told you this. I don't think so. Yeah, I did there was like a couple people at my school that did and of course I was one of them like are you surprised? Are you I mean, no, so I was at this kids graduation party. I was like a junior. This kid was a senior. He had like a big party for his graduation and everyone was drinking. I wasn't the only one and a lot of I a lot of Vermont parties. I remember being in high school and cops coming to all of our parties. Is that just like a Vermont thing or did that happen to you too? It happened in college, but This happened in high school for us like in the middle of the woods in high school. Like I can only think of one time cops came and I'm trying to think of like what I did like it wasn't it wasn't anything that like wasn't handled like we were outside and they basically were like stop drinking like we have a ghoul can annoy. It was like a noise complaint like a neighbor called and said it was too loud. But like they never checked if anybody was drinking know there was like multiple parties. I got breathalyzed at in high school. Seriously. Yeah, that did not happen to me. I know that was like a thing and people like me that's why I like Hitler. It sounds bad that like not a drinking ticket underage. Whatever whatever but like it was so common. Like it happened to like a handful of people. I know not everybody but I happen to be one of them are just special. I am special help. So how I got the drinking ticket it was A friend's graduation party, he was a senior and he you know graduating high school. He had a big party a bunch of people from different ages went like this is like a pretty big. I remember it being a lot of people there and the cops show up and everybody like this is such a typical like Vermont thing. I know you all can relate like we just like all run in the woods like this was like the thing for Grant away. Oh my God, this was like a thing. Like we all just ran like ran into the woods. We slept into the abyss like and I was just like following somebody but like sis was so drunk. She couldn't like keep up solo me and like my like, I don't even know I was like trying to keep up like trying to hang beer in my hands like running. I'm wrong. I was like I got this I was like I got this And then of course, of course it was like I can't remember who I was with. I think I was like with some guy but we got caught and the cop was like come this way with me and you know, I was always taught that if a cop, you know catches you running you, don't try to fight it you just go along you go with him you apologize and that's what I did. So we went with him was like a group of like five kids and like we were the only girl So yeah, Jesus.	-1.0

So we don't have to be as specific we can kind of do this and we can kind of do that we can kind of do this. So, I think that was kind of her point and I did kind of agree with that because it was it was like there was an alien, baby. Baby that you could touch but then there were moons and stuff. And then there I don't know. It did seem a little it didn't seem as cohesive as the hive which I know we will get into and I have notes about it, but I liked it and I agree.

They would agree that clearly. I mean we have too much of going lately too much of government intervention everywhere. The results are very bad. If you look at it from the point of view of the actual performance of the system to which they to be by academic. Education that economic growth income and wealth distribution as as far as the economy is concerned all these they always screw up right? So you need less of this the problem if you want to turn it back is that it's really it's It's much more difficult than adding a little bit of it to the existing system existing system. So if you have the current system and you have it more government involvement in education, so on a little more that's not a big shake-up for the whole system. It just makes it paralyzed that it a little bit more if you increase taxes a little bit more that's not a big shake-up. So it just makes it marginally more difficult unless you try to turn. Back, we got a problem, especially in the economy. We got a big problem because the economy is so fragile because it is sort of become a Dead junkie but under the influence of monetary interventions in particular. So if you scale back a little bit of this Q fragile eyes and migrate the bankruptcy of certain elements of the economy at this might entail snowboarding effects that have the potential of going on. On all the rest of the economy with that so it's not easy to go. The other direction of I tend to think that as the rule you should think big as you guys are doing apparently because you're raising a big question and you should not be afraid of considering a complete overhaul just cutting a bit from under-20 something like this. I mean certainly the case of money and government spending in the economy. It's on this concert. I think that's definitely a really realistic option.	-1.0
It's just about it's about until it's just about Gathering as much as you possibly can you're Under One Roof. You can't leave your sweet or else you get swarmed by crazy people in the lobby. And so you just sit up there and you talk about different scenarios with your fellow front office members and you You talk to other teams and see what they're doing you talk to agents to see what other teams are doing. So that's what this is. And and I also think I mean, it's crazy. I'll and I know fans this is this is a different situation like last year. I think fans grew tired of the kluber Bauer stuff because it just seemed like it was a different report every day and then nothing ever happened. This is different. This is the face of your franchise. This is a franchise shifting decision one way or the other. You're setting yourself up for the next decade one way or the other so I get it. But also like I landed yesterday there were a couple like vague reports and a specific report from someone who's probably never even been to an Indian's game and like everyone's panicking and saying I bet something's going to happen in the next five ten minutes or like we're getting close where there's smoke there's fire and it's like don't be surprised if this lingers I mean this is yeah. This is not the sort of thing that just gets hashed out in one. Dinger one phone call over an hour like this is this is a lot of back and forth between two smart front offices. And again, like even if the if the Dodgers are like will give you Lux and we'll give you may and you give us kluber and Lindor and the Indians are like, we really like this deal like this is this is definitely what we need to do. They still should go and talk to other teams and be like, can you top this like this is going to take a while and I think there are a lot of keep saying hurdles are off. Pickles but there's just a lot of things that you have to check off before you make a trade like this and I won't believe it until incarcerated.	1.0

I agree. I agree. I mean looking back at you know, my life just long so far, but when I look back in my life, you know, I know there's times when I wasn't the best person I could be you know, and any and those those moments, you know, if you know, you can't redo them, you know, there's times when I have been unkind I have either verbally been unkind or I've mentally been unkind and both of those things are you know things as humans, we you know, we got to deal with we got to recognize it but hopefully learn from it as well. And so, you know as we notice unkind things because it's going to happen in the classroom. We're Notice on kind things. Hopefully, that's the takeaway that students can can learn as yes, you know, this happened and and showing them how that's not the person they're going to want to grow up to be right. That's not the person and and when they can look at you you teachers out there and see that person who they're going to want to walk in your footsteps and hopefully that's the takeaway from today's episode.	1.0

I'm okay, but real talk like the whole room disappeared and I'm just staring at her and got caught her eye. She staring at me and I was kind of you know, shy so we kind of both shuffled and kind of made like a Mid-ground like I'm not going to your sides. You're not going to my side and then I think I just walked past and I just like your eyes are beautiful and she was like, so are yours and then that was it? Okay. I got the number.

Yeah, the other thing is you seen a gamer movement going around - they're doing really yellow for gaming but I think yeah because you know, I guess gamers are being discriminated discriminated against Idol.

You're supporting The Gaming Community. Okay. So after we were going to go on to our next topic after their hetero parade and Go funny stories funny stop Thomas you want to talk about that Mouse thing because you know get a little bit of curious. Okay. So this is actually something that I just thought everyone should know if you haven't been keeping up with like science part of the news because I don't think that's I don't know if it's right up under shown on or anything like real news yet, but scientists have been working with a with a gene editing tool called. Crispr has nine and you can edit things and fix things and they were able to make they're able to do things and like they were able to basically cure HIV in most mice that had it because you know, they they got mice that had HIV and erotic. Okay. Now we're going to try to get basically get rid of so they use crisper and they're able to get rid of HIV so their plan now is to try it out on humans and see if that works and I mean I mean, that's one of the biggest steps.	1.0

I think this really is not that bad but things could get much worse and that helps me. Yeah, but I also Tell myself a lot if I'm starting to feel crap, and I just want it to end.

So so opiates there are several nervous system depressant. So people think they called an overdose emergency by this actually respiratory emergency like it's going to decrease your Drive so much. You're going to be very slow respirations to know respirations. So when we talk about signs and symptoms, those are a lot of the signs that we looked at. We looked at what's their breathing rate is going to be like eight respirations and minute or less or not reading at all. Now they're going to be signed on if it'll be blue in the lips pale blue. The fingertips could be very sweaty or die Frederick it go to be little bit of vomitus or foam in there are way as well and then the pinpoint people sort of are the other tell Tale sign right there is what some crews are seeing now. They're seeing some other drugs on board that are really they're still keeping them depressed. So we're giving them the locks on and it's knocking off the little bits off of your opiate receptors and blocking it appropriately where it should be but the people are still saying depressed from another drug on board so I can benzodiazepines and other things like that. So, What what we're seeing now with that is that still that respiratory emergency like you we can't forget that we need to breathe for these people on all oxygenate them and then transport them. So in our back to our kits and suffering of that were teaching is we follow this the save me campaign so stands for stimulate Airway ventilate evaluate your medication and then evaluate again, so we want to stimulate try and get them. Awake painful stimulation see if they respond at all. They don't respond. Then we go into the airway. So we're opening their Airway. Then we're going to be ventilating because it's that central nervous system depressant is depressing their respiratory drive and we want to auction auction them and breathe for them. We want to breathe one breath every five seconds for them and we can keep them alive and keep them sustained by breathing for them without even giving them logs on fruit and then after that then I'll give more value eight if there's no real response and we get into her medication and then at that point we will be administering your first story dose of point for intramuscular. So we taught everybody had a breakdown feels drawn up properly and landmark throw it in a few other Miss like that people think need to expose the scan. You can't you can go right through the clothing if you have to sew in the deltoid or the thighs the best spot as well.	-1.0

I wouldn't say necessarily outperform but the consistent mayor's brain trays you fucker they raised in something, you know, and yes, I have I have some errors that yeah, they're there. I'll give you an example. I had a little old mare 124 her name is classy cat. And so that married be like how she be 18 now, but every cult we've got out of her box there and like to some degree like whether it's shining really in a far potential or dis good, you know, and and in fact, I don't think I have one that's went to the NFR yet, but I got a couple cold. That sure look like they're suspects it just matter of whether they stay healthy and and continue on what they're doing. But but she was probably only I'm in today's world. I would say she'd struggle to be an 18-point her. She was just a hopper. She had cool a cool style. She just wasn't that shiny, you know, and but her cult certainly outperform her that's that's for sure. But at the same time You know, she wasn't very big or was it still have her so she isn't very big and and and just not very talented. You know, it's sort of like a like a football player, you know, if you're not that big and strong it's pretty hard to be very good at it. Yeah, but but he cried but big doesn't doesn't things with her and she's yeah those coats are showing up pretty good, you know, so so in 2005 kind of when you took over the whole deal what What was the stud that you put out and how how to his cult perform? Well the first the first year so okay, so I bought the horses in the fall of o5. And so the actually the mayor's were already bread. So I didn't really make a stud decision until the spring of o6. The spring of o6. I went and I leased a stud and I am so thankful. For that now I went back and I kind of I was kind of a little bit rough earlier when we were talking about how that some of the old-timers are and when I say Old Timers, I mean the the established bucking horse programs. They didn't they weren't really willing to share intellectual property with you and they were pretty pretty quiet and tight-lipped about what they were doing. Well, I was very lucky. I become friends with with the Sankey family and in the spring of oh sick. Exile East a stud from Ike and his name was star belly sneech and so star start at least it was just kind of okay, but he wasn't that good of a boxer himself, but he is Mom was Cindy Lou Who and Cindy Lou Who who was among a really famous mayor. I had that went to the NFR bunch of times and she was a daughter of Custer, huh? I believe I don't have a pedigree chart in front of me, but is if I may Serves me correct correctly Cindy Lou was a it was an own daughter a Custer and and then that sire to Star belly sneech was a stud of cork owes name confused velvet and he was and he was a really good sire. Like they had a lot of luck with that horse. And so anyway, I took start releasing each and brought him to the mayor's like I told you guys earlier that I thought were the best. You know of what we when I had bought from from them guys and when you say that you mean like the best as far as bucking horses are the best that you thought would be the best broodmare type forces. Well a little of both right? So what's the one thing that I did also a little bit different when I first started I knew I was behind the 8-ball little bit and all five or o6 when I first put this done out with the mirror. I know I was behind me. ball as far as in terms of I told you guys earlier that the breeding program that that I bought, you know wasn't real organized completely mined out on what what matters were produced and what stuff for the what and got out of it was just kind of just a bunch of horses really and so what I did is started, you know, but, you know, obviously with bucks who we had all our old mares and boxes and stuff, but then I went to bucking some young mares and and doing some stuff that way and then I started breeding some young mares like some three and four-year-old Billy's to to try and get ahead of the curve and it wasn't that I wanted to turn those those fillies in the broodmares at all. That wasn't my intent. It was just to get a cult out of him to get to get ahead of the game a little bit and and and and I use you know, a couple things, you know to decide number one was obviously Secondly was was the you know the pedigree of the mayor but but again, like I told you that wasn't completely organized. So it was kind of kind of kind of sorts to navigate through that but then the other thing was confirmation, you know, I talked a little bit ago about classic at one of the one her problems was why she couldn't Buck any harder or be any better than she was just for confirmation. She was too small and built a little bit wrong. To be to be really rank, you know are really good. So, you know, you can almost look at a horse and see what how is Styles going to work? You know, how he's going to block? You know, a good example is Butler's you know, Benny Butler you guys are familiar with that and I'm sure everybody knows Benny Butler Rodeo business. Well, they're there the way their horses are bit built their big kind of lanky kind of raw. Bone horse. And they got usually a highway others, you know, and they're they're just built to where you know, they're going to be dropping they're going to Buck hard and they're gonna be dropping and they're athletic they're really built that way and and so that and so in terms or in turn built any does have a lot of stronger horses that will turkana guy and Buck Em Off. Yeah, I mean and but they also can be 90 on them, but they're just they're built that way then on the flip side of that you can go and look at Like Kirby's heard in Utah the Kirby family their horses are a little bit smaller not as high withered little more kind of I don't want to sound say I'm wrong because I don't want to be like I'm down on them because they're awesome horses. They're just kind of like a little fat horses, you know and very little and so because of that because I have some of them to they Hawk they're really the guys because they're little bit. They're not as They're not built to be strong. They're you know, they're really effective and they have cool Styles and they're really flashy but they're not going to they're not going to block anybody off because they're just not built to do it. So yeah, that's that's certainly a big component in the bucking horses deal is is the confirmation, you know, you have obviously the pedigree but the confirmation means a lot that's interesting. So you said that you were namely blessed to get that stud. I mean it was where the first set of Coach really good or how to pan out.	-1.0

And I agree and that's kind of the thing. I've been kind of working on for weeks. And you look at the to Iowa tight ends. I said, no laughs and is Jordan Reed 2.0 T. Jay Hawkins kind of Chris Cooley or me is ceiling would be like a Jason winner Greg Olsen, but I think Fant your said is much more Dynamic his Arias of nine point eight nine. His combine was absolutely incredible and he was a pretty good player for a long time and I will Hawkins to really broke out last year, but fantas been doing it for two three years now and Kirk Ferentz players tend to do pretty well in the end. Whether it's George Kettle, we've seen Now setting records or Scott Shannon had a nice long career in the NFL as well. So Iowa tight ends tend to do pretty well in the NFL and I think there's a solid chance as well that one of them will be in Green Bay for me personally. I am actually in Amber with Brian Burns and all those concerns about his frame and everything, but the Packers need that edge Turner we look at the Smiths. They're very very good players, but having a guy with the speed and build of a Brian Burns gives it that extra dynamic. Thing where you could have all three of them on the field and really cause problems with that as well. But like you said there are so many guys in play at 12 and maybe even trading down into the late teens to get fans or treating up from 30 to get fan because I would be surprised if they take 10 players with with the capitulate is and with with the chance to really get some special players. I think they might trade up a couple of times on maybe they won or at the very least day to as well.

Well, thanks for coming on and hope you have a good offseason and be ready to back go back again next year. Oh right on the volleyball side of things what a season for the girls coming into the year. The focus really was on everyone that graduated the girls return just two players from last year. And the question was could the young players on this team play well enough to compete at the varsity level. There was obviously some talent but what it translate to Varsity the first year and the answer ended up being a very definitive. Yes, the girls went 12 and 2 and won their first dvcac championship since 2004 15 years ago. Oh, that's a long time and this wasn't like soccer because the boys had been there the last several years and they were kind of expected to be back in the championship for the girls. This was kind of Uncharted Territory. And as I was standing there watching the consolation game before the championship the girls looked like they were locked in and ready now hindsight is always 20/20, but they looked like a team that was ready to go win a championship and it showed right from the start of the game. They just look like they were much more prepared to play in a game of this magnitude than their opponent was they won. The first game 25:21 and pretty much Controlled it the whole way. It just never felt like Chestertown could get any momentum going in that first set. And the thing is we made a lot of serving errors. I'm not sure the exact number in the first set but we made 13 serving errors overall. That's a lot. So if you take away those serving errors, this was a complete domination in the first little bit of the game. That was the only way Chestertown with scoring. We were doing everything else better than them. And after that first win the girls came out with a lot of energy momentum and were dominating the second set. I think it was like 16 to 7 when Chester town called a timeout and coming out of the timeout they were able to regroup and start to play their game a little bit. They came all the way back and we're within 24 23 and they were serving the ball and they served it out of bounds and gifted us that last point for a 25-23 win. And now it was to nothing the last set started off poorly for GMS Chestertown. Got an early lead in maintain that for a long time. It felt like our girls maybe it just taking their foot off the gas a little bit. They just weren't as crisp with their And their hits as they had been in the first two sets, but they got a timeout refocused eventually took their first lead at 17 16 and then didn't look back with a score of 2421 Chester town called their final timeout, but it didn't help Amber Humphries served up an ace For the Win. It was a very exciting moment for the girls as they celebrated their well-deserved Championship. So really the question for this season was how do you go from losing almost your entire team the year before including two All-Stars and one all-conference player and Glee start brand new in win a championship with that team and I think a big part of that is good coaching the coaches recognize where their strengths and weaknesses were and put girls in positions where they could use those strengths and not have to do things. They couldn't do and coaching is great. But ultimately it comes down to the players on the court and you had two freshmen coming this year who were very good hitters and Amber and Kailyn and so you wanted to get them hitting as much as you can and in order for them to be able to hit you need good sets and Riley will pretty much give you a good set every single time even if she The bad path she's going to set her hitters up with a quality opportunity for a kill the strategy is if you can get Riley setting the Amber and killing as much as possible. You're going to be in good shape. Not a lot of teams in our league have three players as good as those three and it showed in the championship game and then aside from those three, you want your other three players on the court to be able to minimize mistakes and make the easy plays you want them to be able to dig when needed give Riley a good pass for a set. You want them to build a serve well and not make a lot of serving errors and I think they did that between Amanda Renee. Elsie and Emily you got solid role players that allowed the team to succeed they knew their jobs and they performed them well, and I think this team really showed what good teamwork can do for the success of a team in any sport not everyone's going to play the same role on the team. Some players are going to get more action more hits more shots, whatever it may be and the players need to recognize their role and buy into it for a team to be successful and the girls did that a lot of that's on the coaches to put them in those roles and make sure the players clearly understand their roles and in my opinion, that's Made this team great and weren't that tall? In fact, there are high school volleyball team. They would be probably considered short. So when you watch them play, it's not like a jump out at you right away, but they just worked really well together and understood their roles and brought home a banner to hang in the gym and the future looks very bright for GMS volleyball Riley's just a sophomore Kailyn and Amber are freshmen Emily and Kelsey are freshmen you lose to girls abandon Renee and you'll need to replace them. They played well, but there are some quality players coming up for the Middle School ranks next year and I think you're looking potentially at another really good year and I think I think they should be the favorites in the league heading into next season a few Awards to recognize here for volleyball Kaelyn Amber Riley and Amanda were all chosen to play in the dvcac All-Star Game. Amber was second in the league in Aces with 43 and forth in kills with 82 Riley led the league in assist with 172 and she led an Aces as well with 45 and second place for us. This was 78 so that each shows what a wide margin. She led a sister. She had a hundred seventy two second was 78 Kelsey was 19th. And Aces with 12. Amanda was ninth in Aces with 18 and Calum was first in kills with 125 forth in Aces with 31 and seventh in blocks with seven. There was a little bit of controversy with the volleyball All Conference team when the teams were first announced that the All-Star Game a couple of weeks ago. Kalyn was named all-conference and she was the only one from GMS to be named all-conference. They chose six players that night to be recognized as all-conference members now, they got it wrong. There was some miscommunication there there should have actually been eight players selected for that team. And so what happened is the His went back and re voted for two more players to be added to the all-conference team. And when they did that both Amber and Riley were selected. And so we ended up with three All Conference members Kalin Amber and Riley. I do think it's kind of absurd that Riley especially was not named all-conference originally in the top six. I think if you look at both the stats that she put up and just watch her play. You would know that. That she definitely is one of the six best players in the league and maybe could make the case that she's the most important player in the entire league. If you look at again her assist numbers 172 assist compared to second place with 78. She led the league in Aces as well. I think that she should have been on that top 6, but regardless they got it, right eventually her and Amber were also named to the all-conference team. So congratulations to those three. Kaelan, Riley and Amber. All right. I'm joined Now by Renee and Amanda. Hi, so you guys did not play volleyball last year. You decided to play this year for your senior year all in all.

So, you know once they get discolored so yeah the stovetop though just around the burners you're wiping that every day and then the back control panel area. But on most days you're also going to want to wipe the front of your larger appliances, you know with some kind of a spray and a paper towel or maybe your microfiber cloth whatever you use is it's not important what you use but you'll want to wipe the front of your dishwasher your oven the outside of your refrigerator.

It's getting there. It's like a really want to keep doing this.	1.0
I think if we could go back we could have been a little a little bit looser with our promiscuity, you know in the thing is as we had very strict boundaries for what most people would say because well first of all, both of us were grown up adults and he had his own house and you know, he could have had me we could have been hanging out at the house, but that was one of our things we didn't go in the house together. Ourselves unless there was somebody there I most definitely did not go into his room whether he was there or not. I didn't go in his room. Like there was just some things that I felt like it was very clear boundaries. We weren't like laying down together on the couch. Like there was just things, you know, there's just things staying staying horizontal. No staying vertical don't stay here. Don't stay horizontal staying vertical, you know, while you're hanging out that's that's one way to make sure that certain things, you know. Staying pure and so we would say, you know, we look back on our dating and though we were very very strict, you know more than most people that you know, I don't know we can't really compare but probably very strict and in comparison to what most Christians would say that was their dating boundaries and I would say if we would go back we would definitely be more strict because the thing is you cannot steal something from marriage in your dating time and then be fulfilled fully like you're supposed to be in marriage the same.	-1.0
Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Fan into flame podcast. I'm your host as always Tyler warfel. Thanks for coming back and listening to another episode on this episode. We're going to give our season recap of the Fall Sports season, which were tremendous really historic seasons for our volleyball and soccer teams. We interview the soccer Captain's Christian Josh and Auggie. We also interview the volleyball seniors Amanda and Renee. We did have a slight audio malfunction during the soccer interview in my iPad fell over but we decided to just roll. That starting with soccer the boys won the dvcac championship for the second straight year by beating Chestertown again this time by a score of 3 to 2. In my opinion. This was the best of the Championships since we've been back in the dvcac the last four years. We've played Chestertown each of those four years. The first year was 2016 and we'd split with them in the regular season. I kind of thought we were the better team Alex scored an early goal in that game, but Chestertown scored to kind of flew key goals. The first one was just kind of a bad mistake barkeeper. / and the second one was a little controversial in that it was a long shot from near the corner. It looked like the ball might have gone out of bounds in the air and then come back in regardless. It was enough to give Chestertown a 2-1 win the next year in 2017. I don't think there's a question that we were the better team. We had beaten them for 1 and 5 3 in the regular season, but the game got kind of ugly there were lots of fouls going around the final score ended up being 4-3 in overtime. But three of the goals were scored on penalty kicks to from us and one. Them there just wasn't really a good flow to the game which in my opinion gave Chestertown the advantage in that game and to their credit. They took advantage in one in overtime last year, even though the final score was two to one. I feel like we kind of dominated the game Chestertown scored late to make it a one goal game. But as a fan at least it didn't really ever feel like we're going to lose. It was a great atmosphere great environment IDE Turf a lot of fans a night game under the lights great atmosphere, but we scored early and pretty much control the play. Why this year was different? Like I said from a fan perspective. I think this was the best game. I think the teams were very evenly matched. They both played. Well Augie scored in about the 10th minute to give GMS a one nothing lead, but Chestertown pressed up and scored a nice goal about 15 minutes later the tied at 1-1 and it looked like they really had the momentum at that point heading into halftime and looked like we kind of needed to regroup but right before halftime Augie worked a little magic. You dribble between a handful of Chestertown Defenders and scored about a minute. With a half-time whistle to give GMS a two to one lead. That was a huge goal to get the momentum back on our side but Chestertown came out in the second half continue to press continued to play well and they found another equalizer with probably about 25 minutes left in the game. They got a long throw in from either Corner found an unmarked man for a header to tie the game at 2-2, but with 10 or 15 minutes left Auggie again dribbled past a few Defenders got into the box and got tackled from behind for a penalty kick which he converted pretty easily in the To the upper left corner, and that would be the final score it ended three two, there were some nervous moments at the end Chestertown kept attacking and had several good chances, especially on set pieces and Corner kicks, but our defense held on Christian had a really strong game. David was really good in gold and I think you had other Defender step up and play well and not make mistakes. I thought between Austin and Kobe and I thought Adam and Cody did a good job, too of not making any defensive errors. There were a few Corner kicks that were a little worried. With Chestertown players that were unmarked but overall the defense gave a really good performance. So it was a really exciting game. We had a lot of fans support despite the fact that it was a Saturday afternoon on the day of the Fall auction and not a very short drive up to bear. So it was a good day for GM s soccer a great way to end a really good season boys finished with an overall record of 13 wins one loss and 1 tie this season. They were 9 and 1 in conference play and obviously dvcac soccer overall. Is not the highest level of play, but I think it's improving and there weren't as many blowouts this year as in the past couple of years Chestertown Calvary and Faith Baptist were all pretty competitive. But in the three non conference games, we went to wins and 1 tie combine this year and last year and you have a two year record of 29 wins one loss into ties with to conference championships. That's really impressive and it's actually the best two-year run in GMS soccer history, and I think it just speaks to the job. Mr. Bechtel has On as a coach in building a program and there's been some really talented soccer players the last several years and some of that have been kind of unexpected. You know, Alex Augie and Christian all transferred to GMS for high school and didn't go here during elementary and middle school. So it's always nice to be able to add that level of ability into your program when you don't necessarily see that coming from the Middle School team. Then you also have Caleb and Joshua Lee who are also very talented soccer players that have been at GMS since kindergarten and throw in David Mendez into that mix too. But what's impressive about what the soccer program is a right now is that you get a lot of production from guys. You wouldn't necessarily consider themselves soccer players. You can see the Improvement of skills year by year from guys like Kobe and Ryan and Carson and Adam guys. It didn't really grow up playing soccer. But Mr. Bechtel gets the best out of them and to me that's the sign of a program that's here to stay and speaking of that. This is this team has no seniors. So they'll return to everyone from a team that just had Tremendous season to look for another big year and in our leg there aren't a lot of seniors Chestertown only graduates to Calvary just one and Faith Baptist doesn't have any seniors either so look for next year to be a really competitive year in the dvcac and I know that like worship rep who's kind of the top dog in the easyacc has seen some of our scores last couple of years. They want to play us next year. So next year could be a lot of fun for our soccer team will wrap up soccer with some awards because we've placed first in the regular season. Mr. Bechtell got to select seven of his players to play in the dvcac All-Star Game this year Junior's Augie Pacheco Christian quillin, Austin, swartzentruber Carson UNC and Josh Willie were selected along with sophomore David Mendez and freshman Nevin Yahtzee for Christian and Josh. It was their third All-Star selection for Austin for Augie. It was his second and for Austin Carson David and Nevin, this was their first time playing in the game Augie Christian Josh and Devon were additionally named to the all-conference. The team which is the best 11 in the conference and that's a really high honored to be named that team. We have posters that we make for the all-conference players. They'll be hung up at school sometime in the coming days. Augie was given medals for being the leading goal scorer and the leader in assists in the conference during the regular season and Josh was given one for leading in assists. He and Augie tied Atop The League for most assists a few other statistical leaders that weren't recognized at the All-Star games, but just throw these out there David Mendez was six in the league in goals. With seven which is impressive because he mostly plays goalie. Christian quillin was seventh in assists with for Carson Yahtzee with 18 goals with 6th and 10th and assist with three Nevin Yahtzee was 7th and assist with for and 11th in goals with four and then obviously all he led the league in both goals and assists 21 goals 11 assists and that's just in conference play Josh tied for first in assist with 11 and was 16 goals with seven. So that's a wrap on soccer. Make sure to come back next year and watch Team that we return everyone and some exciting things could be happening next year for our soccer team Auggie is just two goals away from becoming just the eighth player in GMS history to score 50 or more goals and Josh is just one assist away from joining Auggie in the 25 assist Club. Joshua be the seventh player in program history to have 25 or more assists look for that early in the season. All right. I'm joined Now by Christian. Hey, Josh and Auggie captains of the soccer team. You guys had a great season last year you had two of the all-time greats here Alex you leading assist of all time and EMS history killed the leading goal scorer all time. You lost them to graduate from last year and yet you still managed to have a great season. What did you have to do this season to make up for the losses of those two guys.	0.0

All she thinks is that her son is getting like a tact and so she's just coming to His defense like I'm not gonna like argue with her something and I said something like that was like I'm not gonna argue with her or say anything mean to her. She's just a mom were looking out for her child, whatever and I was kind of the end of that and then it came out that like she was hacked or something like they hacked her account to do all this. I was just like how desperate are you to start like drama?	-1.0

That's maybe that's why I was totally biased towards doll me to level so she was less annoying. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, I think she actually killed the brunette and then accordingly we Gucci Mane. I think that's my there's definitely my favorite out of all of the songs on here. I just think that be was dull but I like all the production my homies are trying to argue with me and he was like man, he's like just sound like some simple shit he over here talking about his kids and talking about, you know, I'm sorry cardi B every song by Mike. What else are you supposed to do? Like, this is what he's been going through for a whole year. Bam, like I would rather him talk about what's going on his life then fake it and act like nothing happened because we clearly know this something happened. So this is what you do when you grow and you make songs and you make projects about your life. Like you have to grow you have to evolve like obviously he still talking about like the same old shit, like like getting money and mess with women is stuff which I still find it funny because they're like was like, we know what's going on with your life. But you know, you still gotta for the people that I get. Guess halfway don't listen or don't care. You still gotta keep up that Persona in a sense, but was still even with that like he still had some like some like really really touching and personal songs. Like don't lose me. That was a that was a very personal song Father for the very first songs on here and then came a long way that was probably like his one of the most personal songs those three right there. But but overall like I like the production I thought that you know for the majority it was upbeat. I was messing with it compared to the other two Migos projects and I think their overall like like in this is just comparing all the D'Amico's like he had the best like it was it was just no question. He definitely had the best albumin and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of songs on here and I've been listening to it ever since it came out. So so that's my take on it. How you feel about this like	1.0
Yes. Yes. I know. Okay. Yes, of course I do and that's been evidence of this right?	1.0

I need some money desperately and the the story that came out just after the summer transfer window where it was wolves didn't know where they were going to be in the Europa League. So they were going to invest we know definitely going to be in a plane at least two more games and you would hope for maybe eight more games to get to at least the quarterfinals. So give me another two first-class.	1.0

We usually exposed what we've been doing lately. We used to expose 25 to 30 of them depending on you know, a couple of things just how well I like the young men remember a little bit ago. I talked about exposing young fillies, you know for three four year old Phillies. Well, depending Come on, how many I want to put in those into the system for you get a cold out of so but to answer your question directly. Yeah, 25 to 30 of them. And then generally that means that you'll get you know, they'll they'll be a few measures that don't get bread. So you'll I usually shoot to have 20 calls a year at least 20, you know 22 you'll end up with so if you exposed 30 mares, ideally you'd get 30 calls, but generally speaking you're going to get 25 or 26 right in that area and then and then same same deal as finally read exposed 25 meters. It's more like, you know, you know right around 20 to 21 22 and then there's been years like I Beretta I studied calvary's a couple years ago. Tiger Warrior actually, he's are really really great blocker and really bread well and when we breath tiger Warrior, I put him with 20 mares because that was the deal we made. Made with those guys and heck. I think I only ended up with 13 goals. And that was it that wasn't tiger Warriors fault or anybody's fault. It was just one of those things where that was year was real wet and rainy and and not lost sunshine and the mayor's didn't circled. I'm sorry didn't cycle that well, and and so it wasn't all his fault. It was just one of those things that have Mother Nature. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, I when I talk to our vet around home here, and he said he was having trouble. Even getting like the cut and horses and reining horses in the people in the with the saddle horses around he was trying to having hell getting a the mayor's ovulate for him, you know, so it was just one of those Springs. It was just a tough.	-1.0

They pick up the ball turn around in like lightly toss it back employee comes over get out of my store and kicks him out, but the funniest actually even funnier than that. So the same day all this happened basically on the same day the small stuff Ricky Caleb and Ryan they all went to go to a store and buy the new year ago. Name it so Rick. He's like yo, Dave and Thomas. Can you watch my sister and my girlfriend make sure that you know just get into trouble you in trouble. So we're sitting there me and Dave on our phones maybe about four or five minutes later. They start whispering to each other and they they just booked it. They're gone, right they're not running but they're like walking really fast the way I looked at Dave and I go Dave where we should we watch them and they was like, yeah, we're probably like me. It's okay. Ricky really get it tells you had to and I like and then I go actually maybe right let's go. So we started going like to follow them. We were like, okay, let's not get too close. Now, we're gonna hopefully Palms so I don't know if they want to follow them. But you know, Ricky told us watching so we're walking and we stopped for sometimes like we're stopping. We're like, okay, we're going to stop here watched you and they move and keep going and then at a point I go there they are. ER let's go there they're walking and the lady goes to us and she goes that's not funny. Don't do that. I was like, what are we doing?	-1.0

Yeah. I was just like feeling myself at all times both great ages good.	1.0
Well as it get up. We're my middle schoolers on Jupiter Grades so that you can like log in at any time.	1.0
Yeah, so, I mean that's how a name gets tossed out there. I don't know the veracity of the report that was was out there. I mean if you look at the facts. If you traded Lindor and Clevenger separately you get so much more than if you treated them together, you could find a team desperate for starting pitching trade them Clevenger and get a top prospect. And then some you trade Lindor and Clevenger together and it's like yeah, you're gonna get a huge haul but you could get a huge haul for both of them separately. I think the the more realistic thing first of all as I've said they're going to go to Clevenger and Bieber at some point in the next month or two and say let's talk Extension. I think there's a better chance Beaver signs agrees to something then Clevenger does but as we said like Clevenger was a late bloomer. He's about to be 29 years old. It's going to hit free agency at about 30 right before his 32nd birthday. I don't know if it seems going to give you that. They're not going to give you the Gerrit Cole Stephen Strasburg type deal at that age. So it's and you gotta prove yourself in the next three years. So it's a little riskier. So maybe he signs. Maybe he doesn't if he doesn't And I think he does become a logical trade candidate a year from now not the type of thing where like Trevor Bauer where they really wanted to get rid of them. But you explore just like they have with tons of other guys, but I don't think it makes much sense to trade him. Now. I don't think it makes any sense to include him in a Lindor deal to sweeten the pot. I think you could dangle kluber in that package certainly maybe a younger picture. But yeah, I think you keep them separate and then During Bieber or the reason why you feel like whether you trade Linda or not, you're still going to contend and be a threat to win the division and make some noise in the playoffs.	1.0
But a lot of like senior portraits and family and at the time that's the best that's as good as it got for me because I'm again. This is a small town. This is a small-town Southern Indiana and this guy was teaching me all the stuff that he had learned for 20 years. So I'm taking this and I'm trying to implement this as much as I can on set while with him, but at the same time I'm in a telecommunications program at IU and I'm not I don't feel like I'm learning. Earning anything right now and taking it's a university. So I'm taking these hard math classes finite math and you'll later once I got going in into college kind of my Junior and Senior year.

What is happening off the top of my head is movie studios hired this AI. Oh, yeah to determine to like read the scripts and determine What actors Is and actions is to use that will be most beneficial to well Studio. Yeah, I don't I don't like that. I don't like that at all art. It's not a science death of an industry. I mean the Rocks going to have 37 movies next and what happens breakout roles, you know what I mean? Yeah really know that person or you never thought they'd be right for that role Bruce Willis for thy heart that would have never came to be if this AI test for sure bail would have never been Batman. I know boom never little bit of the rock. Yeah. What maybe this will finally be the end of Will Smith though? I don't think so. Don't keep us are looking at the Hard numbers and realize he's not doing as well as everyone thinks a b or he'll be in every movie If I had to bet I'd bet the a ice pick and Will Smith foremost rule. No not after they see I will try and kill him. Yeah. Exactly. I Robot there's no way we'll spend any more movies dude.

I was cleaning every night taught me to bring the energy but how personal training came about was. I was training my mom and my dad one Saturday morning at Cal Fit and I was stretching them in the manager walked by and he approached me and said that I wasn't allowed to like instruct or tell them what to do because it would be a liability but He offered me an opportunity and he said if you take the certification through our club you could be a trainer for us and pass the certification and the rest was history.

These couples was they talked about having clear boundaries. And so for all of you out there listening. I'm going to give a little bit of homework here, but you should even if you're if you're in a relationship if you're not in a relationship, especially if you're not yet in a relationship, but you should write down clear boundaries and you should have them prepped out before we're on where if you start dating someone that you can have a sit down and say listen, this is the boundaries that I'm committed to when I spoke to this first couple they said men and the The wife said it was so good for me. I have such trust in him because he sat down he had his boundaries. She had her boundaries. They kind of came to a consensus and they said will never cross there someone if we feel like it's getting to be too much someone's going to yell and they and I asked him I said, what would you do differently? Is there anything you would change and they said honestly we didn't and that's really the fruit. You don't want to leave it until you're in a compromised situation to exercise self-control. That's when it's too far. The Bible says to make no. Vision for the flesh. If you find yourself in a position where things are being compromised. You've actually made an allowance in your boundaries. Your boundaries should be that you're not in a compromised position and not only that but like Krista said to avoid the appearance of evil you doing that. I mean there's there's coffee drinks that I can't take pictures of and post on my Instagram story because like Nitro coffee, it looks like beer right and so I drink Nitro coffee but almost drink it in secret because it's like I can't it's coffee. I don't have any taste for alcohol. Never touch alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. It's not even if it's in and if it's in my food if I read it on a on a restaurant menu, I don't order that thing because there's alcohol in it, right? That's how that's how strict I am with myself on that. But but I won't take pictures of it because people all of a sudden think what even if it's one out of 200 who doesn't know that I'm in the craft coffee and love good coffee and thinks I've got I'm drinking alcohol. I just won't let it happen. So avoiding. Yeah if it causes one.	-1.0

Yeah. So yeah. So once I got out of the military I came to Utah my parents live in Utah and it just again not super internet e days and so and I guess I didn't feel very good. It was strange even having been in the military and having gone some of the places that I went, you know, Kuwait and strange places. I still had kind of a problem feeling like I could just go like to LA. And live by myself and go to college they're like, I didn't feel comfortable with that partially because I was married at the time and I know for me I would've been fine being broke sleeping in a gutter going to college in LA, but I was married and so I had somebody else I needed to take into consideration. And so I felt like I couldn't like drag her along to do the same sort of thing. And so the kind of the compromise I think was moving to Utah to Salt Lake where my parents lived and go into the University of Utah has actually had from all from everything. I'd heard a pretty decent little film program moving from Idaho, right? No, so I was in England. Oh God. Yeah. So yeah grew up in Idaho. But then when doing military like left, Idaho and never looked back and and so I was yeah, I was stationed in England for most of the time I was in the in the Air Force and so it's moving back from England back to Utah which I like I did take the short route from Idaho to Utah for sure anyway, but yeah, it kind of took the long way around and so yeah, like I decided I'm like I'm gonna go to film school and you know, like I think Film school is definitely a conversation that could be had another day. Is it worth it? You know, there's a lot there's been a lot of talk about that like, you know, sometimes people say the best film school is just you know doing it, you know, and like I actually don't disagree with that especially in today's world. Yeah, especially today's world is when there's so much online you can read about like there's basically just textbooks online you could you have access to like every movie ever made like you can do a bit of self film school and like equipment like honestly, you know phones, you know, you can grab a phone. It's got a camera on it you can Start you can start doing stuff much easier than you could back when I started in school. There's more content and filmmaking today than there has been ever ever actually seen as such a crowded like this is the stuff I want to do stuff as a kid and like part of me wishes. I was born about 20 years later so I could really taken advantage of all this like at a younger age sure.	1.0

I don't even remember he was like, please leave. Yeah, something like that.

Maybe having a coffee station in your formal dining room. But at this house are Keurig is in the kitchen and then I guess the coffee station mentality is still there because I have a little sign about coffee and I keep some bugs and teas and sugar right above the Keurig. So it's still that concept of having everything right there where you need it to make coffee. But it's in the kitchen now, but consider having a coffee station somewhere else. You can get a lot of cute ideas for that on Pinterest. Hopefully you've had enough time to straighten up your living areas.	0.0

But anyway, yeah, so yeah, so that with rodeos I I don't fight Bulls anymore. But probably one of my fondest rodeos ever been to was Salinas. Oh, yeah. She's in the bullfights are think five five times. But yeah, I that was that's probably the coolest Romeo been through I like the heck out at Rodeo in the history and the Heritage behind	1.0
So basically that that's 22k section took me three hours like challenging said, you know, you're you know, you're an ultra Runner when you say I've only got a marathon to go now.	1.0

I know man, I think I'd is the tough one, but I think I'd rather go the month and just get it over with.	1.0
Bye. Bulls you can you can at least find find somewhere where they'll get along and don't just have to put them all together. All right. Yeah. Well and I try not to mix too much with young and old that's the other thing you guys probably the same thing is if he generally when they're young and Too Young or whatever young and old this doesn't work. I try and mix bulls that are kind of in the same kind of age bracket. Not not too much because II If you get too many youngsters In Their Own Zone, you know how many Smart Ones they're all just thousands of goofy. But then at the same time I try and just do it that way. I'm not saying, you know, and I don't know there's there's mixes that you're thinking it's all right. This is a perfect mix or getting along great and then one day the fight breaks out your welcoming six and you know, we all know that that program but So that's how I how I have my set and then the sixes or so, but and then the second part of your question, I already forgot. What were the how many trips you you put on the moles a year? So, you know, we have 20 rodeos and and that includes some bull rides and stuff. So not as we all know not every bull goes to every event but generally when they go they got they get back twice, so probably around, you know, 15 to We find out it's probably early and and but remember our our season doesn't start till the end of March and it's over, you know, probably around middle of October. So we kind of so strip for pretty consecutive. It's not like we you know, you know, it's spread throughout the 12 months. We only Rodeo for about seven months out of the year. And I mean excluding you like the NFR and that kind of thing, you know, but you only take such a hit small. There, you know a handful of them on speaking in terms of the whole herd not just hand out of them, you know, so yeah with with that being said have you I mean being that you know, and I think if I'm not mistaken and maybe it's changed now, but some of the rodeos out there California and stuff they may only have rights or buying buying bulls. Have you figured that some Bulls just can't take that whereas, you know, Omaha and and Boot Hill and bad news they can take That right? Yeah, so I actually most of the bulls that you're right some of the that is one thing I've learned about the bull deal that I I did not know before is I didn't realize how important in this sounds really silly and kind of naive but I didn't realize how important the the deliveries were on on the Bulls until the last few years before I you know, I always kind of treat them like horses are pretty good about you know, they kind of take a scoot out of there and they go pretty straight for a while before they start into their Circle. Usually well with the bulls as we all know if a bull Curtis back right gate, he he's so wired and program to do that right there if the gates in his way or if everything it's hard for him that change it up if they've if they've done it done it very long a good example is is so I have a good buddy in the Northwest and you guys know him and my Quarry he has a bull call Cowabunga and so Years ago we were going Cowabunga is always out of the left and we decided he Mike's bringing the reading and reading rodeos. All right. Well, we might thought well heck we'll try and figure out how to get Cowabunga out of the the right. So we were going to we're going to running through this dry if running through and making turn out of there out of the right. We hiding tailed just dry. Nobody even there now we can it was all we could do to make that simple sucker turnout. Out of there to the right. He just wouldn't get one do it just like is the only thing that has to be spraying or something. I don't know that goofy little pot liquor. We couldn't hardly get him to turn out of that properly and finally, II think what we finally ended up doing is running around running around in and doing it until he finally kind of went out there but it kind of ran down the gate even dry. Anyway, we tried to Buck him and it didn't work and gave her a ride and all that. So going back to my original point the it's if if they've if they've been out of one delivery very long. It it's so programmed in their mind. So for me, it's been hard to switch him. But I just try and change it up when they're young, you know before when I see like when I buy up a little if you know we get to a place is only has rights and and hopefully the Bulls young enough. I see I just start changing them up right away and and make them, you know learn to do it that way now. Obviously, I have some that don't don't don't ever change like jive turkey you were talking about him and Was too a while ago, you know, he's right there to the left. He's never been out of any other delivery and he's really good. So why would I mess with it?	1.0
I like I was trying that's what I try to do to my kid. Like you said like you do in Hamilton, what does that mean? I'm not gonna get into it.	-1.0
And did you did you didn't play it dude? I was at work. Yeah, unfortunately not. I saw you as making game though.	1.0
Yeah, the only time I'm trying to think of I feel like we usually say immediately when the Indians make a trade that they got the better end of it. Don't we like I mean, I think the night that Trevor Bauer got traded it was like we found out one named after another and it was because at first it was like think we do we try to remember the order because I was going all around the room trying to get Intel from players is they heard from people or Get you know, you get a text from a front office person at one point or a an Asian and and it's like you slowly pieced this together and each piece. It was like, oh my God, this is like better and better. It's unbelievable. I feel like most of the Indians trades your immediate takeaway is they got the better end. Like I remember like the Eric Gonzalez trade and who knows how that will end up it was said like a three four. Three or three four two. Yeah, and obviously Max Mara was a bust but like Jordan loop low looks like he's going to absolutely destroy left-handed pitching and maybe more and they have them for a long time and are cazalas every time he played on the field last year. He injured one of his teammates. So that looks like it's immediately that seemed like a decent trade because Lupo had a pretty good minor league pedigree. The only one that didn't was was the on Gomes trade and we all look foolish now, Your Roberto Perez had and seeing what Daniel Johnson could do. So I feel like they always seem to win trades immediately. And I mean like obviously long-term. They do Francisco. Mejia hasn't done anything and the Padres have like been in the market for catching. I hope so. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what that sentiment is. Like if they end up trading Lindor who is everybody's favorite player and clearly the best player and on the roster Like fans allow themselves to say man. It sucks losing Lindor, but holy shit.	1.0
Yeah, so had the week off cross-training and spin bike.	1.0
This is fine. But like it doesn't do much for me. Like what does it do for you? Tell me what it does for you. I so it depends I guess on the situation like I love a good dick pic because I just need all the information like I need to know what your dick looks like. It just makes me feel like we're a friends on a whole nother level. I love that but also like when you get a dick pic, and it's like I caused this dick. To be hard it is the most amazingly like makes me feel like the baddest bitch the hottest bitch, you know, like I did that I guess what I did. I've never thought of that right?	1.0
You know, you're a boomer. You're like the opposite of a boomer in Disguise, but a manner Look like you're growing then you put on the beard. It's but you're you're you look like you're young.

I was asking her last night in the Press line at Dancing with the Stars just how her comedy has helped her because she is a physical comedian when you watch her on the office and she said, you know, I don't dance but I was a good imitation. That was actually pretty good. I've watched a little bit of the office myself, but she's at least an understanding of how her body moves and I think that has sort of helped her.	1.0

That was so so again my take on it from all the features that I end up liking the majority of the songs. He clearly had the best out of the Three Amigos. I'm gonna give him a 3. I'ma get my three just just based off of off of that along because I really thought especially after the delay the first delay. I was like man, I don't know about this. Like, what is he really trying to do was he trying to save face what else is really going on with it? But I think all in all once it finally came out. I thought they did was a pretty a pretty decent album and I enjoyed it for the most part for what it is the production to I forgot to mention. Yeah production will definitely good for ducks with Delphine. Good night. And obviously that would me that's you know, my biggest thing. I look at the reduction first and then like at the features on there. I'm seeing how you mesh well with the features and then you know, the lyrics come out through for me. So again, I enjoy it down man. I definitely do it. So I'm gonna give it a three. So that's our takes on it. Also Father for I I give it a 3 flight gives a two and a half. So there you go man as I'm review. Let's get to the song of the week. Now. I have to make two chains again because I don't know if you got a chance to listen to a rapper go to the league yet, but there was a particular song and let me not mess this up here give you the proper name of the song, but it had Ariana Grande on it. And it's only called rude earlier. Yeah, it's called rule the world and it had a Camry Camry sample here. I was like, whoa. I said I know this sucks. I said, what is this? I said oh, oh no, I feel like I told everybody on Twitter. I said are we gonna grind a doing uh doing a remix of why don't we fall in love and what I'm going home? He's like nah, he's I always felt that I was like, yo I said give it a chance man. Give it a chance. I'll legs actually a good song where you like. Nah, you like I'm good. But it just inspired me to like go back and listen to the Emery. So I want to we fall in love and when she came out. Oh man, I forgot like how hot she was fam. Like this song was fucking dope and shit. So I would have listened. I was like yo, this song was bumping yo, they beat was was dope as hell. So this is going to be my song for the week and that was inspiration from the from the sample remix for a router word vagina Grande en change to chase album. So Amory, why don't we fall in love? This came out in 2002 people 2002 to memory did take a long break, but she did apparently come back. I haven't even get channels in that album. Do I ain't even gonna lie, but but you did come back and start making music again, but when we first came out man, she had a bus. She definitely had a bus. So I respected that and this was definitely one of my favorite songs from her. Why don't we fall in love the find Marie Van de saint-fond is that stain? Wait find is that they I death he had a crush on her face that want that one thing video, bro.	1.0
Yeah it was and so when I first started right at home staging I went into it thinking I'll just do pre-sale consults and I'll just get my experience through that but very very quickly. I realized that people wanted their In properties furnished and so I had to then go and every job I got where I needed Furniture. I would just buy for that house and it has just accumulated over time, but I don't have any higher options. I think Canberra is probably the closest and that's 3 hours away. So in a regional area, it is a huge investment at the beginning to grow your inventory and I have no regrets like I absolutely love it. But yeah, you do have to act like quite a lot. Yeah, no, definitely an egg because you've got your own stock.	1.0
I got guys I Supply the champagne today.	1.0
great topics actually today so I can already hear a few.	1.0
All right now and I'm so glad you mentioned that because this is something that not only we need to be doing with our students, but we need to be teaching to our students. That looking people in the eye and saying hello Yeah, and it's amazing to me how much that effect can have on someone and I'm probably overly do this. I probably had annoyed the heck out of people a big city because I do now that I've got the travel a lot more with my career in education the way it is now like I go to DC quite a bit I go to I was in New Orleans last week I go to some big cities, right? I make a point no matter where I'm at to to look at people and say hello, and I know that one. Our parents have told us like all the time don't talk to strangers. Don't talk to me. But why not? You know, I'm not saying go get in a conversation with someone and tell them everything about your life. But when you're walking past them on the street. Hello. Hi. How's it going? How are you? You know I say hi to every single random person I passed and I get some really dirty looks I get the shaking of the head. Like, why are you talking to me? But why not? You know, why not just say hello. I mean, it's a simple simple thing when you're walking through a Lobby of a hotel Or when you I don't know. I know it seems like it should go without saying right but the do it and I get that this is educated for reached out to you here and obviously we sincerely hope you're doing that your students every day. I know all you amazing educators are saying hello to your students when they come in every day. That's that should go without saying but teach that to them why not teach your students to start doing that around the building for starters, you know instead of don't tell them to go out and just talk to every stranger they meet but say hello to every single person that passes them in the hallway or or on the playground or at lunch or in the office or on the bus hallway, cause there's no talking in the hallway screwed.	1.0

So The thought came about because that at one point I can't even remember when I launched the bedroom packages, but if this was quiet and I needed to create another income stream because when you're not staging properties, you need to find that how you've got to pay your bills, right? So I thought these bedroom packages would be a really nice idea because I had clients that would say to me. Oh, I just want you. Come in and transform my bedroom and just do it. I'll pay you so I kept getting these little hints from people. So I thought I'll try and make it a reality and it's a really simple concept that you can purchase a bedroom accessory pack and instantly your bedroom is made over with beautiful art and cushions and lights and it was really well received and I then started working on living room accessory packs. Kind of a similar idea. We just add the artwork in the cushions and the lamps but it all is in a theme.	1.0
Yeah, we do. We have done some jobs work with Reebok with the North Face OtterBox like yeah, lots of large Brands and by the way, just to just to throw us in here just so everybody has context for who Dave is Dave ma pert is a very close personal friend of both of ours. But before that he was my boss. He hired me. So at this company, I'll just go into the name is expert boys. I he hired me. An editor there and after about a year or so that's when he made the call to Drew to come in to start expanding our video team, right?	1.0

Sylia Sy L IAA says the same thing driving. I hate that my kids social life depends on me. Karen Brown 50-49 says taking kids to birthday parties and having to make small talk with other parents. I agree. I don't like small talk and I don't like other parents everybody who's listening to this right now accepted. From that statement you get it? No, it's like not including them. I love all of them. Oh, well, that's sweet Mel. MOG 82 freezing my ass off waiting for baseball and football practice to end. I don't have that.	-1.0

I mean, I'm a running coach and also a mouth as if I listened to the podcast nose and we get so fixated on top running for a certain time. I finished time and I and I had a client say Only once during the speed session and she'll quite often doesn't want to train with a watch on at all and not even know you're like your $10 digital watches you guys. She said she wishes it there was a watch it didn't measure your time, but measured your your enjoyment like so, you know, especially, you know, if only we had a way of measuring like other metrics for our run and so it'll be good. You know, you get to a point and your little watch says that you're enjoying yourself, you know, like do Native watch for that but because I didn't I get so I do I keep saying on on getting time goals the truck certain training sessions and and making sure I was getting heart rate goals and you know, all that stuff. And yes. Yeah, so I think you would probably you seem like the kind of person who would like to buy a watch. It measures your enjoyment and not your time.	1.0
Oh, I'd be happy to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed the episode. I thought everybody was wonderful and nobody should have gone home. Are you feeling okay? Oh, yeah, this is not okay. I don't accept this Marie. Where are you Lorraine? I actually really did enjoy the episode. I actually thought it was a great Challenge and I will admit when they do great things. I thought it was a great. Challenge because it is something that drag queens have to do maybe not from start to finish creating the whole event, but I have a lot. Yeah, I have a lot to say later, but that's all I'll say right now and everyone who's joining us in the chat room.	1.0

A question that I wanted to know and I think it's probably going to be different for every Rodeo guy. But what you said you buy most of your Bulls are all of them what you just bought some seen some dummy trips on what are you looking for? I mean, you know, you're not you're not competing with them. It doesn't sound like so what's the few quality traits that you really looking for in a good one? Well well Oh guys look at the air and kick and spin but then for for me that that I guess that's I like speed. I you know might Corey and I always round and round about this because you know, I like I said a little bit ago Mike Corey and I are good buddies and bikes been at Northwest bull man for years and and he's in the break over Bulls. He likes bulls that that break over and old knock your job. You don't hang around you've been hanging around on kiss so long, you got the same flavor. He does with the speed a little bit when they have that intensity and speed all I know I like him to kick. I'm not gonna happen. But you know, but you do look at you do look at this. That X does a lot. You know, there's a lot of guys that even in this day and age they don't care how they read.	1.0

I'm just saying let's not act like there's no act like it ain't you ain't true that you know allegations ain't always been out there Sion right on stuff. Yeah. I thought that that very first song that actually opening track which was I believe it was father for got really personal talk about, you know, his oldest son and all the stuff saying how you know, he was 17 when you had them and she like that I felt that shit that shit was that shit was kind of tough. Okay, and then you touched on like him, you know getting in the beef and shit like that with other rappers and stuff like that. I just seen like Snippets of the stuff with him on that Ebro and he still talking popping off his like second. I wanted to get behind them after I watch that Breakfast Club interview that he did it was like, okay, maybe he's in misunderstood. He turn right back around saying how like the you know, the older the older generation should basically should you know should thank them and shit like that. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Like come off am like we were I was rooting know the hold the Vivica Fox me my was rooting for you. That's that's how I was now. It's kind of like, I don't know FAMU just you switching up on me too much. So yeah with that being said those would have the songs that I like the most on it without no talking too much on it at that made man was hot. It was probably that was probably my favorite song at all. A made man was hot like the said the Wild Wild West Joy I'm with her. I wasn't gonna that shit was tight to and I said the cardi B Carter be stole that, you know saying she had the best verse on on the whole album to me do anything for clout? Yeah. She had the best verse on the album on the entire album with all those features Gucci. It was a lot of features to like, I think it was like 16 songs and like eight of the songs have features on them. So that's a bit much for my for my taste. I mean, you got 16 songs. I don't want to see more than like for features. Just my personal my personal preference, but that for that I'll give it a go give it a two and a half out of five. I'm gonna give it a two and a half. It was the best out of every solo project from them.	0.0

Could you just back? I mean obviously when we couldn't go to a situation where we're holding gold coins and paying for things with gold and silver the physical mental again. I guess that's never going to happen, but we could have money that's backed by gold or silver and therefore it we could make small transactions because it's just a denomination of of a percentage of a gold bar. So in other words when Bitcoin first started out it was Worth mere sense. It was just a tiny value. Now, you have to trade a very fraction of a Bitcoin in order to for it to mean anything in in real money. You can't send somebody one Bitcoin has to but it's true.	-1.0

Someone asked me on my Instagram or on actually Behavior bitches Instagram because I did the November motivate and move challenge because I really I find actual joy and moving my body. Like I know that when I go to the gym and work out with weights do things I actually feel a hundred times better. My anxiety is a hundred times better. It's not so when they said well, what's how do you find motivation? I'm like, it's more that I really just enjoy this. I'm not like having to look. Outside of myself to find the motivation the motivation is actually within me because of the way it makes me feel right the consequences that come after it during it also like I don't look at it as like to go to the gym. I look at it as like this is my time to show up for me and knowing that it's probably benefiting my body like not even physically of how I look but like internally like my heart muscle, you know, like things like that. It's so much more than just. Oh, I'm doing 50 squats and losing weight in my butt looks better like what about Internal organs your you know, everything that you don't really think about when you're thinking of oh, I have to go to the gym absolutely.	-1.0
Even just from the hands that are on set but the things in pre-production like helping you sell that and getting that money helping you write and make it a good story like taking taking critiques, you know, like you guys all read the script and you guys all have ideas like and it's being having the people around you that can be honest and open with you and say like hey this part stupid. Yeah, and then I say you're stupid. Yeah, and then do you know and then we're doing it my way take your cheeks very well. No. No, I'm just kidding. I think again this could be a huge topic later on is it will be his Taking taking criticism you can take criticism well, and it'll do nothing. But benefit you there. There's I think there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. But again, but yeah having those people around you and all having a team people with different sets of skills. All coming together to figure it out is for me. It's this is a team sport. That's what it's all about. You can do, you know, you can make little videos in your bedroom by yourself.	-1.0
Stood in the statements you were making about Syria being a suit serial Builder and I've heard it said in the past and I believe this was amongst commercial users that 90% of the things that are built are built by a one-time owner. I don't know that I could substantiate those statistics at this point because that's probably 10 to 12 years old in anecdotal at best. But are you seeing that as kind of the Difference Maker it seems like that's what picture you paint. That's the Difference Maker between a large industrial users is that they've got the capital in the know how to plan? Whereas these commercial users that are in there from one time. They don't have the capital to know how or the care because the savings aren't large enough to go into it with a mentality of we're going to prefabricate. We're going to modularize we're going to do off-site construction. Is that fair to say?	-1.0

Welcome to the wrong culture podcast. My name is Dane ver way. I'm an experienced Runner and running physiotherapist. I created this podcast not only so I had an excuse to talk running each and every week something that I love to do, but more importantly this podcast gives me the opportunity to interview fellow Runners friends and health professionals in a relaxed and easygoing format. This podcast is designed for the everyday Runner so we can all live learn. Grow and enjoy everything there is to running together. I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome back to episode 17 of the wrong culture podcast today. I interviewed a man Clark one of the athletes are coach from the Run culture hours. This is the third time I've caught up with Damien over the past six months. Although as you'll hear today's episode is a little bit different Damien's had a setback. He's recovering from an injury. He's had a month off running. Whereas over the past 2 episode Damien couldn't put a foot wrong. To in pee I have to pee. I love this podcast episode for a number of reasons one because I feel like a lot of people can learn from it anyone who's currently injured. I think we'll be able to learn and just sympathize with Damien over the past month and what he's going through. Damien also shows a fair bit of maturity in this episode. He's learned a lot since he had a major injury this time last year and he's definitely gone about this injury a whole heap better in terms of how he's viewed it and and Managed IT. He certainly has stopped listen to it and tried to get on top of it straight away. I also liked this episode because it shows that her load management isn't in tight tirely. The reason for this injury. So we've Damien. Yeah, he missed last season's track season and then we started introducing spikes so that it could do his 1500 and 5K races. And yeah, he's got saw in his foot because he started to use this. Spike's more but really the way that we introduced the spikes was very slow. And a lot of people would have been able to tolerate this load. So it shows that how how everyone's different and we learn from our experiences. So Damien and I will be better for this. We all know that okay, we have to ease our way forward and slowly build Damien's tolerance to track spikes and the speed work involved on the track. And this will come all right enough for me. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Okay, here we are again with Damian Clark and I will catch up.	1.0
I didn't even I didn't even realize what happened until I saw the feathers explode everywhere and I did you wait.	-1.0
It's a drag race AfterBuzz TV drinking game. Mark disobeys his own rules take a drink. Yeah, what did you guys think of the episode? I thought this was a really creative challenge. I was excited by it a fresh new challenge. I love Design Channel channels. I love design challenges. They remind me so much of like like Project Runway and I just love seeing everyone kind of work as a cohesive unit. Well, some people work on the cohesive unit and I just thought it was really fun. It was very light-hearted. So everything's positive. Just wanted somebody to hand me that paper.	1.0
It's just a boomer coincidence. No such thing man. You got to put the pedal to the metal. All right, if you don't work, you don't get paid.	-1.0

So yeah, so it's like and Jughead loves it because I well he loves it because he tells everybody back at Riverdale High. It's like yeah to hang out with people that are actually Read Moby Dick, but I'm also thinking like well so far out of that Salon we never really saw much of anything with some people griping about having to read it and then we saw Brett being frustrated because Jagged butter pie. Point right really hear anything else from any other student made me think like yeah, these guys are it was really in-depth discussion about Moby Dick right?	1.0
It's like I'm basically it had like all the opening season intro for exactly legend of the bit disappointed. I don't think some of my friends have had a chance to listen to all the audios.

Love to You hear? Yeah, looks like I finally get to hang out with you. Yeah, when I lived together in Austin, it was perfect. I actually lived with Yell sister Talia in University of Maryland in college. And then I was moving to Austin after to follow a boyfriend. I didn't end up with and old days, right? Yeah all days good times. Yeah, and talia's like my sister's moving their you should totally live with her and I thought I was going to be living with this sorority chick and she was not let me tell. Tell you she is like an earthy vegan if I accidentally didn't recycle something you would think the world was going to end and she was like catch me eating like Twizzlers and stuff and be likely I why you have a healthy alternative. Let me cook you up some I don't even know what she would make. I mean these smoothie Bowl she'd make in the morning, but I got access to all of this because I was living with her. I mean it was the coolest year of my life.	1.0
It's not even that interesting. But yeah, let's have fun. So I guy Guys just want you to sit back.	-1.0
Yeah, I think in the last game you guys had a lot of turnovers and I think if you guys can minimize the turnovers, I think you guys will be. All right. I think it's going to be a different team that they're facing and they they're not ready. I don't know if they're ready for this this live over Hamlin pod 540 because this team has seemed to come alive in the last second half of the season. People are comparing this team to the 1994 Hamlin's team. How does that make you feel? Because with that team being that what that team making it to the state semifinals as well. People are comparing those two teams. Does that how does that make you feel to think? They're comparing us to that t that same team?	1.0
Oh, I was just going to ask you to like, what do you think about Titans? I know that they had in there like a some in their file. Files they had tried it and they said it didn't work. But but it always keeps getting Revisited on the internet the people like what if it's like the end game where they drop Titans or something like what's your perspective on it?	0.0
Yeah, that's true that is but that is a hard one to really go through. I was thinking cockroach at first but I mean, it's a whole bowl and I don't think I could eat a whole bowl of cockroaches.

And as long as that divide exists, like locks are always going to be powerful because there's going to be a group of people that they're just going to work on. Oh, So that's sort of my ADC recap from a game theory perspective some of the big tournaments coming up between now and the end of the year think the big one is going to be the noogie worlds. And I think there's a couple in between that so I'm looking forward to kind of watching those and seeing what the trends are that we can learn from. There's a couple new studies that are in the pike at high percentage. I'm going to obviously keep doing the podcast if you want to check out my interviews with Tom to Blossom. Eddie Bravo, they're up on grappling Insider. You can just type in either my name or or one of their names into the search bar and we are starting to do a little bit more interviews as we get access to the athlete. So hopefully they'll be some exciting stuff coming up with that. I spent some time this week reorganizing the website because I felt like it was it was harder than it needed to be defined older articles. So what I did was I sort of read it all the categories and I think I have Some basic categories right now, which is Game Theory articles stats and research articles and podcasts articles and then all the articles I kind of like tag with their keywords. So if you are just looking for an article that you're not sure exists just try typing in the search bar should be a little bit easier to find than and spin the past. Yeah, that's just been a long-term thing that's been bugging me and I'm going to keep trying to make the website better. And of course make the podcast better. Thanks everyone for Or listening. I'll see you next week. Have a great week of training.	1.0
Mole that he he he has been reacting to everything. I feel like in a very normal way, but I don't know like wait. Why did he come? Like, where did he come from? I'm just curious.	1.0
I I totally agree and I think it's so yeah like the loose just great and all the places that you need to go to. Later, as you're moving towards the circle is just it's perfect. It just lines itself up. Yeah, we're definitely all right.	1.0
Just jamming it in that way doesn't make it sound good down six seven.	-1.0

No, in fact, what was amazing about that layoffs was you know, every way it was sad man. I remember he was you were like ball. Oh it was I was a don't tell everybody I was ride room I waited till I got my car and I kind of you know, I just walked around just leaving Trails of Tears behind me all day long, like slipping on the my best friend just got fired. No, dude it was Cool, because you know why I was back the next day on contract worth making more making more. So this this is where it gets fun because okay third and I'm done with the layoff stories. I don't I have not gone back to a corporate job since then, there's positive things to find about these layoffs for sure.	-1.0
Wait, wait, wait, wait, it gets better. She's walking away. And it's all there's a sign and the dog walks around the side and she's on the other part so looking so she wraps around. The fine was great. That was dude.	1.0
So the other day, I'm at Sacramento muhittin hip and kind of making shoot forward and had a little bit of a different day that bull usually right there to the right. You like he'll go like a round or two right there to the right in the gate and then he'll jump forward and go back a left generally, but the other day, like I said, he hit he hit his hip and made him shoot forward and then he kind of had a kind of a I don't know. I didn't love these is move before I turn back. But once you turn back then he was fine. But yeah that hit so that will Omaha. I like him. He's a good boy, but he came from a friend of ours up in Oregon a guy named Rusty Gorham raised that boy. So the in their sure proud of them Rusty and Lisa are real proud of that bull. So that's cool. Cool for that deal back here. $3,500 will 10 Bingham was like 93 on them at Kennewick or something. Wasn't he? Right? Yeah. Yeah at Puyallup at the yeah. Yeah, and then his brother Tyler at Spring Road. The only time that Bulls been rode the last couple of years. Other than that the PBR deal, but Tyler Kimball throat. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Hi, you know good good good boy, the 93 I think was a stretch that was quite a bit of points. But but but he's a good-good bull and in back to our point is for for what works for our business and and I'm not saying that works for everybody. But for what we're doing it, it works better for us just to buy the both, you know, so I can see the guys that raise them like the pages I watched. They're Bulls at Sacramento. Watch what they do on the sales. And if not and how they do their their their business and I can see why they do what they do. It works. They block like hell and they sell it for lots of money. So they're doing they do you know what works for them? That's good for exactly. What so what about to you can kind of answer this in the two-part question but like us fraternity guys and stuff what kind of segregate our bulls and stuff and then I take it rodeoing, you know, it's um rodeos may have ample amounts of pain some may not Are they are they just in general population like at your house? And then how many how many trips a year roughly. We you put on a bull? Well, the first the first part of your question is is you nailed it. There's there's a lot there's rodeos have the facility that to split them up pretty good. But then there's a lot of a lot of rodeos at don't have that, you know the kind of facilities. You need to split them up a whole bunch. I'll tell you how I try and make them live. And and you guys being bull guide, you know that there's sometimes you just can't make mixes. There's some mixes that just don't work. They just don't like each other. We know we all know that kind of force them through it and get them to get along but for us how I try and do it as I pay them how they fit on a truck. So in a cattle pot sets of 6 is I got using I got a couple sets of fours or like a set of for a set of three got to be the nose and the back step and then sets Six is on the top, you know the top and the bottom decks. So and then that also fit for the pins that we have in our house, you know, we have pins that are about all half acre lots maybe from half an acre to maybe one acre lot and and that's plenty of room for them.	1.0
You know, how much did you have to adapt to that to now all of a sudden you're famous, you know, right.	1.0
So we knew three days before. So again, we come in like we're setting up for the meet and greet Bashas like iron shirt were obviously turning on the office and funny enough. It was on live TV, so that was great. So watching the office and I'm like crap, you know, I have to go to this meet and greet right now, and I just really To finish this episode. It was like so good. I think it's the one when Jim proposes to Pam or something like that and I'm like, oh my God, this is the best like so good. Just want to watch it and we're like, okay, whatever. We'll just we'll go on Netflix later and like finish watching the episode. I'm like, okay, so we go to the meet and greet. And Sasha Farber turned around to me and he's like, oh my God Meredith is here. I'm like, what? Wait, who's Meredith? Yeah. Wait. What do you mean? He's like Danny Meredith is here.

She'll be an excuse. It's not an excuse to you come up against professional athletes or implied. At all in the way. Yeah, so there is going to be he's a difference there. But I thought Jeff Ward United in terms of how they play with pretty poor. It was direct. He's running the channels. It was it was crap football, but it's so effective not the only game where you look alike. They goal kicks. They push everyone up they make the volcano literally all the players were probably 10 10 meter radius of each other because they know they're going to win that second ball and I can get more they so much the second door.	-1.0

Yeah. I think I think in the next season they get into high school. So they're either an eighth grade.

So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right.

I searched for my favorite event. It's no longer in this sadly was the living to be encouraged challenged and that was well over two days and that list from O'Reilly's and learning to National Park and it was there a couple of different course options. But the one I did for two years was the double Marathon. So now it's on Monday get up the next day do it again. And that was that was a tough run but it was such a frenzy and Last week's events and I just had so much fun. Yeah, probably about was still on my night.

Well, it marked the end of the band Pink Floyd incredibly contemporary. It sounds just as good now as what it did back then wish you were here the 9th album from Pink Floyd according to Roger Waters Mark the end of the band. However, another one was to come of course namely the wall a beautiful Masterpiece as well. But on this occasion, it's wish you were here and there's a good reason for it. This particular album was when Roger Waters set himself up to be solely the bandleader dismissing a lot of Dave Gilmore's incursions Nick Mason's as well as Richard Wright. It was at the time a real Roger Waters trademark, and that's what Pink Floyd was fast becoming Dave Gilmore's vocals on wish you were here. I think arguably sizes up the salty sweet. Nation of what was the relationship between waters and Gilmour the way that he sung it there's a debate whether or not wish you were here is actually one of the highest performing songs by buskers and artists alike a favorite performed on acoustic guitar. If you go to any Pub on a Sunday afternoon, it's likely that you hear the song performed some better than others. How could a slow song such as wish you were here? How could Contemporary ballad if you like become such a pillar of the face of rock and roll well meaning the whole meaning not just the way it's written what was written but how it was performed how it was sung. There's a distinctive note a pairing and it certainly comes across on this album. And on the track when Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd was released. It went straight to the top of the It's on both sides of the Atlantic. It's sold over 14 million copies just within 12 months. I mean this was going to be a smash no matter what the album itself has. The cover has a man in flames and the other one shaking his hand as you know back then it was actually done. He actually lit himself on fire and shook the guy's hand and then they had to extinguish him. But get this they couldn't do it. Just once they had to do it a few times to get the the right shot. It's just something that was needed at the time. And this was Artistry going in a New Direction actual photographs of people doing this kind of thing. It was a Telltale sign of the stories to follow especially with the wall. That was forthcoming Richard Wright of Pink Floyd later said that this was without a doubt his favorite album. Actually. It's a lot of people's favorite album for many reasons the songs on it are immeasurable just beautiful tracks back to back so So enjoy it if you haven't heard it and if you do have it just pick up that volume turned up to ten on a Saturday night, you know do what you need to do to feel the way that you do and enjoy one of the finest albums and one of the world's best rock albums ever met. Well, that's it for today's show was almost perfect. Wasn't it? You know bearing the 30 or 40 remarkably obvious mistakes.	1.0
Yeah, it's and I should clarify. It's AI think it's a great idea it like I've potentially interested in looking into some sort of version of an And Shop, whatever form that takes. I'm just always every time but I've kind of always thought about it or talked about it. We kind of went back and said I don't know if that even is something that would work. So I mean it's interesting to what's good to hear that for yourself in the area or in that it has been received well, and it's just maybe somebody out there needs to try it and maybe we'll keep watch with interest.	1.0

Right but but over, you know over the years that followed, you know, I kept on like I said reading magazines about it. And this is like in the, you know, pretty early days of the internet and IMDb had just come out and so it used to be so okay, even before that. I would go to this video store and they had like a big like movie catalog or not catalog but like an encyclopedia and so like, you know, the first person I went looked up with James Cameron because he's who wrote directed Terminator 2 and so I could find out like it wasn't as easy back then to find out who You know what filmmaker like what movies he done like a complete like, you know filmography, but then, you know IMDb came out and and suddenly I was able to like search for this stuff. It was all just like text back then right? I was about to say IMDb wasn't out yet. You nailed it? Yeah. Yeah. That's our reference. Now. That's that is our dictionaries. We like I probably Search IMDb for piece of trivia. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 10 to 15 times a day easily totally easily and I'm definitely when you're watching a movie, right? Absolutely.	1.0

I just want to read something that I pulled off your Instagram which I love Yeah, an intuitive eating tip. Okay, guys. Hey Doodles are stocking for us anything deeper than base level that you provide us. Casey will find I might know why I think I should have been a private investigator in my past life. I shagged stalker. Anyways, actually just reviewing the records like you had have to do an assessment, right? Yeah. I'm just reviewing the records they all right. She says order the salad if that's what you want what you're craving. Being in the moment, but don't consistently order the salad because you think you should or you think that's a good choice. Right? So like you're saying if you feel like it in the moment and you want it do it, but don't do it based on. Oh, I have to have a salad, right that's part of the diet. And that's kind of talking about MO is Casey if you know what I mean in the moment, right like you have certain things that in one moment. What are a mosrite a mozar when we talk about kind of the background information that Either increases or decreases the value of a certain reinforcer a Punisher in that moment. What do I mean? Okay. So let's say like my body is in a state of deprivation of having anything healthy in a while. Like I've just been on a at a tailgate all day eating crap in my body. That's the background information, right? So in that moment, that's the mo right like a salad or some things in establishing operation from my body is wanting that right. So that's what I'm going to have right then. But on another day, sometimes I just crave a freaking hamburger to bite into right like that's what I want at the time obviously a vegan one yell never real me moo, but in that moment what you'd still be allowed? Oh my God yells really changed guys Adam. I used to like cook salmon and privacy like I like I like She's gone. Everyone looked at those to make it a JB come to my house tonight and but one thing talking about like demos and what's valuable in that moment. Like one moment. This could be valuable for the next hour something else can and I think of really prime example and tell me if this would be intuitive to me. It seems that way. Yeah. Oh, but so when I initially didn't know what was going on with my hands and I was in hospital and it was a result of not having any circulation my fingers started freezing off and they were like going from Black to whatever it was people would say like what can I bring to her in the hospital? What can I bring? What can I bring in? The only thing I wanted was watermelon and I like watermelon but like in no way is that something like I typically crave or I want or like I need just watermelon and that was the only thing I wanted at the time and like I literally ate like probably like two watermelons a day like just cut up and and you know a few months post like my amputation surgery someone sent me. Me an article from the Harvard Business review or Harvard Business or I don't know my brain is going blank right now, but it was essentially about like the circulation properties of blood circulation properties of watermelon and how like they actually like sometimes recommended as a replacement for Viagra, which I actually take now as a medication three times a day and no I don't have erections because its original use was for blood circulation. But anyways, like my body was telling We got you want watermelon. You want watermelon now, do I crave it? No, but that's all I wanted at the time and I found that so fascinating.	1.0

Ring well, it's very exciting. And I guess it's something that I was a little bit naive probably being in Brisbane in the capital city. We had plenty of options when we started for hiring Furniture. So that that wasn't a limitation, you know, it was our real limitation was how much what you know, what happened we quickly could we build relationships with agents how quickly could we actually win some work and whatever work we were able to win it was either going to be constrained by you know, how many employees we had or how you know how we're going to actually fulfill. The orders whereas now I've met more people from Regional centers or rural sort of places something that didn't even cross. My mind was that there aren't even options to hire furniture and a lot of those places is that was that the case for you?	1.0
Well, I mean I started thinking about gold from one entry point of view and of course gold would be much better money then feared money that we use today, but I've come to the conclusion that as many other people before the gold is not actually the best man at their Probably something the best money would be something like silver. So I think precious metals probably the best choice. So I'm not a Bitcoin Advocate and so on and like experiments like Bitcoin because they're free market experiences is a great deal of thinking that goes into this great creativity and what I like about it as a professor is that it gets people to think about economic mechanisms or the economic Concepts and so on. So this is all great about Bitcoin, but still don't think that Bitcoin will be good money. So I think the traditional monies that we had in the past gold silver still the best one. Sorry.	-1.0

That was the best thing I've heard because there are so many people in my oh, I'm sure oh my God, there's a lot of people that have input on your life. But but you don't really really like them and really have no idea what you're going through. In your personal life. Yeah, so if they don't know if this is a good quote if they don't know you personally don't take it personal. There. It is. Alright bang. So this is like kind of funny because we just had a like deep discussion and now we're going to talk about sex. So we're all over the place. Yeah. I mean honestly, we just this is a shit storm, but we're doing our best but we these questions are actually kind of amazing and there's also a story that we can share. Yes, that's us Also, it's also just horrifying. All right. So, um, we're not announcing and everybody's in everyone's Anonymous a lot of girlfriends contributed So, yeah, thank you to our girlfriends. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks ladies. So the first question is do colleges actually have sex parties or is that just in the movies? No, at least. I'm not any I know about and I am I probably would not ever want to go to that because that's a little scary. Yeah. No, I mean I've never really heard of that. I've never had the invite. Oh God. Yeah. No, I haven't had an invite. I have heard and sort of maybe seen some weird things but I've never like I think the closest thing to a sex party has been like seeing people in a club like just all touching each other and really having yeah, like literally having sex like, oh my God this greatly. Yeah, so like, okay like that's all but that's not even a sex party. That's all I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really know a little bit more private about my sex life. So saying this is like weird for us to talk about. Yeah, I well I thought it would be we thought it would be funny. So yeah, I think it's hopefully just in movies or if like if you're in a public school Define sex party orgies. Yeah, like I don't really like her but cut in my nose. Yeah. I mean maybe some people do I think if you go I'll ever Arizona or I think it was those big crazy schools. Like we went to Suffolk. I was still in school in Boston. Yeah. I went to school in Vermont and we did not have that experience. No, I think I think that's just in the movies girl. I think that's a little let's all pray together that it's just in the mood. Let's pray. The next question comes from one of my girlfriends and I think that it's just like such an amazing thing so should body count be a topic of discussion in relationship. Oh, I think if somebody asks your body count, they should be prepared to probably not be the happiest because if they're asking their Curious and they're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I mean Yeah, or they just want to know so that they have it against you without saying they want to hold it in you know, but I'm also the type of person I'd ask because I don't care I've asked every not that I've dated a bunch of guys because I haven't but everyone I've pretty much been with. Oh I was asked to I've said how like what's your number because I like especially people I've dated because what am I saying? I've had like one serious boyfriend but with Cody I've asked him and I it's nothing I would ever hold against somebody no. I'm not at all unless if your number is outrageous then that's a little questionable but it's definitely something that just is like I'm just curious like it's not that I'm an insecure person. It's just that I just want to know want to hear how naive I am. This is how it this is how bad well this was also a few years ago. I was still in college my old roommate Grace her and I were like in my bedroom and we were talking one day and she goes what's your number and I literally was like nine seven eight eight five three, and I don't know that's not even mine or telephone number. Yeah, and I started saying My telephone number and she was like no. No, she was like you idiot like your body count and I was like, oh I was like, I don't know. I've never thought of it. I don't know why I don't think of it all that much and I think that's probably just because it's not something that's like a game-changer in any of my relationships because I've never really been with someone who's like slept with hundreds of people saying yeah, but that's that and if someone but I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be interested. I would not be interested. Yeah like I'd be like, okay. Well, obviously If it's if it's over, I'm not going to say like what my number is or like what not my number but what like my ideal number and a partner is but if it's over a certain amount then gotta go because like that's sorry. Yeah. I'm like flexible about stuff like that. Like I know that a lot of people our age like sleep around and experiment and do not like different things. Yeah. So that's never bothered me. We have one question or not. Really a question. It's actually a story from one of our girlfriends. And shoot I was looking through. Okay. Here's Tiffany's. Well, that's not even her real name. So I guess it's fine. Oh God is a lot of Tiffany's there's a lot of Tiffany's in this world. Okay, so shout out to this bitch.	1.0

If so, specialized their skill and pugs that they're so good at like go mid up every round exactly but we don't want that to happen. We want people to effectively put him to put be put into a roll.

They that it could only be used for very large scale transactions. I mean starting with the men's suit may be okay, but then buying things like Vehicles buildings That's also a rather large objects. It is never been really a medium of exchange and daily transactions daily transaction was always silver or some alloy of silver or some or bronze or something like this or this storm. Okay, and that's actually a good thing. It's good that people actually own personally control. The money of the country lutely for mises is we talked about the ocean school before and these economies that I admire most is the end of his career. It was precisely this consideration that you stressed a lot. I said, well, you know sound monetary system. It's the people themselves each all individual Market participants who personally control a part of the money supply and so they only had the money in their pockets or at home and so on. So that's truly Democratic populist control of this crucial social institutions and silver allows that if you impose gold on On the economy and that is exactly what has happened in the last quarter of the 19th century. Like when silver was demonetized was a political movement top down movement and gold was imposed as a money on the the economy. Then you automatically get a shot in the arm of thinking because you cannot use Golden daily transactions that it's you need to have some money substitutes that can take the place of gold but in smaller denominations in Daily exchanges So that's why banking has become so strong and has developed. So strongly in the last Decades of the 19th century. Then of course all through the 20th century now, let me close this in and get to the gold treasure gold. So I start thinking about gold as a monetary instrument, but I've come to the conclusion that God is actually very important in a free society and a free economy as a store. value is eat as a natural way of saving for especially for people who don't know the first thing about financial markets and financial techniques that risk management and what have you very straightforward and simple way to save some of your Revenue to put some money aside for your old age and so on it's just too to stock gold coins and that's what people have been doing for many centuries and I think the reason why central banks are so adamant in controlling the gold price and preventing that the gold price in a foreseeable way it goes up which would happen in an actual free market is that precisely goal is the main competitor not necessarily as money for Fiat money, but it's the natural. For financial markets.	1.0

Hmm should be interesting is to say the least I would have never thought, you know playing Teddy Pendergrass would be like Tyrese. Yeah, right. It's kind of weird. He's gotta do like, you know, they got to put them in full transformation. I suppose. We'll see how it worked. Oh, absolutely. I think that's an interesting story and then like you touching on like people are really interested in any biopics. I think you know for every for every like good when we do have some bad ones, but I mean, I think when I think of like the good ones, I think like the Bobbi Brown one that was pretty good. The new edition was probably the best one. It was a few more and they are you you have then you have the ones like Alia and the other stuff like that. So it's like it was a couple of the bad ones. I don't want to harp on them. But it's I like I like watching those because you get to see you even when you think you know everything about the artist or something like that that that's public knowledge those little those little tidbits to come in and he's like damn I ain't realized that like, will you watch the Bobby Brown stuff? You didn't know he was hitting Janet Jackson like no. I mean how many people really knew that? I didn't so it was like, okay.	1.0
So he like I guess he like does this thing where he pulls up a dick pic on his phone and then he puts the phone face down. He's like that's a dick pic.

I would have A pick the phone up it would have stayed there for eternity didn't have to put the phone down just hand it to me.	-1.0
But yeah, but um, these two girls are you know, like I have no hatred for them at all. It just breaks my heart that there for me still. So giving a lot of toxic information that has been very destructive for me. And the people that I know and love. Yeah, and I just think they're too young and inexperienced and they don't have enough like a wide enough grasp of the world to actually speak to those topics at the top of their intelligence because you know, you're not supposed to question. You also brought up before like we are taught to fear our emotions they always use the Verse, that's like the heart is deceitful.	-1.0
I want to talk about. I'm going back to costumes again all of our had this double pole.	1.0
I was like you can't Guys, like literally everybody's day. Yeah everybody that were the characters like they're all going.	-1.0
So the last thing we'll do is we're going to go into some reader mail. Okay, first up we have Travis. Hey guys and girl with the release of Apex Legends with with the release of Apex. Legends came the inspiration to replay Titanfall 2 campaign upon completion of the campaign. I noticed something pretty interesting in the final mission. There is a huge reference towards Apex Legends. I was dumbfounded the Bounty Hunter that catches you in Titanfall 2 campaign mentions Apex Legends and gives you a and Apex card as a sort of invite to the game pretty cool. This could also eat or this could also even have some relevance on future characters in Apex. Maybe. Could you possibly be Pilot Jack Cooper in Apex or even the Bounty Hunter mercenary General martyr. What are ya'lls thoughts? I mean, we talked a little bit about Titanfall. So I felt like that was a perfect email to bring up. I mean, I honestly did not know that I full disclosure. I'm sorry. I'd actually didn't get all the way through the Titanfall campaign or whatever so I didn't see this but Travis I didn't finish it. It's oh, yeah, I know. II I've always wanted to and it was just one of those things like I think when I happened to pick it up I have to pick it up on a little bit of a sale or something. I didn't pick it up on day one, but I absolutely love the multiplayer and when I play a game and I really really like the multiplayer. It's kind of hard to bring myself to to play the campaign the campaign like really really good example is like a battlefield one. I really like Battlefield ones multiplayer, but the second I went into Campaign and I started to die. I try throwing down a med pack and I'm like, oh, that's right. I can't do that. Yeah, so there was just so many moments like that. I just couldn't get over it.	-1.0
We have gotten together to and we're heading responded to an ask on Tumblr and we got an ask to have cold that will find he create so thank you. Yay. Whoo. And so let's start. How did you even get involved in this mess of a fandom for?	1.0

Yeah, probably this was Frank. This was founded the main advantage of this fact is that Switzerland so small? That's a it's a such a small. It's not even an exit door. Right? It's it's a it's a rabbit hole. Not many people get through this. All right, so Swiss franc is booty best and the problem with this Swiss is a leech bite because the Swiss this still appreciate stable money that appreciates strong money. It's just some of those sweets and industrialists. They don't like it because they see the increased pressure on that on the on the export business. The Swiss themselves. They like in Japan is different stories. Japan has the advantage so much bigger countries. So it's a much bigger economy. But the Japanese if I understand this correctly, I don't know Japanese mentality at all. But from what I see portrait you and always the media is that they are adamant desperate to create inflation. That's definitely not the case with Japan. Excuse me with was Switzerland. Therefore I would say because the it's a more sane intellectual environment moral environment.	1.0
You like all of the seasons before the finale on Disney XD and I was I was like Loki sad because I was like damn this was a great show and it's about to be gone.	-1.0
It's yeah, it's they're trying to saturate the market that's always kind of been there thing, which is also the one of the main reasons. I didn't want to buy Battlefield 5 because it's like it's they've been trying to saturate the market so much which is also like one reason I'd be kind of scared for Apex because it's like, you know how much now that now that it's making money because let's admit like one of the reasons EA didn't give a crap about this game beforehand is because they didn't believe in it, but now that it's making money. I'm scared for respawn because how much are there going to start trying to manipulate you spawn and like I was actually talking with Nate and just wasn't on air. I don't think but I was actually talking to Nate and I was like, you know, well like $18 for a skin that's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. It's a gun come on and I wondered to myself now respawn obviously stated that EA had no hand in making the game, but when it comes to the monetization how much of a hand is he a hat?	-1.0
Yeah, we'll definitely have to see him. Obviously, I've given my I've given my opinion out into separate podcast. I don't want to get too much into it, but it's I can definitely see your point. And I mean that's why at the end of the our last hop up cast. I tried to like kind of Bring It Down be like, all right, guys, you know what? Thanks your thanks respond because I mean we really do mean it. I mean it was super easy for us to be like me happy but instead with you know, we wanted to end it on really good note. So that's that's why we went that way because you know, Of like you it is pretty much just it is pretty much just like supporting respawn and you know saying all right, you know this this one's this one's a given I guess, you know for now because I mean there's not like they can do anything about it.	1.0
So by next big question is what's on the horizon for the rest of this year not with as much as any few months left. So running wise you've got the race this the black all coming up.	0.0
If you want to exercise a good influence on others around something that we see much in politics now intake quite the reverse but Guido, I'm sure old Allison's would want to get in touch with you if they had a people reach you what's the best are you on Twitter or Vine?	1.0
Yeah, so so me and my crew we we Street about it. So we had to make that adjustment but there was also a lot of love back then and I'm talking about within at least like the New York entertainment Community, you know a lot of cash where you you know, you run into Wu-Tang over here you running the Mobb Deep over here and it was a lot of love like everybody was very supportive of one another. You know what I mean? Because we were Everybody was like we all riding this wave and like where is it going? You know everybody's young everybody's ambitious. You know, you had the Godfather Russell Simmons blazing the trail, you know, you got young puff coming up about to tear it up with bad boy, you know Andre Harrell like it's you know, I just have great memories and you knows a lot of great parties, you know, but, you know when it came to the other stuff it was real it was real it was it was it was Tough times in terms of you know, New York wasn't London and I'm saying that because London has the most cameras in any city in the world. Now New York is like London. This wasn't that New York, you know what I mean? So when you come out the club and you go around the corner to get into it the Wolves is on you so you kind of had to kick up dust so people who they knew who not to you know rock with it in that way, but you know that ain't nothing but a little adjustment.	1.0
So back in those times when I've ever been there's plenty of other times when I've woke up with eggs on my head and regret and I don't drink Tennessee Honey whiskey either but so many weird memories, but that one that one really, you know Takes the Cake that one seriously Takes the Cake if we don't acknowledge her she'll go back to like licking the Kelly's like being a dean. And yeah, she needs she's trying to company. Okay. So tell your story that was a great story. Um, so I we each have two stories. So yeah, I'll tell mine then you tell your next one and then I'll tell my next one. I'm going to start off with a college story. So I had a couple girlfriends my I think it was like my sophomore year of college and we I want to say it was like st. Patrick's Day or something like that. Maybe it wasn't I could be making that up but we all like got super dressed up like curled our hair like put a bunch of makeup on like how to hot outfit we frickin wore heels like we were doing the damn thing and one of my roommates from college we will call her. I don't know. We will call her Mary that way marriage a week Mary. That wasn't her name. But we're going to call her Mary. So Mary had a friend will call this friend Bethany. So Mary had a friend named Bethany and we saw a couple of my girlfriends and Mary who was my roommate we went to this party. Like it was like this big thing. And so I we got to this party and you're having a great time. You know, we were we were all drunk as fuck living our best life's I would do anything to go back to those days, but maybe not and so Mary's friend Bethany. Are we following along Mary Mary?	-1.0
I don't understand it. You have three kids and girls.	-1.0
Yeah, you know that might have been what it was because I was never around like a liberal Christians. It was the very extreme. Evangelical fundamentalist and I didn't know that that was like a small sect of Christianity like even recently I just thought that that was normal Christianity and I was like, you know always made to feel like, you know, any type of disagreement was just you're not being a real Christian. You're not being a good Christian. But yeah from the very beginning it was just like this constant theme of Of like you think your life is good now, but it can be so much better like is if you believe in Jesus like you will be like infinitely better. And yeah, it's funny like you mentioned the bedside moments because I still like so vividly remember sitting in my bed one morning when I was 12, and I was praying to God and attempting to repent for my sins, but I just kept saying Did I didn't know what I had done wrong? Like I didn't understand why I was so unworthy and undeserving of his love. I didn't like feel like I was the sinful person that was filled with like the innate evil of Adam and Eve like that. They let into this world. But like that's what I was reading. And that's what I believe like it was the inspired word of God. I thought it was true and all the worship songs in youth group and stuff just kept saying like I want more of you God and less of me and it just kind of like shrunk. I'd like shrunk myself down and felt like I must have been doing something wrong in his eyes and like for that I was truly sorry and you know begged for his forgiveness. And I don't know it was just like this constant theme of know your place like you are inferior by Design and I didn't realize it back then but that was like when my healthy amount of self-worth started to Chip Away And it was like crazy that that was like the moment that I dedicated my life to Christ. Yeah, and then like for 10 years after that Christianity kind of consumed my life my friend group. We would have liked deep discussions all the time. I would go to youth group devotional groups summer school, like summer camps Bible studies. I was a youth leader for a while. And it was just a very like simple Faith but I was always told that you're not supposed to intellectualize your face or critically think too much about it. And I kind of feel like not teaching apologetics is like doing a disservice to your congregation because you know people might hear about these things eventually and then I mean that's like what happened to me in my last semester of college after You know, I was 22 so it had been 10 years. My roommate was a religious studies minor and she was doing all of this research for her classes. And you know, she was having like people that were on the committee of translating the ancient Greek manuscripts like as her teacher and they were telling her these things that I just knew nothing about and it was that same sort of feeling I had when I was 12, it was like wow, like I'm so ignorant like there's so much more. I need to know. And so I that's when I like started my deep study of Theology and I went into it as a Christian wanting to be a better Christian thinking that I was going to like, you know be so solid in my faith and then just as I continue down that path like things slowly started to like not make sense with like the Christian doctrine and my faith was like unraveling I guess in my questions. We're too hard and Too Deep for the Christians around me to answer I guess so I was kind of on my own and I yeah, I decided that like I just didn't think the facts were there. But honestly the damaging part came like after I left like once I just decided I don't think this is true. I don't think I'm going to call myself a Christian anymore. That's when I started like feeling the damaging effects of like what? It happened like the past 10 years, basically.	-1.0
Goodbye. Nine to five rows. Thanks for coming by Mom. All right. I'll talk to you guys later. Love you. Love you, too. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks for that. Oh, she's so awesome. And you know what like goal.	1.0

So yeah, one of the statistics that's out there because it seems like Like we whenever there's a discussion about fatherlessness or the father not being in the home. It just makes his way into our community right when the research shows that more than any other racial group. It turns out that black fathers are more involved in terms of you know, childcare reading to their kids like activities like black flower fathers are ranked essentially number one and you know, we know that obviously being you know, The the product of out of wedlock, you know marriage or whatever or I don't like situation. That doesn't mean your father isn't around right and so people sometimes conflate those two. Now you mentioned it was like something that happened. What was the incident that kind of sparked all is well.	1.0
Sometimes I'll just ask like no really like what kind of day are you having and then just like people are better sometimes about talking about logistics and then like moving into how they feel about it and like a lot of times you can ask a follow-up question or like	1.0
So I think my biggest takeaway from that. Was that putting food in your body that's going to actually energize you. And make you feel good. So fueling your body with food that is going to produce energy. So you didn't go back to eating pizza dough. I loved a literally pizza every day. That's the place.	1.0
I would actually allow you to have those Twizzlers now and there is an interesting reason why because intuitive eating believes that when you put foods off-limits like when you create hard rules about what you can and can't have what's happening on a on a instinctual level as that, you're just actually creating a stronger desire to have I've got food, right? It's like the classic kid with the cookie jar situation. Look what happens when Mom leaves and the cookie jar is now unguarded right like the kids will try to eat as many as possible in order to like load up before Mom gets back.	1.0
I mean a certain way to felt like, okay and then but the first one that they played was just like we were just like, oh my gosh, we just both lists each other and burst out laughing.	1.0
Yeah. You're like a mad.	1.0
So I did not I just know you didn't I don't think I did. I still don't understand why you might agree on that.	-1.0
Then number eight was Cascades, you know what it was when it started getting down because we actually went from one to ten when we were making the list. So we're getting towards the end of it as like, okay. Well do we want Bridges or Cascades and you shouted out Cascades and I'm like, oh, that's a good point.	1.0
me but I used to pride myself so much on being self-sufficient and I don't know like it's another one of those things where I just like felt like it was a thing that you should aspire to and should be successful at and now I'm not so so sure considering like how creative and like inventive and inaccurate my brain can be so I've been talking to a certain group of friends who are also like I would say like dealing with their own emotional homework and	1.0
She was like dragged now when I first saw this that was like, oh she was and she was Columbia I can see why but through laughing the whole time. Yeah. Yeah, didn't you wear this before? She's like now and The crowd I've seen it.	-1.0

So it's true only late.

He just like dragged Jeff for riding in the sex scene and he talked about how there was supposed to be like a moment with Stiles is Mom. But specifically for like that episode there was talk about how Dylan was confused as to why it was going in the direction that it was going so suddenly and made absolutely no sense and because Like there was well there was talk about the how there was supposed to be steric and how it there was going to be a build-up to steric. It was actually going to happen and that there was like plans and there was agreement and contracts between certain actors to like build it up whatever and that it just all shifted randomly for no reason, which I still don't know about it still don't know the information. There's still missing pieces that just nobody need to talk to anymore because nobody's connected to the show.	-1.0
We're actually like back to the news. So we're going shopping later. And I feel like this is what we always do. We like go shopping and then we always end up somewhere to like buy lingerie. I love buying lingerie. It's the funnest thing to shop for and I need some new things. Yeah, because I just want to see how I look in it in like a picture, you know, right? Like that's why I buy lingerie like the number of people who have actually seen me in lingerie is low it in yellow. That's at Best but I've seen myself in them all and they're like some of the best pictures I mean one time you answered the door and lingerie and it wasn't. Oh no the person you thought it was.

Elite divers like the team you're on like how long can you be under water at any given time before you would have to come up for air many hours how many hours because that's a beauty of the real because it recirculates your own from your body has a carbon dioxide absorb in inside it that absorbs that CO2 and then you basically just keep rebreathing and the little tanks of gas whether they be oxygen or nitrogen. Helium for deep diving they just squirt a little bit of extra air in so the little tanks last way longer so we could we would do a tax swims in the middle of the night for anywhere up to three hours.	1.0

So this one, you know, we said I think we mentioned last time that he's the whole thing that he keeps saying is that we can play well for spells, but we need to be able to play well for 90 minutes and we're not at that level yet. We're working towards its what yesterday and we're getting closer because it's not just a 45 minutes and then the second half there's a little crossover. A little you know about an hour or so we play well for now, but it's when we do play with and 90 minutes, I think will bloat.	1.0
She was better than the the bottom tier R&B artist, but she was just never looked at it that the top like the Beyonce's and stuff like that and she came out right around the time like after Leah past stuff like that. So it's like it was it was easy to get lost in that and I shuffle I suppose.	1.0

What when I cry now when you let down when you're in the dark, it's interesting because what I was going to say, there is like when I go for a training run, I generally go for a training run to go in unless in letting you know like out for at the speed session or something and then you know, nothing happens my brains just blank but like if I if I'm where I generally go for a run. That's the reason I like to go running is to going woods, but when I'm right See, I spend meetings far too much time going inwards. And so that's when I like to chat to you know, someone else that I'm racing with and like a hilly course is brilliant for that because on a hill that apart from the elites there aren't too many people who run them. So even though you're puffing up a hill you can actually get you know, a broken conversation going and generally you'll pass like once you 10 10 caves in Two arrays generally then sitting with all the people you probably going to spend most of the rest of the race with and so you get to know people pretty well. And so you can you know, like they can pull you out and you can pull them out and I remember my strongest memory ever was a guy that I was passing and he was out of gels and he didn't realize it he asked if I could take a gel out he got to the stage where he was so wrecked. That the concept of taking his pack off and being out of jail was too much and I gave him one of my gels because he actually run out and there was no way that he was 15 case the next checkpoint and that giving him in my gel made me run faster than if I'd use the gel myself. Yeah because you have someone yeah, and it's and it helped him and after the race he came and thanked me and said I wouldn't you know, you would have never finished the rice if it wasn't for that. Yell at that moment. And yeah, that's probably my favorite memory of racing, you know in all my running. So that's that's my thoughts are going in and out and that's what's so beautiful about an altar and Ultra is it's an entire life in one quick run. Really? Everything is Chandni you end up crying end up hurting you end up falling you end up cheering you sing. You don't seem like there's just Everything in there and that's that's why I love it. So well, I guess I about Lauren's music choice to is she likes rock and roll. I keep trying to convince her to listen to an alternative to rock and roll, but I haven't convinced yet. Well, I do like lots of different kinds of music, but I think you like the Techno stuff which I'm not such a big bet on to say if you scolding you talk idiom. Okay, I don't even know what this is when I'm running.	1.0
Carry me and it's like fuck I don't want to do that.	-1.0
So there I will say this other this also is like it's like it for me. It's just like that standard joke. Let's take off the robe and have saggy boobs. You know, I mean, like I just really like I'm not saying everybody does it but I'm just saying like exactly what I'm talking about. It's just like it's kind of like that. I always used to say when I started doing drag I felt like every time I would go to drag shows before I see drag drag queens would do something and pull out a dildo and I remember starting to do dragon go I will do drag but I'm never bringing a dildo on stage like it was just like I was so tired of seeing it and again, I'm not saying, you know, you just brought up one person who did something similar to that. We've seen stuff like this before it's not new and creative had it been new and creative and fit the song. I would be all for it a hundred percent behind it. It just didn't make sense with the song. I just felt like she was reaching in trying to win the challenge which is the point you're trying to win the challenge. She reached into her bag of tricks and said I'm going to try this and see if it works and it well. I think that Trinity was giving her season 9 like reference but she was doing the Charlie hides. Yeah the whole pining and I thought I was funny. Yeah. Mmm, I didn't catch that. She should have just this Charlie heights. Yeah, well You just as try. Haha. That's funny.	-1.0

It's amazing. But even then even in those encrypt periods chat. I'm not participating but chat representing my view, you know, like there's almost like this we're owner Ali connected and saying the same thing and it's like that's why I love like the streamer and shat relationship. I think it's so unique and funny because it's like we're all supposed to pretend like we have equal. We're on equal footing even though we're all watching One Loser on camera, you know, like it's funny like it should be a there should be some sort of relationship and the best dreamers that I see like xqc and everyone know how to use chat in that way.	1.0
Everybody up just our I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot down a line real brief with it. Just all top because it's so many to name her like I can see like the I can talk on and off ever so high but I won't I was just like just be real brief just the ones I think of off top and then I'll just name a few that I feel like never get the credit. They deserve that I think is really good as well. But I'll start off you got to start off with the Fuji Quincy Jones like Quincy Jones. We talked about Quincy Jones When you talk about his Netflix, Joining, right mmm, but I like how you didn't even know that he produced no saying a lot of different stuff. Like when I was talk about the Austin Powers and it's my party and all that type of stuff. Like a lot of people didn't know about that. You know, a lot of people don't know about the Michael Jackson stuff. The Quincy Jones had his fingers in a lot of shit got though Quincy Jones our IP J. Dilla course, no saying probably my favorite of all time. Probably just the way he the way he laid laid his chops and stuff down was like some shit. Brilliance for like people still can't figure out how you did some of the city due to this day with that. Mpc2000 DJ Premier and other one 9th. Wonder who's my personal favorite right now Riza. Well, I think never gets the credit. He deserves, you know with the Wu-Tang dr. Dre, of course Timberland, if you're not if you're not aware of some of the shit that tamerlan did man like everything from Missy to live to Justin Timberlake North and Nelly Furtado like you name Timberland for someone who's the dude for real? And then I throw in Kanye now, I'll just I'll stop right there. It was a because it's just a lot of different people like I could like opt like people that don't people don't check for as much I believe that Big crib is a dope producer that people don't talk about nothing crisis who's with the soul council with 9th Wonder and I'm he don't get talked about he got some hot shit. It a lot of different people man. Not that's another one that I checked for. What about Hindus to do them? Gz beats and trap beats shorty red Shawty red on the trail. He used to do some hot shit man. Like Todo Jones was hot man. That's a lot of people Mannie Fresh. He was another one I can think of this is a lot of people mantid. You could just go on for hours talking about producer.	1.0

How old do you think you were? Do you know how old you are? You've like first picked up the camera probably six or seven. Yeah. Yes. I was about the same age my aunt and uncle had like a think is like an old Panasonic least HS camcorder and I was probably, you know, actually probably a little bit as closer to about 10. Yeah.	1.0

Well, I actually consider myself an agnostic atheist. So basically agnosticism is, you know a claim about knowledge. Like I don't know if there's a God or not, but I'm an atheist because I don't currently believe in one. I don't I don't think that I don't know like I don't think there's a God I don't Necessarily see a lot of proof of a God, but I'm more open to that conversation of maybe because I know like when people start talking about science and I start talking about like the origins of the universe and all this stuff. Like that's very fascinating to me and it's not something that I have studied as much as I would like to um, but I never want to be like one of those people where I'm like, yeah, there's absolutely definitely not a God and I'll fight you like to Able to prove that it's like no like I don't have this like hidden agenda. Like I don't want there to not be a God on top of that my friend circle like since their identity was in Christ my identity to them became non-Christian like that is all I was to them or that's how it felt and I would be like introduced as like, oh, this is Nicole. She's a non-Christian. Like this is my reward. Yeah, like to their new like church friends and you know more extended people it was like this is my non-Christian friend like that will know that was my label and it was so like demeaning and I'm like literally that's all I am. That's all they see is the lack of belief in their God and then I've had some people stay like you're never going to know true Joy or true happiness or true fulfillment. You're never Have purpose and your life is like destined to be meaningless because you don't believe in our God and that's just like so mean to say and it like really breaks people down and I think that goes back to this idea of like if you break people down enough, they might come back to the belief system and it's like such a manipulative way of going about things for them.	0.0
I'm like getting a cold. Yeah, like whoops. I caught AIDS again. Let me take my S Family Guy would put a let me take my Nyquil cold flu and AIDS pill now, we have two topics on the board still to talk about what thing about talking about some sports and working about talking about climate change. I don't know if we'll get the climate change or get too much into it, but I'm really research too much on it right now so late. It's a serious affecting topic. I think what we're going to do for most of our podcast is we're going to start. With like what we want to talk about get like that. We'll probably move into some funny topics some little game show in the middle and then move into some serious topics at the end. I don't know and put in as though it's good to write.	-1.0
I think how you've kind of raised it to it. It works really well because the whole game tries to force you to play like a team and effective and to work together to be able to start up this Titan or unlock it or you know that kind of thing and knowing that it's at one specific location. So it's not going to be like it's going to be obviously a hot Drop. I think teams will like multiple teams will aim for it. So you'll have like that hot battle outside of that Titan, so it'll be interesting and and I'd have never played.	1.0
So yeah, so I started a job as a editor for one of the local TV station to CBS affiliate here in sorry. No the ABC affiliate here in Salt Lake and I went to the CBS affiliate here in Salt Lake won an Emmy was some of the with a piece that I did that at some point. I'll put a link out there. So you guys can all see it and at that point I realized I'm like, you know, what I've had enough of news could probably actually also do an entire episode on what it's like working in local TV station. I think we could probably we could probably find a really good guest to come on to talk about any cool. All sorts of people, that'd be interesting. That would be a good one news is a particularly rough filled and so once I had made a five-year plan at that point to once I was in news, I'm like, okay, I'm new to this and it is I'm going to get an Emmy. I'm going to get out and because I knew that Amy could help give me other jobs and it has which it has which was the next job which is doing video production for a marketing company, which is actually where Drew and I met I still work there currently do some freelance as well on the side and thinking about what does the future look like for me? Right? Very cool.	1.0

All right, so but what was cool about that is again, I was in there the next day and we I was making more money on a day rate than I was in a week and a half. Yeah, and I then I would come in and we would do pre-production and then I would go and shoots. I was still traveling with you guys. Yeah at that point and they still And in fact in March, I'm going on a diamondback sheet with yeah. Yeah, and and that's you know, it's funny to sit here and talk about it. I laugh but again, I'm kind of it's pretty lucky. That's pretty cool. That's again. It's not lucky.	-1.0
It's a tractor. No, but like the big the core of this game. This is what was so important and what I was scared of which I think is easy to fall into for a game like this is that it takes itself. So seriously, and it doesn't have the gameplay to support it. Do you know what I mean? Like here? I can't tell what's more interesting like the graphics and everything going on or the gameplay? Because if you just have Graphics it's like just eating whipped cream, you know versus like having the gameplay behind it. There's like A cake there that's enjoyable to yeah, you know what? I mean? It's like you need cake you need cake before you put on the process might like to I don't know too sweet. I couldn't think of another example. Okay. How about this? Let's rewind rewind rewind it's like having a chassis of a car but no engine, you know, like a lot of games fall into this, you know where it looks really nice and I just like Wolfenstein falls into this. I think a lot of other games I can't think of but like games like Wolfenstein basically they look so nice and they have like really cool vibe to it. But then underneath the gameplay gets repetitive and is boring but it seems like with respawn there. They always put mechanics and gameplay first and then everything is periphery which adds to it.	-1.0

It's yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Awesome. Now, I have a question. I need I need to know the best cow story there is no I'll say this to our viewers. It's Every time that I see Instagram post, yeah, you've got a picture of a cow and we begin it would appear that you just run from cow Paddock to capitec taking photographs of cats. So a lot of cars out here are the nights have been chased by pi was bloody scary. I love cows out here pretty freaky some acute, but most of them are so creepy. Yeah. It's scary fast. Thank you guy fast actually my day. Yeah, we do agree with that tonight when they get up and go their dog. Yeah. Well, I do a lot of running on my own most of it's on my mind and I'm going to entertain my little brain somehow. So I do take a lot of photos and put them on my Facebook page and make fun of myself. Do you do a very you do a very good job of taking photos of cows? And getting the perfect putting the putting this perfect captions to it. It's the largest is you look at the pattern. Yeah, but then you read the caption and you always end up doing yes. If you didn't jump did you actually burn that's the question exactly.	1.0

That computer could be a gaming system a phone or a tablet people make video games. I writing code the code might tell the characters in the game what to do when a player presses certain buttons. Like if I hit the up button my character in the game will jump level up your brushing by switching to the bottom of your mouth and give your tongue a brush, too. Here's your next riddle.	1.0
Its original so now I have Disney and I have Netflix original that's already what $14 along with frickin like you've got Disney right that it's got like all the Marvel movies, right? Yeah. Now you you've got DC entertainment when they're like dumb expensive. They're like 20 bucks a month. I'm like, yeah, see I feel like because I mean I haven't had a cable for like seven years and I know what a lot of other people don't have cable anymore either because honestly, it's just become Obsolete and I know streaming is definitely having a decline right now just because you're still meant it like the oversaturation. Yeah and stuff, but I don't think it's gonna Circle back to Cable. I feel like there's gonna be some something new like kill them.	-1.0
But I mean, that's there it is a funniest fucking Three I've ever heard when I think of like sex stories. None of that's ever happened to me. No, like that is some like what the fuck happened that night like you're gushing at the knee. I had some what the fuck happened and I wake up and I'm like, oh that was kind of psychotic but like yeah, nothing to the point where I also don't I don't have you ever used Tinder or like any of those apps know I like started dating Cody when that became cool. I've never like an iguana literally never had one. I think when I Freshman College. I made a tender and then like some man he messaged me and of course I'll got it was just so weird and I literally don't think I ever answered. I started dating someone and like never responded and just deleted it. So now I just don't have a tender. Can I also just say I like I'm not against like Tinder and people who online date but personally if I was ever single, I just don't think that's how I would want to meet someone. Yeah hit the bars hit the bars or the dog park. Yeah, you know Not that I've seen any Daddy's at the dog park, but but that's a natural way to need someone. Yeah, and I also think no Enjoy. Maybe the bar isn't always the best option. Yeah do something like a hobby that you enjoy. Yeah. Maybe it's someone's work out. I put see any time about the oh God meeting people know Jenna's where no, I think if you have a dog and you're single go to the dog park go to all the darts on Daddy's there. Yeah for sure. And usually a little off but whatevs. No, I definitely and I can I can say this like I have a boyfriend but there's definitely some handsome young men at the dog park. Oh, yeah sure and I'm sure a lot of them are single looking for a lady and they have don't hit it up who doesn't love a man with the dog half. The reason all my got happier. Okay. I'll say like point three percent of the reason. I love my boyfriend so much is because he's Golden Retriever and I are essentially a relationship. Yeah Cody has little I don't use my man. Dog, but but but it's a different. It's a place like if he had no animals like I don't know only love you a little bit less but not too too much. Oh, yeah, we had this we had this other girl who she wanted to her who this person is. Yeah. We don't know her name. She did like message. Oh, yeah, so she's just trying to she wants to shout out her her ex boyfriend who cheated on her. We don't know who she is, but gee. She's but we appreciate your content. Yeah, we do like a bear up in Lovin her ex-boyfriend had to dress up as a Playboy bunny and go to Hooters and we're all these different things like and she basically said so my cheating in all caps ex-boyfriend lost a super embarrassing bad for Halloween and someone was kind enough to bless me with all these pics. She sent some pretty amazing photos. I mean obviously seeing a man in a tight pink ones. He's always Amazing and then she just said gotta put that baby carrot on blast. So there it is. She's on blast. She won't let us follow her but I truly hope that we pay for her. Yeah, and we wish her the best she jumped the reason I like the reason we were saying this right now is because she just messaged me and it just said cheating loser of the week. Okay what I'm not really sure about these like dicks drawings. Yeah, I don't think that hitting us. Yeah, I mean like they're they're like they're funny. I don't know how old she is. Maybe we can chat later with her. Yeah, if she yeah, she said she wanted to stay private. I don't know. So maybe she's just not even a real person but it's fine fans supporters supporters. Always we love that not appreciate you. Can we do? All right guys? Well, this is getting a little lengthy. It's so lengthy. I hope you guys listen to this whole thing.

So we wanted to mention a podcast of the week recently Andrea and I have been listening to the young and ambitious podcast by Sienna Marabella and Emily Duong.

Shout out to Young and ambitious podcast.	1.0

Like if it really I think the biggest part that people don't hit enough of consistently is just through the nutrition because if like there are the I've had clients that aren't extremely active. I have a 59 year old client. She was 278 pounds when we first met and she's lost 57 pounds. She's now in like 2:17 to some and for her to do it and she has any issues and she's five two five three this Asian lady. The biggest thing that we just focus on was her nutrition and she countered a calorie she weighed her food out. She kept her diet simple and she was losing weight. You know, we I was she trained with me two times a week and then I had her come and once on the weekend by herself and literally I would just prescribe her 20 minutes of cardio 10 minutes before ten minutes after a little bit of free weights here and there a little bit of machines and over time. It was really the nutrition that guided her to get to where she wanted to be, you know, so I think for a lot of people the nutritional part is hard, you know food is our Escape is definitely my Escape black. I love food, you know, but, you know a little bit of sacrifice like during the week and then you get enjoy yourself on the weekend. I think he's really again all about balance if you have 30 days if you're good, 25 out of those 30 days most likely you'll have results right always tell people Good day of bad eating or one bad day of eating will not hurt you in one good day. Beauty will not help you. It's really just about what are you doing for? The most part right? Don't focus on the little things. What are you doing on the bigger picture? Yeah like that.	1.0
Well, I don't I don't even think it's that I feel like Cartoon Network was is rushing their older shows to end so they can get New Orleans on like I feel like any old show that was on Cartoon Network's offended all forgetting a very important part to what Rick and Morty.	-1.0
Yeah, it's so funny reading some of the comments on my YouTube channel because they're all like saying that I'm running around is like an atheist circle now and it's the actually like complete opposite of that. Like I still have all of my same friends from Junior High and high school and they are like all Christians and I'm kind of the only one that left. left which is kind of what has been so hard about this whole journey is just being like, you know the odd one out and it's just interesting to see like how his like I totally understand like not all Christians at the same and people are like don't just let like a few bad apples like ruin your experience, but I'm like guys like I love my friends like I know that they're not like bad people but I'm just sit like my whole thing is that sometimes the things that they Believe and do and say because of that can be hurtful and I don't think people realize that you know, and I've just like experienced a lot of that with my very conservative Evangelical fundamentalist fundamentalist friends.	1.0

I'm not a liar the fact that you're an atheist. Yeah and like that. I recommend your channel to so many people who comment on my videos because yeah because like you do not at all represent the things that I am opposed to you know, like and I think it goes back to this idea of when I was a Christian and when I would kind of be going Like what you're going through trying to defend gay marriage and like all these things. I was always very analytical of this idea of God and in my head I was like if you're telling me that he's a loving God. I feel like we have to be able to attribute certain qualities to this deity. And so often when you are kind of like the girl to find girls who are living in this Christian bubble who like just read the scripture in her.	-1.0

So basically I jumped in like conditions were pretty much perfect. So two days before on the Thursday the weather it was really hot was like 37 38 degrees here and you know, you sort of thought. It was going to be like that. They would have cooled the race off. And then thankfully it cooled down on Friday. I went from 38 down to about 15 degrees like was crazy and it was raining and windy and so didn't really want that either too cold to win. But then so the of the morning of the race it was cool, but clear and there what was a bit Breezy at the start line and But you really I'd rather be a little bit on the cold side at the start line and and which is you know, so it was perfect at no point did I think I'm too hot and so yeah really lucky in that regard. And so yeah, it took off with the crew. And so this is a lot of people who are listening who are local live in the south Australia area and know the race, so this will Echo a lot. So we've had a bit of rain here. So things were very green. So the whole course looks beautiful this show is awesome. And so lots of you run through lots and lots of farmland and through quite a few conservation parks and everything was just Lush and green and so we and it is just and I really did spend a lot of time really paying attention to the course around me even though I've seen it a lot and I know I'm very familiar with the course. I always try to make a point of being aware of the beauty and of what I'm doing rather than just focusing in on myself too much and being because I find when I focus in too much on my my what's going on in my head I end up falling into a hole and negativity hole. So yeah first I wanted to start out slowly and first 500 meters. I started out nice and slow and then we one of the things we do. In this race, you have to climb a lot of fences like Farm barbed wire fences and stuff. And so on the highest and Trail they have these Styles setup, which is like just a little steps that go over the fence and throughout the hundred case. There's probably dozens. There's so many of them you get so sick of them by the end and it just gets so hard to climb over the fences and it slows your right down and the very end so	1.0

That was me. So yesterday I had to go I went to go get a chemical peel and the gal that that was there. She's like, oh I saw that you were going to do hard 75 did you do it and I'm like, I don't even try I like. I know I announced it and I was like, I'm gonna do this. I'm like gonna jump it and then what is it? Oh heart 75. Oh, it's awful don't do it, but it was basically two workouts a day. You had the E stick to eat like an eating diet of your choice. You had to read a 10-page to 10 pages of a self-help book a day and no alcohol for 75 days if you missed you had to start over so it's like a hardcore. Yeah, it's hardcore. It's like a yeah, it's super hardcore. So I was like am I like I was I was to the point I was like, okay. I'm in a good place. I think I can do this. I'd like to get kind of myself situated and it was like a gave me enough time that I would be done by Thanksgiving. Well, we're obviously Asleep, we're not there in five minutes.	1.0

I'm like still crying over the story. So if you do this, that's just me, you know being a worse but it's just um, it's a varied it's an extremely touching story and it is painful when you lose a staff member. So I'm thinking of so you have this yellow day and and you have this celebration of her life in May but leaving up to that time. What? Some of the things that you incorporate into your day into your way of interacting with your human beings, right one of the things that I'll share mine first and then maybe you could share something that you do is this is a really challenging thing to do. It's surprisingly challenging but as you go about your day and you run into 7-Eleven for your you know Snicker bar, not that that happened to me. I'm just saying, you know, I go in there for nothing but healthy things but you run into 7-Eleven. You and you grab something and you're checking out right? Look that person in the eye. It's really hard. It's a hard habit to get into and when they say, how are you how's your day? You know oftentimes your think I got to swipe my card. There's people behind me and I got to kind of find the right change, but we get in the habit of not looking at people when we talk to them or when we're in front of them. And and when that happens, I mean, I just think it becomes we become more disconnected. Even though we're surrounded by people. And so I think that one thing that can help is to become connected. So it's a habit. I'm trying to get better at and I have you know it Ebbs and flows like sometimes I'm better at it than others, but I noticed that I remember back going back to 9/11. So y'all, you know, I've been on this planet a long time some of you are like, oh, yeah, I was too and that happened. I remember when that happened and it was a very strange. couple of weeks strange and that you know one we didn't see our planes in the sky for a couple of days, but then when you would pass random strangers, I'm going to cry thinking about this but um, I'm getting it together here when you were passed random strangers on the street. They would look you in the eye and smile and and greet you which is very it's very different. If you're in a small town happens all the time. If you're in a large city doesn't happen ever like never nobody talks to you. I mean, you just kind of go about your day or base having their little mental conversations and they're going about their day. But for those two weeks we were connected and we were a kind. derp	1.0

I saw this guy with one leg and one doing things that normal people can't do all want to be and they're just It sparked that interest that made them want to create some adaptive diving here. And these guys have been making equipment for the Special Forces all around the world for a long time. It really could have they make such incredible new Ingenuity equipment that you know, it's just really great to use. I love it that just designed me a set of my own sins. We started this line called The Bionic AF, you know what that means? So the probably got a bionic a offline with short travel easy carbon fiber sins that are super super light and I like them short because I can't maneuver as well anymore with my diving leg my robotic diving leg because it doesn't really Bend at the knee whenever I want it to like you would if you're spinning with your normal leg. And so having these really long freediving sins and bulky scuba Sims makes it harder. So that made these really short wide powerful carbon fiber. Thins that I just amazing and then travel bags you can put all your stuff in a really awesome day say that's perfect for traveling really light really easy to use for me with one hand. So it's just cutting it back to the Simplicity of making diving not so complicated so we can just enjoy it.	1.0
Big fat and gone who's taking this down years ago in John New Haven. I like it years ago in New Haven Connecticut. There was a tree on the green that supposedly a Jesus face on it.

So I gotta say this news about James really took me aback. It felt like there had to be more to the story. So I've been calling emailing texting whatever I can do to get ahold of James and so far nothing. He hasn't even liked one of my tweets, but in all seriousness, I'm not as much bothered that he isn't responding to me. What bothers me is that he's blowing off Sterling it's fine if he changed his mind about investing these things happen, but it feels like At least pick up the phone and tell Sterling that the good news is James wasn't the only one who invested in sandbox Commerce. Okay. Well so Jillian also invested on the show what happened with that? I mean she didn't ghost on you two. Did she know? All right, so she mentioned she would introduce you to her partner Jacob did that end up happening?	-1.0

So the next shitty time of day was the morning and I had a fucking disaster with my son this morning, but Monica send oval new no says preparing breakfast for school because they don't eat it and I have to wake them up lat 1075 frequent commentator says waking them up early when they're young but she has a 16 year old now and the attitude and laziness sucks. I told my son the other day because he was like astonished that he had like slept till 8:00 one weekend day and I'm like when you're a teenager like in college, you're going to sleep to like one. Yeah, I'm gonna blow your mind and it was the best thing in the world doing that.	-1.0
What do you typically do but they might think that you should go through that. My thing is just showing patience, you know, Transformations don't happen overnight and I think for me, it's just trying to challenge them in their weak areas and just keep them accountable drink more water. Like a lot of people don't drink enough water dude for females out there track your water intake at least 90 fluid ounces of water or two-thirds of your body weight and for males you want at least a hundred twenty fluid ounces or two-thirds of your body weight. So a lot of people when they train and I asked how much water they have. They're hella tired in the beginning and I asked how much water in there like I haven't had any water. I just had my coffee right and then if you're if you're sleeping for six to eight hours, you're not having any water then we wake up you go pee you have coffee you have you haven't had water for 10 12 hours possibly and then you try to work out and do cardio and less weights your guests 70% of your muscle is water that you need water. So that's number one. One two, I'll try to help them. Tell them to get a little more rest if they can because that's a big thing. But you know, if they slip I think it from me. I've learned that it's better just to keep showing positive encouragement instead of trying to tear them down. You know, it's kind of like parenting and you don't want to tear people down.	1.0

Yeah and look so we kind of dismayed that decision to go down that path but we definitely had kind of a backup option there. But as I said, but yeah speaking to people from even Newcastle similar sort of thing there be closer to Sydney. So maybe they have some options there but hiring it's just almost taken for granted maybe or at least I took it for granted a little bit, but I guess as a follow-on Are there any other particular difficulties that you kind of face or that maybe we don't we're not aware of being in a couple of city that you faced in Regional areas.	0.0

I'm sorry. I feel like the craziest thing we need to talk about to is Cheryl Cheryl pause that she's got a rivalry with their the principle. That's Brewing. But there's one thing I want to talk about shell first case that we see her at the beginning of the episode. We saw last season that the way they were able to kind of make her think that her brother was alive is that they were they were faking that her brother was still alive, but now we see that she does have indeed the dead body of her brother in her the basement of this house.	1.0

How does this is a know? I said, I wouldn't do this but a little side question when you talk about branding as I mentioned before that you like to get in front of camera, and I've noticed on your website. Everything you're not shy about putting your face and telling people who you are, which I love I love them and I say it all the time to people people buy from people. So, I believe that letting people know who you are and what you're about can only be a benefit in your business. How are you? How does that tie into your branding?	1.0
And then if you have any lines or discoloration, that's not coming off. You could use a pumice stone on that.	-1.0

Yeah, Shirley Ballas let like since you mentioned her I mean I think we should talk about her because anyone who's never met Shirley Ballas this she's a queen. She is a queen not only is she a world-class Ballroom dancer herself. She's on the head judge on Strictly Come Dancing. If I highly recommend that you go to YouTube and start searching for some of her videos with Corky Ballas and some of their dances because they are spectacular.	1.0
I'd recognize it and had I had you as a friend back then maybe I would have realized that I don't think any one of us really felt like we were doing anything for that.

Ali and I say have something nice to say about Valentina for once she's gone. She got eliminated.

Oh, well, I help people become better versions of themselves. And so my occupation is a personal trainer personal trainer for California Family Fitness in Sacramento, but I don't really just look at myself as a trainer. I look at myself as a life coach kind of someone who has more of a therapeutic side. It not just physical. It's not just exercise but it's more about your daily decisions more about your habits. It's more about just trying to become a better version than what you were yesterday just baby steps. So just me being on the sidelines trying to help people coach them Mentor them to be better than they were is an absolute blessing and tell us.	1.0
Yeah, I honestly didn't I wanted to talk about this too and then that segment but I honestly I feel like that's a lie. Like I don't just from what we've seen and how he said his dad never talked to him before all of a sudden you smash his car window and he's ready to open up to you and talk to you and listen to you. It just I don't know. It seems a little far-fetched to me. I don't know if maybe he was just deflecting and didn't want to talk about it or if it really is true.	-1.0
It was I mean, we did definitely clean up a lot and what I liked about the tour as well as we didn't get too comfortable. So every like two weeks we would try to take well actually every night we would take one dance and we would Like that one dance to make sure okay. Are we on sorry. I was in the right spot. Are we on our marks? All right. Let's try to make this better. So every single night we'd have one dance we'd focus on so that that night it would be a good like a good quality number with a right positions and makes you like make sure it's clean. So I think because of that it really helped towards the middle and end of the tour to stay clean because we did try and perfect the dances one at a time instead of like kind of Try to do everything will open the whole show doesn't necessarily work. No, so dedicating one day to one dance really really truly helped a lot. And I think that's that was the key.	1.0

But this takes place after Order 66 where all of the Sith are all of the Empire basically. Is and kills all the Jedi all the Younglings if you remember all the kids and everything and so now you are the main character Cal who survived Order 66 and so you're one of the last remaining Jedi or so you think is it Order 66 like a GU leg or something. Nice. Yeah order 66 was like a bad guy said hey Execute Order 66 and all of these army men are all these Troopers clone troopers. Has ended up killing all the Jedi, you know, so like unexpectedly like a betrayal. That's basically Order 66.	-1.0

Yeah. Yeah the wall running. I feel like I don't think is there were there are certain parts that I've noticed. It's like okay, here's this pipe for instance and it has this flat surface on the side of it now granted you couldn't mantle that but it's like it how long it is unlike this kind of seems like they have real running in it and they just they took it out because exact there's some parts on the map where I'm like that that is clearly a wall running wall, but for some reason it's here and it's just taken out or something. I would like it limited time event. I'll be honest. I'd like it limited time. We're like while running and All jumping we're just you know, everybody had it. You know, I feel like that would be really cool. And I mean maybe even maybe even for solos, you know, if we get solos because the main reason at least this is from the developers themselves the main reason they took it out was because it encourages people to split up but if we're doing solos we don't have to worry about splitting up it would be kind of cool to wall run.	1.0

I mean eventually it's gonna go through into the middle. So, you know, we actually stuff one of the oranges in there and I started stabbing it but it actually it took a bit. It took a fair amount of pressure wouldn't be like, you know, you're not going to someone's trying to stab you with a needle and you put your hand in this course you're going through but it's definitely was really good for her like the needle poke when you're you know, if you're just, you know, touch the patient and all of a sudden they had maybe something on because it actually did bend the needle and he will send it been for me pushing it and I don't know if you saw that I think you're dealing with something else. And yeah, the needle is actually Bent by the end and by the time I went through so they're actually pretty good HEX number gloves interesting.	1.0
We just want to take a second to let you know that if you're thinking of being a millennial like us and starting your own podcast, there is a way you can do your show without having to become an audio editing and production wizard because guess what we don't know shit with that, but we have Alan that pretty easy podcast who helped us get started. He records are shows. He post them he Awesome, awesome music and cool shit, when we don't even know what he's doing. He sends us teaser episodes. He doesn't all we just sit here and friggin talk. We shoot the shit and you can record from home your office the park a bathroom stall at work. It doesn't matter. He provides the complete podcast studio. All you need is a microphone and you're good Alan caters to your schedule and gives you a producer for your show at your beck and call he has been super flexible with our schedule whenever we need him. We were Google Calendar. We just booked him and he does all the hard work. It's like so incredibly easy. That's why it's probably called pretty easy podcast. So be heard and have some fun podcasting like us go to pretty easy podcast.com today.	1.0
Oh all the different changes within that. Basically we thought steric was coming. Oh and you were talking about Alpha con how Dylan was basically drag the show and there was all these things that he didn't know. Yeah, and I was just going to input that there were a lot of leadership changes during that time. But again, we don't know who influenced what and ultimately because Jeff was gone for a minute and I'm pretty sure Jeff was fired for a minute and but it was right at the same time as a like. The crossover where the change in leadership because LJ is Lindsay Jewett Sturman. She was in charge of season 5 for the most part. She took Jeff's notes and then really kind of cobbled that together and then they announced that season six was Jeff's last they got Hall age, which I'm like y'all paid out the but for this and then you know Season 6, so I'm like this wasn't a someone was doing him a favor. That wasn't no you deserve that. That's okay. Finally going to get rid of you. If you want to go out with a bang. That's fine. This is not going to been syndicating Teen Wolf on MTV. It's crazy to me.	-1.0
That doesn't belong for example the other day there was a toy a up there. There are certain things that go up there like a plant framed pictures a key basket, but there's other things that shouldn't you know, glasses there certain things that I allow up there and then certain things that just don't belong up there. So just remove any clutter from your living areas clear off the surfaces and the floors and then of course lastly you're going to want to sweep or vacuum the floors and there. And that's probably going to take the most of your time but it also probably causes the most impact as far as how your house looks having clean floors in your living areas, whether they're vacuumed or swept and mopped can make a huge difference in the appearance of your home. It'll definitely give you that bang for your buck people will be able to tell that you've cleaned, you know vacuuming and dusting is a big thing. So, Most of your time might be on vacuuming or picking up the floors. Most of your time might be spent on that. But since I can talk faster than you can clean. I'll give you some ideas of bonus chores in those areas and perhaps it's a day that you don't need to sweep or vacuum. Maybe your floors already look good some things that you can do are additional dusting. Maybe you need a desk some knickknacks a bookcase a piano. Maybe you have a window to wash - or you know something really occasional like dusting the baseboards. I've talked about this before but an easy way to dust your baseboards is to rubber band a microfiber cloth around the bottom of a broom and then just rub those baseboards or if they have a lot of buildup you might need to use a wipe. Our sponge or something like that and actually, you know you something wet, but if you keep it dusted you can prevent it from getting to grimy other bonus chores in the kitchen living areas.	-1.0

Yes. Absolutely. I agree with you. It's kind of like a Hot Topic right now that a lot of people might hear and not know specifically what it is. So to break it down intuitive eating is a nonlinear approach to health and food and your overall well-being where the fundamental belief is that you are the expert of your own body. And so The traditional Health realm where we're constantly told to look outside of ourselves at the latest, you know Health Trends and gurus and food rules. What's good for you? What's bad for you intuitive eating asks that you actually just tune into the unique messages your body sends you and determine what is best for your health based on what you feel in your own body. So it's going to be different for every single person and again because you are the expert of your own body. Nobody can decide better than you what you really need. It's also a system that really helps restore a more empowered enjoyable and peaceful relationship with food and your body as opposed to having you work against and fight your body all the time and guys.	1.0
But remember that's one time that one time one event next week after week after week, and maybe they are maybe and I'm sure there's a couple dimples that would do it week after week after week. But but for for us, it's not something that work all the way. I'm gonna completely focus on because we have a lot of rodeos and we have a lot of good committees and a lot of people that we do business with that. We that we enjoy, you know, enjoy as well, you know, and we have to have a good set of both for our rodeos. Not just our horses, you know, we we all those committees at a service that's good throughout good quality throughout that's something that we really pride ourselves in here with our rodeo company is We're not yet. I don't want to ever be just label the horse guy or just a bull guy or a guy that has mediocre rough stock and great time today. We try and be full service. We want the best pickup man. The best bullfighter we can get the best book Bronx bareback and Bulls and and even time to be in cattle. We want to be good at it all. You know that I something that that I wouldn't when we first started this one of the one of the guys that I've Has looked up to that I've always thought had excellent stock throughout was Sammy Andrews Sam. He's always had good bulls and good horses. He wasn't just a bull guy or just a horse guy. It's so and that for me. That's not my want to pride myself in this being a Stockman not just one one one sided because at the end of the day those guys paid their entry fees to they need they deserve a decent shot, you know, so he's so leading into the to the 2019 season.	1.0

Oh, yeah, so so no I so I got this degree and and I you know, and I part of me feels like it was worth it. You know, I don't feel like I learned a ton of production in school, but the experience which I'm still paying for the experience itself was all worth it how to live on your own how to meet people. I met my wife there at school in class like the old school way, which is awesome. Thank you. So I thought at that point, you know, Mike Was to move out here and I was still sponsored in snowboarding. I was writing for a couple different companies. So I'm just going to move out here and figure it out. I don't have a job when I'm moving out here. So my girlfriend the time now my wife we packed up my car. We drove all the way across the United States. Tell Tom how long of a drive is that too long? It was a knife.

Yeah. Nothing lasts indefinitely. Yeah. It's certainly not something for the next three of five years and I don't think it's something that we could and should expect within the next 10 years or something. But I could be wrong. I mean one thing that creates me because the whole doll system creates problems of its own and the problems themselves might get out of that. It's not sufficient that the current crop of politicians and central banks and so on that they are knowledgeable and that they are relatively discipline. So they don't exaggerate the practice of helping themselves with the printing press because there are other problems that are resulting from the current monetary system that we have. The most important ones being that is the lack of responsibility of the dear responsible ization and of the of the financial markets on the one hand and the the consumption of capital on the other hand. Okay. Let me be the first one is probably this needed that I explain this to you and to your audience because you're probably aware of this right that simply if you know that you have some something like a backstop that comes Through the printing press Yahoo! Central Bank behind you or the Central Bank the sues the mission of stabilizing the financial Market well, and it does so with the printing press then this amounts to a socialization of a part of your risk. So as a consequence risk taking as rule is always on. All right, so you get very from oil you valuation of shares and other asset classes and so on and you get equally enthusiastic use of Leverage. I had to do to get the results that you need at least in the short time. I saw the economy is moving on a on a did path. Right and this makes the whole thing very fragile and it's like some sort of apology. So we are with this connection. I believe this is quite obvious. The other problem that I mentioned is capital consumption all that that's less less obvious. Probably and what I have here in mind is that thanks to the printing press you no longer. You destroy a part of the incentives that push people to say, of course, you reduce the intent of to become self-reliant. It's only good food. I've been so on especially you reduce the incentive to save as a consequence. You are diminishing the capital base right now in real terms of the economy. Now the question is how strong is this effect? If you look at the official figures you might think well, it cannot be that strong because we still have increased of capital. Vested in real terms. I looked at the figures as found its true. So this is this is the impression that you get but then of course you also know that governments try to manipulate the figures themselves. And especially in this case the price inflation rate review. You are probably aware of the work of John Williams Shadows dance dados dad's right? So I've been following this for 15 years ago fascinating when I saw this, Because what he's doing is just providing estimates right is no because you don't have the raw data. He's just out of his own experiences just estimating the deviation between the calculated inflation rates with the current methodology and the inflation price inflation rate. That would be calculated with the prevailing methods in the 1980s. So he comes up with differentials of about 7% I think right right now right seven seven nine percent. Sometimes this is Its enormous it's just mind-boggling. So I read through macro economic statistics information about Capital Investments. And so on in the light of his figures and my conclusion was that if you if Williams in is right, then we have been consuming Capital concept is since the mid-1980s something like this and even if he is not entirely right, but it's only half right there probably will be consuming capital for the past 20 years in	-1.0

Yeah that you know, he had that pack had that thing that some people have like when they walk into a room there's a magnetic energy that he just, you know, sort of sucks the air out of the room and then after you know, We all found out we got it and I think he was staying at Harlem at the time but his mom's and then they started bringing us in like the rehearsal process and that sort of thing. That's when we started getting cool and but Park was Park which is a one of one-of-a-kind do really really smart way more book reading people give him credit for and then you know, once we started the filming process man, we just Got tight and got cool and it was it was all New York. So, you know cats was trailers was getting ran up in and robbed and it was all type of stuff happening around the filming process because it was still old New York and no I remember going uptown with him to you know, go to his mom's crib and met her and he was a good dude, and he was told he was recording his first album at the time so I have fond memories of like in between Takes all the you know lunch break. He'd be like yo o run up being I'm run up in the trailer and he would be spitting around to me and I'm like, oh, what's that fool? And he was like, oh, I'm gonna do this song blase blase bar, and I've told her story once before but I remember with this is when I really sort of Genius apart one day we came to set and he was reading the papers and some woman had through her baby in the incinerator, right? That's a horrible thing, but sadly grown up in New York at that time. That was normal to hear like you heard stuff like that all the time and park was so affected by like it was messing with him the whole day and I'm like, oh it was like whatever and same thing happened at lunch. Call me in the trail. Yo, he starts spitting this verse and I'm not putting two and two together now months later when the first album come out and I saw Brenda's Got a Baby. I was like, oh shit, that's the joint that and it but I saw the whole process and I was like, oh, yeah, he did.	1.0

Yeah, I don't I don't love it. I like it more as like I think like a second place to go to like if I drop near it. I might go there and like okay nobody's been here or somebody has but maybe they had to drop something. I don't know so I don't like it to be my very first drop but every once in a while some of the You know, they'll be the jumpmaster and they'll be like, alright, we're going to Bunker and I'm like, all right, I do have to admit. I had one of my coolest coolest kills there because you have to tell me. Yeah, I dropped into a bunker bunker. I dropped into it. I want to say it was on the west side. So the one with like the kind of the archway or whatever and then the the two or three boxes there so I dropped. On that side and I dropped in a there. There's a bluff Honda. He's right there and I'm like, oh no no, no, she's gonna get me. I mean, I'm dead. I like I like in my mind. I had already given up here, you know, I was like, you know what? I'm not going to go down without a fight. So I just started hitting him hitting him over and over again and they're just like kind of running around like like they're brand new player in the like what's going on what's going on? And so finally a finished him off with a flying kick or whatever then all of a sudden I hear the gunfire from my teammates. Are somewhere else on like okay, I gotta grab something grab something and grab something and then I think I came up behind a couple of people and got them ended up getting knocked a little bit later, but it was like that rush or whatever. That was just like yeah, I'm not going down without a fight and I definitely didn't think it was gonna work because they actually got a gun and so they shot but it was a most home Peak. So the shot three times miss me two of them. So it was kind of crazy so number. Nine is going to be relay and relay. I felt like was a pretty good choice because I really like the wetlands. So whether or not you jump or you drop at Wetlands, like maybe you weren't quite able to get it to relay, but the good thing is that there's that redeploy right there. So regardless of where the circle is with that redeploy dropping there's really cool because you can kind of just take your time.	1.0

Yeah. So for to give you a little back story I was a Bull rider not a very good one. I wrote both, you know through high school and college and instead started and I guess I bought my Pro card in 96 anyway, and I rode around and got on lot of balls on the west coast. What it what had happened is I do to getting beat up and Andrew and stuff. I kind of had to give it up yum. I was only 25 or 24 when I quit But I threw getting on a lot of bulls out here on the West Coast. I became friends with Don Kish and getting on his balls all the time and go to go into their rodeos when I got beat up real good. The last time I guess 99 there. I he he called me when I was in the hospital and get offered me a job to come out and weld for it. Well, I was beat up and like I said, he beat up enough to where I can. I couldn't do too much like couldn't lift too much or do too much buddy buddy called and we had been like I said friends before need any dawn said would you like to come home and and weld for me? I'm trying to build this feed lots of these bulls. And and all I had to do is set in well, you guys are probably familiar with putting up pipe and cable fins. And and so I just had to set there and weld them the Milliron on the post to run the cable through and so on that that winter I came or well, I got hurt at Fort Worth. So it was about this time of the year anyway, and that came home and welded for dog. Well, anyway, it evolved into going to work for he and John crowning and and I work for the rodeo company therefore started in 99 and started, you know, discontinued helping Dawn with bulls and then really started getting involved with the horse part of it. You know while working for the rodeo company and then No.5 John offered me an opportunity to buy into the company and by the horses from the company which Saudi I did definitely at the time they they provided the horses and Don had two bullets on the ground. Right? Right. That's exactly right. So John own on the horses and then Dawn on the Bulls and then John also on the time of in cattle. I guess. That's anyway. and so through working around there for four or five years there and I started flanking the horses I guess and probably like oh three and then again just got an opportunity there and bought the horses and oh five and and then kind of well, I don't want this to sound wrong. But you know the horse program when I bought it and I'll five it was it was struggling, you know, there was I think there was a couple or three maybe horses going to the final and and and not a real real and I don't want this to come across like I'm saying anything derogatory. I'm not I'm not I'm just kind of trying to lay out the facts the breeding program. For the horses wasn't real organized. You know, there was kind of not sure what calls were out of what two mares. You know, there was some paperwork loss. You know, it's kind of a oh, yeah Club not a real not a real organized situation and not hey and not to say that I don't feel have some hiccups here and there today. I'm just saying, you know five it was in there was a lot of I did all the information wasn't there. But anyway, So then what I did is, you know first thing I did when after buying the horses sorted up the mayor's kind of got the you know, the mayor's that I thought were the best Mayors and certainly as we all know if you raise bucking stock you the ones you think that are the best at the you know, your first year or two into it, maybe they're not the best and and and then the one that you're that you don't breed all the sudden, you know later on you wished you kick yourself in the butt and think gosh. should have been breeding them are you know, she she was at first maybe wasn't the shiniest one in the herd, but you know, they stay hooked and they stay you know, they just stay solid and today that's the one thing I've learned now being, you know, whatever 13 years 14 years into this but one thing I have learned is the ones that are solid and consistent for me the mayor's that do that seem to be the ones that raised the better horses the that they've The Bucks in them. They're just they maybe aren't the most talented but they give it to you every time they might only be in 1819 pointer. But if they do that out of her time, that's probably in my experience that's you know, only 13 14 years into this pretty Limited in the horse industry because you know, you think of them other guys, I was talking about earlier. Oh, yeah, you guys that there's there's like guys like a cork. Oh they've been doing this 50 50 years, you know, so so when I talk about 13 or 14 Teen years. I might my experience is a little bit limited compared to those guys obviously, but in my limited amount of time here going back to what I thought the solemn are the ones that just give it to you what they what they can every time and and do something every time 1819 Point hoppers for me. Those have been the ones that have been the best moms, you know, and I don't know why that is. I wish I had a magic ball to look into and figure out why that is but But you know the the the ones that jump out there and just make your mouth water rank as hell one time. And then the next time maybe aren't as shiny. They the consistency it for whatever reason that that genetic trait of consistency doesn't doesn't carry on to their you know, their Colts have that same enemy. You know what they're just not consistent in any way so that send the Colts out of those.	-1.0

No doubt, and the thresholds do matter but also know thing that matters and apparently Brian could conceive the same way is the res a relative Athletics for only one draft pick did not meet the elite threshold for that last year. That was cool Madison. We look at guys like Kendall diners and Mark was veiled is scamming Equity me saying Brown if they were Elite athletes, they were some of the best of the best at their pro day at their combine whatever and I think that does play a part with how he's guys read the the team drafts whether it is because of the pure athleticism that Baby, he reads the math bomb Twitter or he just has it own stuff that he goes on the pet. The Packers have an act like you said to draft spectacular athletes. And another good example is Oren Burks. He tested through the roof and jumped into the third round conversation could be starting at inside linebacker this year. So the RAS also plays a big part and I guess what did you see from that as far as how that factors in?	1.0

Eh has always a good age. And so I was living in Beverly at the time and I was like sort of talking to this guy and like this is a common theme every girl in their life has a crush on a drug dealer. Every girl maybe not you Taylor. You're a good person. Everybody has a thing for one at least. Well, not are you talking like selling weed or selling? Oh, yeah just weed. Well Cody did that all throughout College. Sorry to put you on blast, but mommy we got to do that sometimes so kind of do like you can't always file your taxes with your true income.	1.0
So yeah. Again, my name is Sterling Smith, and I'm the founder and CEO at sandbox Commerce. So so so for four years ago, I decided to leave my my career at a management consulting firm to start sandbox Commerce. So my friend said what the hell are you doing? I had a pretty comfortable potential. It is stay there for the next 20 years for the next 20 years, but I kind of already saw the glass ceiling so I could tell that you know, my limit my options were limited working for that for that company so I decided all right, so Sterling's a little rocky out of the gate, but the story he sharing is your classic entrepreneurial Journey.	1.0
So we got to have them attorneys dead man present why they sign an issue Brooke because it's probably still going on.

She like yo, we want our own, you know, say we want our own Manager and stuff like that. Why would you know, why would we want to you know use somebody from your management company to manage us because they only know how your company and you know, you know best and best interest in mind, you know and not have our best interests in mind and that's how a lot of people get jerk. Could they just so eager to say yo we on we on don't say I play my song on the radio and then when you look up the biggest selling group, you know saying in pretty much R&B female R&B history ended up 50,000 today name, you know say after that record sold millions of copies.

Yeah, exactly. I know other don't worry part of you is like, I've got a marathon to go that sucks. But then I was like no don't let that throw. It's a marathon yet only a marathon and but yeah and at that point, you know, you're starting to cross paths with more people. It was and then so I grabbed another at drop bag with some more food in it. And the next there's about 18 kilometres to checkpoint for and it checkpoint for I had my buddy run. I was coming on to join me for the last sort of 27 on ches. That was Aaron Cole batch and Aaron, it was great. So I sort of push through checkpoint to checkpoint for and you go through this section. It's my favorite part of the whole race even though about kilometer. He or the high 60s you're going up through what's it called Mount magnificent and into the fitness Conservation Park and it's just the so pretty through there like its Farmland at this is beautiful farm houses nestled in amongst these like really spectacular Rolling Green Hills. It is and the kind of Rocky, but they're also really green. It's just lovely and I really focused on Deserving that but also I focused on again anytime I could run I would run out hit the hills if it was a hill I would be if I was walking I was power hiking like I was really just wanted to keep my time to get my legs moving. And so I was at managing to power like it under 10 minutes per kilometer, which I was happy with so not nice work. Yeah pretty quick. There were people quicker than me at that. But you know, and at this point, I'd Fallen back a few places, but I sort of was focusing more on. And what I was doing and not worrying too much about the race itself and just worried about my own race. And then so again to check point for which was glorious and I for the first time I thought I'm gonna have a little sit-down at checkpoint for for a few minutes and that's that was my little reward for being very efficient through the previous age stations. It's at this point you at 77 km/h know you've really sort of broken its back and I Saw My Buddy Aaron and it was just you know reinvigorated me and it was funny though. My brain was getting a bit muddled as it is kind of now and I went to take something out of my back. My back was the first time I'd taken my pack off as well. I took my pack off briefly or took something out and I just somehow everything fell out of my pack and like I just had my shit everywhere and it's like I don't know how to put this back in and it's like I've been people laughing at me and And she's a really good atmosphere there and everyone just friendly and I got it all back in probably spent longer there at the age station that I really wanted to but you know it is what it is and it just some you know, it was not that was not part of the plan. But then with Aaron she just can't be honest and kept me running when I could run and made sure I kept sipping fluids and eating a beer and like it was a turn into a beautiful afternoon. Coming into the last sort of you come into kaipo forest from the last sort of twenty five k's and it's a pine Plantation. And so all right. Yeah. So pine trees everywhere. We've got a nice sort of feel and one going between farmland and pine plantations and like really I didn't have any like spectacularly low moments. I just I feel like I mean I was at low power low ish points, but I just was able to manage those low points better than I have in the past. So I'm really happy about that. And so my goal was always initially my main goal. I wanted to get under 12 hours, but I knew that was off the off the Record like 12 hours is pretty lofty goal one day one day one day but my next goal was to beat the Sun and so I thought I can still do that. So I had to do about under 13 hours to do that and I came into there's only nine kilometers between checkpoint four and five and I remember coming and so it's really nice short break. I grabbed a sat down had a ginger beer at checkpoint 5 didn't try to see there too long stuffed in some noodles. What took them on the go and I ate some of them and then had to ditch the rest because it was just getting a bit too hard to eat and I remember I had a what happened next? Yeah, then the last sort of 10 kilometers. Yeah, sad to feel a bit nauseous and then you know, but kept positive Aaron made me laugh and I was trying to high five as many volunteers and Spectators that I saw a long anyway, and then coming into the forest. I know the course really well the final and I actually from previous year. I had a landmark point where I knew. There was one kilometer to go but somehow this year I went past that last kilometer to go Mark and didn't notice and then I came around the other shit. The Finish Line was right in front of me was like just straight up by 200 meters and so some like always and I always was like somewhere I was able to leg it for the last couple of hundred meters and I managed to finish without using my head torch and not needing it probably if I was out for another 10 or 15 minutes. I would have had My head towards yeah, but I didn't need my head towards cross the line in 12 hours and 48 minutes and I'll start. Yeah, well, that's brilliant. Yeah, it's good.	1.0

I know it's a lot but but you know what? It's so common now, it's one of those like, oh, I have anxiety who have anxiety. I have depression. You have depression who like right is it is it you have a mental illness and I really love just that there is such a spotlight on it right now. I mean, I I have always gosh my parents got Divorced when I was we moved here to st. Louis when I was in third grade my parents got divorced when I was in fourth grade and that was a pretty ugly divorce. And so because of that my parents had put me in counseling with my brother. So I was used to that concept and then I went through high school and my dad was diagnosed with ALS and that just whole concept of watching my dad died for 18 years that was a lot but in the middle of that I kind of I was always the kid who had To do all the things I mean the old the oldest so I always felt the need to always be have be perfect and get good grades and Achieve and do all the great things - Sports because I suck at Sports and basically I went to college had a awful breakup with a boyfriend and I just kind of went off the deep end. I was I would say I can't quite remember two years of my life and rightfully so and that's that. My twin just the combination of my dad and that that break up like we were going to get married. It was like a whole thing. Like we were we were there and going I switched schools and like it just all kind of like whoo One Time Hit me and at that point my parents were like, okay, it's time like we need to talk to somebody you need to go see somebody and I started seeing a therapist and a weekly basis and I was diagnosed with anxiety PTSD from my parents divorced. From fourth grade which always seems kind of strange but I guess yeah, they're the experts there and it was recording of my Apple watch was recording that and so I started seeing by somebody and we talked and I we did we I went every week and like they would give me things to work on or things so and I was medicated at that point. I think I was on two different medications and I felt good and I felt like I was starting to like get the tools that Did to like handle my situation and and then kind of calm myself down when I was, you know, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They actually were able to help me give me extra time for taking tests and things like that at school because I would just get so overwhelmed that I could like put I wouldn't even take the test. I would just sit there and like fries. Yeah, which then made my last two years of college extremely difficult, right? And but then it was one of those really crazy things that I met my husband. Well, it was my seen my super senior year of Cool, super super semester my life physical senior plus like the extra semester and I met Jeff and it was one of those things that like, I don't know if it was just our yin and yang - of our personalities. He was able to just come in and be a really great kind of source of balance and understanding for me and slowly over that first year of us dating. I wean myself off of all of the medication that I had been on now people would be like, oh that's probably not the best idea but for He understood like where I was coming from and he knew my whole background and he was like he was in favor. Whatever I needed to do. Yeah, but he definitely wanted to make sure that one he could be as part of a because he could be in our relationship and so I have not been on medication since then but up until now I have recently started well in the last year or so. I started going back to a therapist just with Hattie going back to school and trying to figure out life and what's next for me in terms. Of the crazy world and just my role as a blogger and an influencer how that's changed. I get a lot of anxiety from just being a blogger. Yeah. So being on Instagram all the time feeling like you always have to be on and feeling exhausting for an extroverted interview. Yes. So exhausted. I'm feeling like you always have to have something fresh and new and that are going to get people excited to see what you're doing that day. That's A lot and then the flip side of that is if you would if you think you post something that's so you think you work so hard you did so great and then it tanks and it's like right. Well, you know, maybe I'm a failure or what's going on and then then there's days where like or I get a comments or I get like a series of things happen. I'm also really bad about like collecting all of my feelings and then exploding. Yeah. So that's also a whole nother conversation for another day, but it's I could basically like have a comment that will trigger me and then I Disappear for like a couple of days and and I just don't want to deal with like the world. But here I am. I've selected a profession that makes me forward facing to the world, but I'm human so it's kind of hard like it's it's a lot. So yeah, so I mean I find it helpful to you go to a therapist now I do so, but I feel like sometimes I find it helpful like we just sometimes we have nothing to talk about and like and those are the days I don't you. I have the same situation you go in and having nothing to talk about and then like some ugly yucky stuff. Just yeah boils up from the bottom and you're like where did that come from?

So I like it when it's nice and quiet. So I do a lot of writing on the outskirts of town and along the dirt roads and things like that and you have a favorite course out there or do you just pick something different every day? What I am a creature of habit. I do have my few different routes that I do that my favorite. Is this the Buddha chill illegal trial, which is hardly anyone seems to know about but it's a beautiful little The trail part of the seemingly multiples went along there, but it's nice that you I never see anyone there. It's beautiful. It's undulating. You can see Mount French lie because of the distance of most of its shaded which is unusual for around here. So that would probably be my favorite I can if I start from home you can do that 30 case I suppose those trails. And then next next year I'm going to do the 200 bomb idiotic. Well, maybe the plan. Various lists the various. Wa very nice. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, beautiful try. I'm terrified about Well, I can't say I saw Iran maybe 60 or 70 case on that trail last year. And in that time I think I saw three or four snakes are quite a while snakes on that trial. But yeah, I see a lot of things here.

So someone said to me once which I never forgot was that branding isn't just about your logo on your website. It's actually about you you the brand of your business and people want to see you. And they want to hear your story and they want to see how you can transform and that room from a vacant to a beautifully stubbed property. So I like I've not always been game enough to put my face onto Instagram stories. It's just something that I realized that people I actually got a lot more traction when I was being real and honest on camera, and I'm not shy to show the warts and all of home staging it isn't just about that beautiful. Sad room at the end of the day and I yeah, I think people really appreciate that but also in such a small Regional area. I think it's it's really good to put your face out there as well because people then just build that trust with you and your brand I guess. Yep couldn't agree more.	1.0
You know, it's fun. Yeah, but there's always photos and park on and I feel like since parkrun photos. It's just like it's just every Saturday you get like an abundance of all my running friends are posting pictures of their parkrun photos. And I mean, I don't know I'm all for like sharing your running in that but I do Think you know, how many photos do we need to see if the same track it doing the same thing and I don't want to criticize Parker. It's just funny how many we get you get the same parkrun photos every week and it's just like my feed gets flooded you park on yeah.	1.0

Let me watch as a child. I never scart. I was scarred somebody enriched as well. And so when Terminator 2 like the big SQL is coming out as like I couldn't wait to see it. So I actually went with my parents and sod and the movie blew me away, you know, not just in terms of visuals, but in terms of the storytelling like the story structured in such a different way that I'd never seen before like you want to talk about, you know blowing Minds wide open like that's what happened to me to the point where R. That was when I first like picked up like one of the one of the movies I think there's a movie magazine called Premier that I used to read. And that's when I started picking up that kind of stuff and looking into what actually went on behind the scenes to bring that to everybody and that's when I realized like I think I think I have some stories. I want to tell I like I want to like make something I want to put it on the screen you were enriched and obviously all this beautiful picture you were engulfed in the magazine.	1.0

And it's called crawlers are Subterranean Predators with insatiable appetites that are that are the result of their height and metabolisms. They are both solitary and pack Hunters one can kill a big buffalo on its own and they can cooperate to take down more powerful creatures such as calm and being some training and nature skull crawlers are capable of using their limbs to burrow deep into the Earth and they seem to have mostly mostly a primal mindset and they are highly aggressive so practically hostile As well as incredibly persistent in pursuing their prey. They do have however show some degree of intelligence shown when the skull devil the largest of the skull crawlers with refuses to devour somebody armed With Grenades and simply swats a person away school colors are very are very durable as they can withstand bullets from rifles and even the Searing heat from a flamethrower and the alpha skull crawler was only dazed when calling slammed his head with a boulder or smashed his face with a tree branch and they have incredible. More stamina because they're able to stay in a full-fledged fight for several minutes. Even while being incredibly injured and the skull crawler appear to be actually more intelligent than the others and this was seen and this received because he appeared only ones calling was subdued and it all and and its colors possess possess accelerated metabolism, which causes them to live in constant constant starvation, and this is shown when the skull devil ravenously tried to eat neither and refuse to let go of Congress arm and calm down turned his appetite. Against it did tearing out its tongue and other internal organs and had it often and had it let go it would have in fact survive as Congress holding Weaver and adults colors tongue. Now, I'm going to say to say what their role was in the film. It's called crawler was stirred. It was first seen feasting on on a dead squirrel Buffalo by Kong and called was about to confront the creature when he was ambushed by a second skull crawler after a lengthy battle called it Kong ends up subduing and killing both skull crawlers by Smashing one skull with a devastating Stomp and the other by stuffing its head into the ground breaking its neck. And another skull crawler ambushed Jack Chapman and a Spore mantis, but I went for Chapman and ate him alive while the sport management mantis managed to escape and that same and that very same skull crawler. Then showed up in the Boneyard and regurgitated Chapman's remains and this was actually normal behavior because the because the skull crawler wasn't being sick. It was just getting rid of the indigestible stuff and when William Randa attempted to make his camera work, he was devoured by it and he then it and then tried to attack the	-1.0

Now we get to find out what happened over the summer that pretty much nobody spoke to him. Hmm.

Yeah, so that really ties to a lot of the research that we've been doing over the last three years on what we call mega-projects mega-projects find US capital intensive projects that require multiple teams pull off and they usually in excess of a billion dollars that we've seen have created lots of stress on the industry and on stakeholders within the industry owners designers. And and contractors and what we mean by you know, those the challenge for those projects being business-driven is going to take a large NFL stadium. For example, we have some sort of deadline that we've established for the stadium open probably based on kickoff of game one a couple Seasons from now and so we've got to figure out how to pull together the capital and power the contractor to the designed to get that accomplished within a another find window not necessarily. Taking the other crochet if we were going to build a structure like this, logically and efficiently, how long would it take? You know, we may be three season from now that that Stadium would logically be open and could be built in a way that the the labor market could provide sufficient labor. The contractors could do sufficient planning. The designer would have enough time to thoroughly designed the building to the extent that it's ready to be constructed by a contractor. It's the business pressures and that's just one example, you can apply that to really any project where there's a economic outcome a reason why they're every every project as an impetus for being constructed and if it's a private project because the return on investment the people are looking for if it's a public project is that there's a public use right and and those deadlines are driven by really the reasoning behind them project and that's very well understandable, but I think some of those deadlines of expectations but the public eye and from a business TenPoint have outstripped the capacity the construction industry to deliver on those expectations. And that's where we really see challenges. So back to the stadium example, we want to build a stadium in two years great. We don't have the local label Market to support it. We don't have time to pull the design together and we would stress the contractor Community to build it but we're going to try to do it anyways and roll the dice and see what happens and sometimes when you see favor welcomes, but more and more on these large projects. We are seeing unfavorable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.	-1.0

I just have to fit around my daughter and my work as best as I can that are generally I'll do I do a lot of longer. ER well what I call mid-length runs so often I'll do a 20K run in the morning and then in the afternoon, I'll do strength training and all be fishing on the treadmill at the gym because I can take my daughter with me to cut. It has a bit of a muck around with the other cubes. And yeah, so that's right on the weekends. I usually do a longer run as well as I can but even so my long runs on the weekends.

He has a Google document with the Packers threshold along with draft prospects and whether they made them whether they visited with the team with their combine measurements were and what they can possibly bring to this team.

So this has Sterling would say he is the honey when a customer uses a Retailer's app. Sandbox Commerce is able to collect data about those customers for the retailer. The assumption is of course that this will help them better Market to these customers Amazon for example has an insane amount of data on people's buying habits and they use it to sell more stuff. But if you're a retailer that sells on Amazon you don't get access to that info Amazon Hogs that sweet sweet data for themselves now you Sandbox, Commerce retailers will have their own little stockpile of data. What does that do for them?	1.0
Yeah, and if you guys have the time Ross juggling did a fantastic study put together a Packers big bored and he did it pretty much based off the RS for the most part. It's a great read go check it out. And then she said TV, but essentially the relative athletic scores just me. They are comparing athletes for the last 30 or so years. There's a specific year that this dates back to kentley Plaid on Twitter at math bomb to the fantastic fantastic job of putting all this data together and he does it I believe for free. I don't think he gets any money for it, but it's basically a formula that he's arrived and a model and he just puts these numbers out. And what it does is it Compares Compares players relative to other players of their position using their size the height their weight, they're all their testing scores and just kind of puts out what percentile athlete they are in comparison to the rest of the players that were at that position for the last x amount of years. So every single year, it gets more it gets stronger and better indicator of what type of athlete that you're dealing with. With and it's just it's such a great tool and and we're blessed to live in the 21st century.	1.0
I don't spray the kids shower curtain that often because I use kind of a cheap one. And a lot of times we have it closed which allows it to air out.

Being in charge is a big deal. It is not an easy task. When you're in charge of a group of people your job is to lead them that can mean guiding people showing them the way making sure everyone's doing what they're supposed to be doing. You might have to give orders or remind people that they have to follow certain kinds of rules. And when you're in charge you have to make sure everything's happening to keep people safe and happy whether On a boat in a kitchen and a restaurant or through the entire country switch you're brushing to the bottom of your mouth and brush your molars in the way back. I'm speaking from experience here because I Rachel the Choppers lady. I'm in charge of chompers and I'm sort of in charge of all of you Champions. Well, I have to make sure that every morning and every night. There's a Choppers episode for you to listen to so that you chop Ian's never miss brushing your teeth. And part of my job is to remember to tell everyone to switch your brushing to the other side of the bottom of your mouth ambushed her front teeth, too. So you brush all of your teeth and not just so now that we know what it means to be in charge of a group it's time to make a choice which of these people is not in charge of a group the president of a country the chef of a restaurant or the captain of a boat are You have to come back to Choppers tonight to find out until then rinse with water before you leave to one.	1.0

And if someone's meant to encounter God in a specific way that will be taken care of with or without you harping on the person and actually it's probably less likely to happen if you are harping on the person so just like it's like they could go and they could be showing so much of like, what is it like what day want to like show the person of like if they say that they have God inside of them. It's like are they really showing that because right, you know, a lot of the Christians, you know, people want nothing to do with them because they're so mean and so it's like why would we want your God if like this is what he looks like in my core. I think I fundamentally think we as Humanity are intrinsically good and and I know that like a lot of Christian teaching is that like we're intrinsically evil, but I guess I was just kind of encourage people to step away from I'm like necessarily putting that on all of humanity. Like I don't know. I'm just so positive and I'm so optimistic and like I know there are so many bad things in this world, but I feel like they're always met with like an overwhelming amount of love and support that shows like the goodness of humanity. Like for example, the Orlando nightclub shooting that happened, you know, that was like horrible, but after that Like there were so many people lined up to donate blood and I think just like recognizing that that we are like capable of doing so much good and and focusing on that and then also recognizing that people are so much more than a label like there's so much more than a single word or a single defining term and if we can accept people and like truly accept them. For who they are and not try to change them. I think will realize that it's okay to disagree because those labels don't Define who a person is like I don't Define you by your Christian faith, like you're someone who is fighting for Change and promoting love and acceptance and kindness and equality and those are things that I agree with so if we can focus on what we have in common instead of what divides us, I think, you know, we can you know, Live in a much better world just recognize that the people like your enough like your enough just being you. I don't know like I just feel like like it's in us like we're just good. Well, thank you so much for this conversation. It was awesome.	1.0

Alright, so If you guys don't know already if you've watched any favorite TV shows like Simpsons family guy Futurama American Dad. I don't know if they really predicted anything. Yeah stuff like cartoons. Yeah older cartoons. Yeah, all these cartoons and all these shows have actually had an addiction to something that happened in the future a couple years after the show like that episode as are Simpsons they think the creator of it is a time traveler, which would make sense. He's predicted like 18 to 20 things. And hold like life work like doing it. One of the biggest ones was the Mitt Romney thing where he was trying to vote for Obama and it kept going it was the machine that kept voting for Mitt Romney. There's that one. They predicted 9/11 early so that it was that they are becoming president. Yeah, that one they predicted 16. No. Yes, 16 years. They had the exact same place. He was at like as it was happening all the other thing they predicted which was really interesting was the God particle. I don't know if you guys know that one, but they had like Homer Simpson was writing on a board and he had I guess it was really close to the exact equation that was used to Sorry for the actual God particle, and I don't know how I don't know about me. But you put that together that if it says that close to the God particle, you might have you might be thinking something. You know what I mean? Like it's not part of God Particle because I have no idea.	1.0

I mean there were so many different aspects of it. You know, one of the aspects was this idea. Like I started viewing Christianity differently and I know a lot of Christians will probably disagree with this interpretation, which is totally fine. I just think it's important to realize that there are a lot of people out there. There who will hear the gospel message and they'll interpret it in kind of the way that I started seeing it and it's not necessarily always healthy because I remember looking back and you know asking myself like why I could never bring myself to get baptized even though so many people encouraged me to do it and I think part of me subconsciously disagreed with this idea of like dying to yourself like this. Idea that you are your intrinsic self needed to die that there wasn't anything like good about you. Unless God was living in you and you were reborn as Christ and it just seemed so hurtful to me and like looking back now. I don't think I ever felt broken enough to need a savior. My self-image wasn't bad enough like my life wasn't shattered enough for me to view myself. Business like dirty rags that God Compares artworks to in the Bible and this just kind of made me see how religion doesn't work as well. If you start out with a healthy amount of self-worth because then when I was going through harder times in life, I remember thinking how easy it would be to like go back to church and to feel better and you know, there would be so many people who would instantly care about And it give me attention and support and comfort me and try to make me feel better. And that was so appealing but it made me realize how this idea of God and religion could so easily be used as a Band-Aid like for our problems. It made me feel like religion was like preying on the weak and in those vulnerable moments, like it's so easy to want a savior, but I needed to like pull myself back into reality and be like Intellectually, though. This doesn't add up in my head. So like I don't know. I didn't want to take the easy way out and just like go back and then oh gosh, like there's just so much of out of this is how I felt but it's like you're not capable of anything without God and everything good is because of him and everything bad is because of you and like he deserves all the glory and you're just a vessel completely worthless without him and Like if you leave God your life will be miserable. And that's what I was always told and that's I think what really hurt me afterwards like when I was like, I don't believe this anymore like but people are still telling me like he needs to be the priority in your life. And like if he's not bad things will happen to you and like yeah this one time. Yeah like this one time my friend. I was telling her that I had filled out this job application and it was a writing application. So I had to write like a ton of like not essays but like a lot of prompts and then I hit submit and my internet had gone out and it got all deleted and instead of just being like yeah, that sucks like, you know the internet but she was like wow God is really trying to get you back and in my head I'm like God is going out of his way to like make my life miserable so that all come back to him like that doesn't make any sense. Like, how do you I don't know how can you think that way because that just sounded like manipulation.	-1.0
I don't know but I hope that you're able to take some time to be honest with yourself. Be patient with how God is working in your life. And remember that if you allow God to work in your life he can he has the ability. To work in all things for good for those who love him. Right. Allow God to work in your life. Give him the space to work in your life. My prayer is that. we can all be honest with ourself surrender these frustrations surrender our control give it all to God and that he will encourage us to step in obedience even in the smallest things. I hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I am. I'll talk to you guys soon. Peace out.	1.0
I think it so I have a 20 year old 15 year old and 11 year old now the you know, I think any parent, you know the for the first thing you want your kids to be safe, right, you know, then you want them to feel loved and then you want them to learn right and to learn to teach themselves. And what I found is that like Parenthood is just like life. It happens in phase. It's like I've never been the father of a 20 year olds. This is a whole new part of the ride so I can you know what? I mean? It's like my daughters like ya next year for my birthday. We gonna have a drink and I'm like, wow, okay, she's gonna be turning 21 wide, right? And so I kind of and I'm and I'm I tell my kids that like, sometimes they come to me with certain things. I'm like, I don't know. I'm trying to figure this out like you are you know, but I think that's the challenge is to one of the other challenges is to sort. of unlearn generational You know patterns that you know that we just do is families or as black families or you know, so like for my kids never beat my kids, you know, I don't want them to get whip now for me. I needed to get whoops. Oh, I'm not mad at my mom's right I get it. But you know as a parent I was just I specially because my first to wil girls I never wanted him to have a memory of a man putting a hand on them and that starts with me now to challenge it at is but it becomes psychological warfare because when they messing up, you know there You need to have some lines of authority. So they learn you know, the rules in life, but then it's like okay, how do you because you certain instinctual feelings you have you know, so it's challenging its challenges constantly challenging that it you know, with the oldest. Like I said, it's like it's a whole new ballgame of Connection and all right, how do you because I can't just snatch you up and throw you in the back. You know, you got your own apartment your own car. So this is all right. How do we wait this out that yeah, but I'm still your father.	-1.0

Now know this bird wasn't on the road or anything like it wasn't just like walking on the road and I'm just going to fast and I hit it now. I was going 5 miles over the speed limit 45 is a 40 miles per hour road. You know, how most birds are flying they go over your like windshield or over your car, you know, that's because that's normally miss the car. They don't want to die. Well this bird what's coming perfectly is going to is going to go over pretty did something and they like dip 90 degrees and what under my car now at first I didn't know if it like went under and missed the car or hit my pipe because I didn't feel I didn't feel a bump.

They pay for me to do incredible things that people don't get to do I swim with great white sharks without a cage where she does that although it is kind of like every year makes me wonder how Discovery Channel's going to try and kill me this year and last year. I did a survival show with a British Special Forces Guy where we parachuted from 15,000 feet directly into the Pacific Ocean for 44 hours with no food. No water surrounded by sharks was the fairgrounds or else? No, not the Bear Grylls last night. It was a guy called James glancing who was a royal Marine 44 hours at the ocean. Yeah. That was it's a long time. These aren't you can understand how hard it is when you're bouncing around the ocean. You're tired. You're hungry you're thirsty and trying to cut. Hole in the butt of your wet suit while you're moving around too. So you can poop student suit. You can't sleep in the suit get a rash. Yeah, I thought that was the second one the E before they blew up our boat off the coast of the Bahamas and we drifted through the ocean again through the Atlantic surrounded by Oceanic whitetip sharks, which are the sharks blame for the biggest shark attack in history the at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. So there was Reportedly 300 American Sailors were eat by these sharks. So it was kind of you know, I wasn't just a survival thing was a message about shark conservation and what to do if you're stranded and you lose your boat, but also telling the story of these Sailors, so it was a really great thing to be a part of was there any part of you?	1.0

I think oh gosh. we'll jump was in there somewhere and then I can't remember what the can't remember the Oldham it is and I'm like, you know, I think that could be the only way that like a straight-up pilot could make its way into it is that if the clinic call in the Titan and then that kind of defeats the purpose of it, but to have a character who could like double jump or whatever that yeah, that could kind of be like a grappling hook or a jump pad in a sense that you know, hey, I'm just going to double jump and as long as that was like his passive and it wasn't like Then you had to like recharge on I don't know that could be kind of cool. I mean, I feel like they're definitely need I feel like they're definitely needs to be like maybe a stamina bar on it so that you could have just double don't double jump double double double double double.	0.0

Now we were talking about last episode that we were kind of disappointed because it hasn't really been any music coming out but last week we did get a healthy dose of music. So let's go ahead and go over the new releases 2 Chainz brought out his new project called rapper go to the league, which you had LeBron being a are for which I found that very strange, you know, it's a lot of controversy behind that because they were saying that he did not go to some games or he I'll just just to work on the album, but that's neither here nor there. It was very interesting to change took him onto to be in a are so and he said like this wasn't only project he had them like work on another project to so we'll see what comes through with that but it was a decent album. I listened to it on Friday when it dropped T-Pain Shawty pain because I don't know you probably don't watch it. But I know my girl religiously watch The Masked Singer where they had a whole bunch of whole bunch of Artists and athletes and everything you can name of entertainers dress up in Crazy suits and singing and then, you know, they get voted off of what night and T-Pain want it all and she got me into watching it and I was like, yeah, I was like I can tell his accent. I know that that's t-paint right there and the judge just weren't getting it but he ended up winning everything and if the funny thing ironically though, I would say coincidentally, I won't say ironically coincidentally his New project called wind up drop like the same week that he would so now everybody everybody is thinking that it was just a roll out. This is just to get people to listen to his music. But what did he case his new project called one up that came out like in the middle of the week didn't come out Friday, but go and listen to that Solange. She has been bringing like a lot of visuals and everything and people were like what's going on like she was even like posting a Pedro BlackPlanet people like this Black Planet back. So like right? Yeah, so it was kind of weird it everybody would kind of like speculating what was going on but turns out she has a new project. So she was just doing a lot of promotion for that. So her new project is called when I get home you can go and listen to that little Skies dropped Shelby. I think that this is his second official Studio project from not mistaken. I don't know if we have any little Skies fans that the listen to us, but I believe this is the second official Studio project. So going to listen that if you're a little Skies fan and finally the baby I just get so confused because there's there there's now a saturation of babies out there. We got a little baby then we got double baby. So it's very confusing at times. I like who the hell is is but he's a North Carolina native their child in North Carolina and he dropped his new project called Baby on baby. So very interesting title for a project but those are the notable new releases for the week of March 1st currently its March forth as we're recording. Adding this but these are all the release that came out the week of March 1st. So let's get into the music news. First knew that we have here is Tyrese. Mr. Tyrese is slated to play Teddy Pendergrass and the biopic Now by all pigs have become like very very popular. I think that more and more people were seeing like that. People are very very interested to see some of these stories from the people. You may not know much about you like the inside scoop go through everything that Of that they have been to in their lives and I don't care how many people clown Tyrese I think that he's a good singer. I think that he's a good actor as well. I know he did get called The Fast and Furious stuff, but I mean that's where he made all the bread as I ain't mad and forgetting all their bread and stink it up stick it with the series as long as he did, but Tyrese obviously has been in other movies as well. Like baby voice is probably where everybody remembers him from but he said that Teddy Pendergrass actually asked him to tell his story before you passed away. Not a one thing that I've always. Always had a problem with that. I had an issue with it when it comes to biopics it when you don't actually ask anybody who was around the person or you don't ask the person himself. If you're just going to like make us up as she go that's not a good biopic in my case. But in this particular case with Teddy Pendergrass, he actually is going to have Joan Pendergrass which is Teddy Pendergrass his widow Teddy Pendergrass. By the way. He passed away in 2010. And he's going to have little Marvin is going to come on and write the screenplay and this is all supposed to be Do this by Lee Daniels which pretty much as his hands and everything, so I'm not surprised that Lee Daniels it's going to do this but this biopic but I thought this was interesting though. We have no date as to when it's going to come out. But this is this is all the news that we have so far. So, how do you feel about Tyrese playing Teddy Pendergrass antibiotic?	-1.0
Oh my gosh, catch me off guard. I got glasses and then I got a switch to the other thing. Okay fan of the Week. Hold on did you do that first? Because that's right here my code of the week this week.

I watched it the second time it was right after the opening when they all came in after the elimination and they were sitting around talking Valentina says well that doesn't fit my fantasy and Monique says she could stay home and have the fantasy ha ha ha I literally was like, okay, that's funny Jack.	1.0

What happened was he kind of started moving out started covering too much ground getting a little bit long and away and then and then we moved him to the bronc ride, you know, heck he never even ever got bucked in the bronc riding until he was probably, you know, seven years old, you know, so we're so eight years old. Maybe I can't I'd have to you know look back but but yeah, no he went to the finals again in the bronc riding. Yeah, actually, yeah, he's been as though you know, he been in the finals. I think he went man.	-1.0

You feel like a race like that with you know, something is pretty catastrophically wrong and where you battle through you feel like those races are worth forgetting or really holding costs and remembering because the embattled battled through everyone can relate to to go through something similar to that.

And I'm sorry. I that's underwriting thing that I can't stand is when characters say like sister or brother to their just call them. No one realizes his sister brother. You're not going to you're like you're not you wouldn't enter a room and go.	-1.0
Um, I mean, I was friendly with them. I wasn't like part of like the group though. Like they were big-name fans and I was a big name fan but I was like off sort of on my own. They think like I contributed to like the different events that they did but I wasn't like in like the planning or in that group at all.	1.0
All right, I think one of the biggest things that you so much stuff that I took from that was the fact that it's not all about just like certain people certain lifestyle. Yeah, definitely because I know some of our like summer guys were like, why are we where are we learning a essentially help with drug addict?	1.0
Thanks Jay. Couple of years off my life, but the craziest part to me was that there were some fans some Indians fans who were saying still probably not enough. I'm like, what are you expecting? I do think we need a little bit of a reality check when it comes to what fair trade offers would be. I think like I mean, I think the Dodgers are struggling to come to terms with the idea of even including Gavin Luxe by himself. Like that's it. Yet you're having people saying like Lux plus May plus Verdugo. I would definitely need all three of them and then it probably want like another piece or and it's like that's not how this works and teams treasure young controllable cheap Talent more than ever. And guess what the Dodgers have a really really smart front office. So yes, Dave you think you're sick of the Indians winning 90 plus games every year and not doing anything about it. Dodgers fans are so sick of the Dodgers winning. Seven straight NOS titles and having nothing to show for it with a massive payroll and robust farm system, but still their teams are disciplined and the Dodgers have a really good front office and they're not just going to throw everything at the wall to get Lindor for two years and maybe they could reassign them. But, you know teams just don't do that. I think it used to be a lot easier to pull off this sort of trade because there are there were more dumb front offices. I don't think I think there's only a couple of now and those teams probably are pretty bad. So you're not going to be dealing with them in this situation.	-1.0
You try to get an internship. Yeah, at first I tried to get an internship there, right? So I don't know why because maybe you my goal here is to train more in the open gyms. So, of course, if you're in turn you're going to get the key and you could use the gym, but it was not so you are not focus on coaching yet. No, not yet. Not yet. So I tried it a couple of times. But due to my my schedule at work, I have two shifts. So I cannot cover all the ships that they are asking for me.	-1.0

Well, so yeah. No, I mean I'm not going to sit here and say they're the best ever but they were awful good like well one cult in particular I actually sold in the security and I think it was like 2012. Well, it's see I would have been 2012. I sold a horse. Pony man, he belongs to stay Smith now and he was he was out of that cult crop, you know, and then there was you know, he was by far the shiniest one. I mean, I guess I sold him to stay. I'm pretty sure it was 2012. He bought him there at the Benny Binion sailed, you know the bucking horse or a bucking horse security actually stays puts it on and and yeah, so Smith, I'd buck that colt there and Smith. Bought him and I think he's been to the NFR every year since like, oh, well, yeah, he's he was the shiniest one by far and then oh, I have a few other ones that are just really nice horses, you know that route. And so I think that first whole crop, but probably had well I'm going to say I can't I don't recall but I'm gonna say between 15 and 20 Colts to start with and I'm about I have when do you start those horses? I'm sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Wendy's start those horses, you know, how long is it before you start to know if you made the right breeding decision? Oh, well, sometimes a level five years, but for that particular to answer your question directly, the first part of the question was, you know, when do we start a I start dummy are blocking the Colts when they're too and and and I just dummy buckham once when they're to unless they just flat run off if they just flat run off. Then on my block him again, you know and do something a little bit different just but I bought them wants when they're two or twice. Like I said and then same when there's three and then so then when therefore I get people on them, you know, they start with their Riders. So a lot of them a lot of them horses have anywhere from two three, maybe four trips by the time they're four year olds, and then then it's time for a rider and and sometimes you know, they They you know, if you can see that they're pretty sure of their feet and their they have a really controlled style and they're you know, they're when I say a controlled style, you know, like the akkad. I got a pattern and they're like I said their feet are running room and all that's going on good and I feel confident. I'll stay up and not fall down with the guy. So I'll go ahead and put a guy on him with a couple of dummy trips and then and then the other ones, you know, there's those horses that I've Listen, I hate to admit it but there's horses. I've raised it. It took six or eight trips to before I felt confident to put a guy on it because it was all down all of ya and and generally that's the wild or wasn't it and going back to the breeding. That's when they're bred wrong. They're too wild and you know bucking horses. Sometimes the the Layman fan gives bucking horses a bad rap like they're there and I shouldn't that sounds wrong. I got I wish I could I was better with my words, but They get kind of a bad rap like her wild and yeah, you guys know that's that's not the case at all. Some of these some of these horses are really gentle and really good to be around and and and generally speaking is the more quiet they learn calm. They learned Focus. They are the better bucking horses. They are they you know, they don't have to be Wild Buck. We all know that what a maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not a bucking horse guy got on some back in the day and never never did any good at it? Didn't ever understand it but aside from just sighs. How do you how do you choose which which event you want to Buck those horses a cracker or saddle bro? Yes. That's a really good question for me. First of all, you're going to see when you dummy block them kind of what they do with their head. And when I was talking a minute ago about the control their body control while there while they're bucking with just a dummy on that gives you a little bit of an indication of what event to do to put them in. in butt butt For me, I found more of their mother. So if their mother could take the bronc riding and tolerated it and she liked it and bucks in it. The Colts in seems to do that, you know, tools will follow suit now that's not always the case but a lot of the time it is, you know, an in an unfortunately the way as the way the rodeo business is now with the shorts. Age of bareback Riders, sometimes you are forced to put Colts in the bronc riding that you're not 100% sure if it's going to work or not when you're first blocking them around but sometimes there's it works out beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't but for the most part you kind of got a number one go with their style number two kind of their mom and then third the availability of the riders that are there that day you have very many of those horses that you may be starting. In one event and then decide that they need to go to the other event, or maybe they do both events or oh absolutely. So so I have a horse named Capone and he's been in a far five times. I think or maybe six and his mom is out of one of our famous men as Raggedy Ann. Well when I first started bucking Capone, he was a bare back and he went to the finals like for three or four times and bareback, you know in the bareback riding.	1.0

Okay, you have been watching the Mandalorian and how does it feel to be me?	1.0
I didn't know what to expect. I think you know because originally like when my mom was telling me I was hesitant, you know, I was you know, I don't need to meet him and you know, she was just like no just meet your father and I should you know, and and when I think about it now and my mother and I have never Discussed this but when I think about it now, you know, some of that was probably for her as well like yo, I had this kid together married for a couple of years like you ain't been in his life and which would make sense to me. I get it like at least see him once you know, but for me, I really didn't have any expectation, you know, and It you know, it's a it's a weird thing, you know, but for me, I took all of those emotions and I turned them into fuel a really transformed all of those. I guess you could call them negative feelings and I transformed it into fuel, you know, and and and I also use that you know, I felt like I'm the man of the house. I gotta protect you. I gotta protect my mother. I'm gonna make sure she good, you know, and I took it and ran.	1.0

It's my group coaching program that will start the week before New Year's and continue throughout January and it's an alternative for people who want to escape the pervasive diet culture messaging and leave the New Year's wait resolutions behind and instead focus on your true health and becoming a more intuitive eater. So you'll receive 10 Deep learning videos. From me that I'll send out weekly each focusing on a different principle of intuitive eating how to break down and understand the principles and actually start living them. You'll also receive guided somatic meditations that allow you to understand the principles in an embodied way and not just cognitively you'll also receive reflective questions that allow for deeper introspection that you can translate these principles into your own life.

In this would be phylogenic. Would it not in terms of Casey in terms of am I using that? All right. Yeah. It's an honor can't unlearn but I think a problem is that we need to remember also just talking behaviourally for a second it remember food is Food Water oxygen sex Jinx, of course, we both say that one believe activity. These are all unconditioned reinforcers like you are born from day one known as to teach you these things are valuable to you, right? You are born from day one saying okay. This is like this is something that I like write it maintained your behavior if you cried and you got food. Wow, I'm going to cry more. I'm going to get food again. So this happens but what we've set up is and this has been that we naturally need we've created this idea that food should be are like reinforcer for doing something like oh, yeah, I I started with my pajamas today. I went to the gym today now I get to eat right or like I starved myself six days out of the week. Now. I can go ham and put every single thing that I like could have spread out them across the entire week into one weekend or you know, and I think that like, I think that Maybe Society has also shaped the way that we look at Food whereas it should be something that is like you need. This is a human need is really I marry yeah, these are primary and unconditioned reinforcers. You need it and we're looking at it as that's our reward, right? Like how many people are like, I mean, I remember just yeah, I'm sorry. I mean not I'm sorry. I meant I'm sure you remember and yells also going to be embarrassed. I mentioned this. But your sorority days back before you were this hippie chick like you always were this girl at heart but I'm saying I remember even talking about it with you. Like how many girls would go the entire week not eating anything just so they could get super drunk on like and go. What was it Big Slice?	-1.0
Well, that's it. I want to thank you for spending this time with me today. I appreciate it going down memory lane. And that's great that you've written a book about fatherhood because you know black fatherhood is something that's that's not discussed enough or at least not discussed in the context in which you're discussing it like a lot of times. It's always the conversation is always about what black fathers aren't doing right as opposed to this is how you manage, you know, being a black father and what that means. So you speaking to it from that perspective I think is probably I'm sure Go help somebody hopefully yeah. All right. Well, good luck to you Cowboys. Yes. Okay. Thank you for having me. Yeah, no, no problem anytime. And yeah, I hope for your sake this season doesn't go doesn't derail. Just why I'm for nice family. Wow, that was real convenient that a real comedian.

So need gets it gets really dangerous when the smart teams are also the rich teams like the Yankees who have been so very disciplined over the past several years fans screaming go back to the days of old when you threw money at everybody and that's not the way they had operated for the past several years until this offseason and when the perfect storm for them got laid at their feet they needed in a starter Gerrit Cole is Guy that just doesn't seem like he has any alarming issues tied to him at least at the moment. I know that's knock on wood for any pitcher, but there's a reason why he got the money he did and pretty much everybody agrees that he's probably worth it. And so it became a layout for them to be able to get it done. But in the past they have been operated like the Yankees. We used to see in the before the mm rolled around and they were winning world. Oops year after year after year, it's been a little bit of a different dynamic in that front office. And they the Dodgers are sort of a similar team we talked about this when we initially started talking Lindor rumors at the beginning of the offseason and I said one of the things that I think will be interesting is how desperate to these teams get where you've been operating this way like the Dodgers have where you have the strong farm system. You already have a really deep talented roster. You probably don't need to do a lot but are the fans starting to get it to you. There are Upset is just winning the division every single year and hoping that you the two random randomness your way into winning a world title. Are they going to be happy with that or are they going to feel some pressure and that was always something in the back of my mind that that thought. I thought maybe that was something that could help push or escalate a trade of Lindor to a situation like LA because if they're just evaluating this based on spreadsheets and surplus-value. Value years of control cheap control at that guy's that allow them to spend more money on other parts of their roster through free agency. If they would like to the one thing was going to change that was that sense of desperation and needing to change the the way they've gone about things in the past several years and we'll see because They didn't come away with that that major free agent peace or trade piece as of yet. So are they going to feel that sense of desperation as this winter unfolds? I don't know but that was the one thing that was kind of a wild card in my line for getting these these sorts of this sort of trade done.	1.0

We're ten minutes away from Brighton Solitude Snowbird and and Ulta, you know, we're not have which I take advantage of know you don't but what's cool as is I would film these guys and they film me and we all because we had a photographer. The crew to and we would we would film each other all the time snowboard and doing all these cool tricks and all this stuff and I would make a DVD at the end of the year and then the next the following year. I edit during the summer and the following year. We have an open house and I would actually Premier the the movie that's so cool van. That's really cool with sell these DVDs out of the back of my car van ten bucks a pop. I walked away one time with $200. I knew at that point you could make money from this. I knew at that point. I was like, you know, you don't have to take that easy route you can An actually do something for yourself and I think that's why I'm always in the freelance mindset. Right and I'd you know, you can make money from this just by doing something yourself.	1.0

Yeah. Okay. So, um, I think that's enough for funny stories. We got pretty into that one.	1.0
Well a lot of People kind of say like, oh you just threw the baby out with the bathwater like you jumped from Christian to atheism and that wasn't the case at all. I actually still believed in God for probably two years after I stop calling myself a Christian and I just had this feeling of like organized religion put God in a box and like it forced us to have these certain stories that were culturally specific and that didn't, you know, go over like to other countries. Or whatever and I just remember having this like since the freedom where it's like I could go to any country and experience like what they consider like profound spirituality and I could apply that to my life without feeling like, you know, it's not accurate and and I just remember thinking like all these religions throughout the entire world have claimed to have spiritual experiences. They've To have these miracles happen and I just I didn't like thinking like they were wrong and I'm right and like my specific story is like the one true truth and like shedding to that story itself allowed me to view like God in a much more like open way that I found super inclusive and inviting and more cohesive. And you know, I still actually hold a lot of those values. Like I want I think I'm still slightly bitter when it comes to organized religion, but I definitely want to get to the point where I can go, you know to other countries and experience, you know, their religion and their culture and everything that comes with that and just, you know, apply that to my life and you know become a better person based off of these were	-1.0
I don't know let's not get there.	1.0
So I was a week ahead of him and then he followed then so my goal there as well.	1.0

Mr. Honey. What's going to happen with Reggie news Ted that certainly tantalizing hook, you know, Alice and the farm and Charles and Betty, but it ends up being at least the flash for we get at the end of the episode is to spring break and we see everybody's searching for Jughead after he says I'm going to Stonewall it's gonna be great.	1.0
No, okay. Not generally I mean track athletes besides like swimmers are some of the you know, best athletes just physically football guys managed.	1.0
No, I wouldn't say it was any pressure because again, you you have to work with the opportunities that come your way I think for me a little further down where in my career and not to fast forward that far but I think that's why house was such a significant move because at that point I was like yo, I got to do something to break out of this mold or if you want to call it that I just knew I had to do something that they do not see coming and nobody saw that coming you CER that way not really, okay only because I was only 14 So and I knew it wasn't you know, it was gonna have that lasting thing. It was a cool little pop up. But I mean it was a cool little pop. It was a biggest show on television, but because I wasn't like entrenched in fashion. It it really didn't hit me that way, you know, but that for me that I was making that move to do house was a great move.	1.0
So that was really difficult well, and it's wonderful to have that support because not everyone does get that type of support say go do the tour.	1.0

I don't remember the last time I sent one to somebody other than you. So like I'm not sure but it's so funny though because I like love like an unsolicited dick pic. I think I'm in the minority of this category of women. That's like surprised me with a knife. little present like like I'm at work or I'm getting ready to go well and you're getting ready to go out. You're about to get in the shower. Send me a dick pic. I'll be like, yes. Thank you so much. I'll like maybe I'll someone back probably not probably felt like I don't know why I just love that like little surprised. Do you save them? If they send it through text, yeah, I don't delete any of my texts. Like what do you like save the photo to your photos or like you just leave it in the thread. I have saved them to my photos because like what of might accidentally get deleted but why do you need to save them because what if I want to look at it later, what if I put that like compare and contrast? Like I said if I could curate a whole Art Exhibit I said a museum earlier, but now it's an Art Exhibit that dick pic. I just feel like that's my what my life work should be.	1.0
Yeah kinda sorta we had picked up because they think like we we laugh about this now but like, you know as they start blowing up and that part when I say, we, you know, we stopped dating and whatever, you know, I've started this is when cell phones is just coming around like it's normal for people who haven't Phone call the number change. So I call them all script like yo her number change. Yeah, she ain't give you the new number his number. I'll call yo. Why don't you be the new number? Oh, I forgot Bubba Bubba that happened like one other time and I was like yo the next time your number change and you don't give me the new number. I ain't calling you no more and the number chanting I and I didn't call her no more and that's how we grow apart. But you know, what's the funny part? One of the funny parts of this story is her homegirl that I just mentioned two weeks before that they would I think they was in Atlanta and she said they would just you know, the girls night Sex in the City whatever and they just got into a random conversation with a homegirl a sir. Who's the one you know, who's the guy that you know you would you feel like got away or that you would marry the drop of a dime and she said me. Is it was okay that it out? So then two weeks later. I'm in a club in a home girls like oh, you know quiche and she called me I was that was the girl is crazy.	1.0
Well, I will tell them the story of me joining a second gym because because of that so I go to boot camp gym now. Love it, but for me, I am a burn time a bar lover and I kind of a behind my husband's back this week. And I joined about a local bar studio that Alpha also offers yoga and So currently I can't go see my therapist because she's got some stuff going on and we probably will be back for a month or two. So I'm in my mind. I was like, well, I'm going to try a new form of kind of self helping myself and I'm gonna do Yoga three times a week to see if I can kind of like Get Out of My Head learn how to like take deep breaths and really focus on the important things and just kind of have that me time. That's not not like going to the like another gem. This is like truly like a mind-body connection type of a thing. So report back on it. I'm going to go to my first yoga class next week I'm signed up to do it. So but it's like I think it's those things. It's like what can you do like, you also have to think outside yourself like, okay. Well, I've tried this. This doesn't work. Can I do something else do I think that will help and I so I'm going to try this for a few months and see if we'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I mean it's not going to hurt anything. So if anything it makes me feel stretchy, so right.	1.0

So just like Italy underwater I don't I don't ever want to just order the water. No, I think that as soon as you bring in that number or that like external measurement of a food it inhibits your ability to actually check in with yourself and ask yourself what you feel like eating SO trading the rules about what you should be eating what you think would be a good choice and actually just start to feel into what you're craving what you feel like eating and instead of thinking about you know, how healthy this. All is or what? The calorie content is ask yourself. How do I want to feel after eating this or what value do I want to honor right now with this food decision. So really just starting to bring it to a more internal place that you're deciding for yourself what you want to eat instead of allowing some externalized message or voice tell you what you should order the next thing I would recommend for somebody who wants to start intuitive eating which is something you can do today. Is to start to get curious about the way that your body communicates with you in a unique which is unique to you. So how do you know you're hungry and what are the ways in which your body lets you know that you're hungry. How do you know when you're full and what are the cues that your body sends you to let you know that you've had enough to eat start to build awareness of these different cues so that you can build that sense of trust in your own body and you don't need to just look up what is a proper portion size for this. Food, but rather how much of this food do I actually need until I'm satisfied. And also just to start responding to your hunk like the bait the most basic intuitive eating recommendation I can make is just to honor your hunger which is another of the principles of intuitive eating. So when you feel hungry instead of like questioning yourself or asking yourself if it's okay to eat or if you can justify it in some way like what if you just gave yourself permission to eat and then you just moved on with your day and what would that change for you?	0.0

Then the game will be fixed. So everyone can use a case. That's not what valve want and they are trying to see if there's a world where you can use both guns situationally it It'll be it'll be a bit better to have a creek but not too much that it ruins the game. Maybe the I think putting the price back up was like in general what most people thought would be a good idea. So yeah. Yeah, so I think I think it's a good idea, but that's sick and then didn't cash.	-1.0

For example, these may be small family offices that are throwing up maybe a couple of products every few years and they're not what we would Define as cereal buyers a construction services. And so when they go to develop a apartment Complex, they say right? What's the lowest cost that I can get this at the make the pro forma work not what would be the lowest cost at scale? If I was to build a thousand of these things some of your more your larger owners more Progressive owners think of a hotel flag like a Marriot. They are fully bought into the concept of modularization because I know they're going to be building hotels from now until the foreseeable future and the more cost-effective way. They can do that. They're interested in that and a big way. So at bathroom pain that's built in Miami or bathroom fathers built in Seattle. They're all for standardization Montreux zation and making their buildings more efficient from a construction standpoint because the scale and the dollars that have Place think of the same thing for somebody like a Facebook or Google that's going to be investing in billions of dollars worth of data centers over the next decade. Those are the folks that are really lean in same. All right, if we're able to save one percent on Ten billion dollars worth of construction that's real dollars that that that's a conversation. We're worth having if it's a fifteen million dollar apartment complex that only means, you know 1% of that to one owner. It doesn't get a whole lot of attention and when you see the magnitude of dollars that are spent on a sort of capex and the industrial face those are big dollars and the opportunity time the down time relative to construction or maintenance in those plants has big dollar. As well, so it's really the magnitude of the opportunity that gets people's attention. Otherwise, it's just something neat to talk about, you know, can we build something offsider prefab and slide and employees great. But what does that mean for either the economics of the project itself or the overall business?	1.0
Definitely not PG-13 Up. It was on my phone and she's looking over my shoulder and I was like just kind of closed. My phone really quick was like, I don't know where they are. I'll find them. So yeah, I am so uncomfortable like violently uncomplicated violently uncomfortable.	-1.0

Okay, it's the second one. So I was on a date and fell so hard that I was gushing and tore my knee open. We went back to his apartment and cleaned it up and ended up having bomb-ass sex when Queen yes Queen when we turn the light on there was blood everywhere from my embarrassing, right it gets better. I ended up not talking to him much, but I matched with the guy. On tin with his weight sorry much but I matched with this guy on Tinder and turns out it was his roommate and he heard all the sex we had LMAO I oh I have more element feyo. This is a short story.

You can watch it. It's on YouTube.	1.0
I think. Every time I feel like just crazy crazy anxious, especially at night. It seems like it gets really bad at night. I'll watch an episode of like schitt's Creek or the office or something. That's like just I kind of know what's gonna happen. The characters are comforting to me and afterward it kind of like get your mind off of it and then afterwards it's like, all right, maybe this wasn't so crazy after all I also have the Calm app the daily corium. When I pay you for like the yearly thing or whatever and they have like a daily calm every day that's like 10 minutes and you do this calming thing and they have a bunch of different other like series on there too, like tackling anxiety and means meaningful eating mindful eating and just different things like that that it's so funny because you said like listening to Christian music and it feels very like woo or like just kind of corny or Shay. Yeah, well, you're just like okay, I do a meditation but that stuff really does help and it really makes a difference and I don't think there's anything wrong with doing it. I mean it but yeah, I've totally at first I was like this is so stupid. This is not going to help me but just like anything else if the more you do it the more it's gonna help you.	1.0
I see that okay this year, especially because like my baby girl, she's just like a different type of personality and we Have an interest in connection because it's like she's I just um, she just like me in a sense of out sometimes my wife gets frustrated and I'm like I go over I say three things and she's like, oh, okay and it works and she says I'm just like, I don't know we got this thing, you know that it works. But with yeah, my son is definitely because he's a mama's boy. And so it's a he's a great kid, but it really is challenging because you want as a man as I look at it. It's like, you know when you discipline your kids like the Appling you're going to receive outside of these walls of our house has no love attached to it. It's just cold. It's just you know what? I mean? So the discipline you receive with us. It's coming from a loving place. There's a lesson to be taught here as a lesson for you to learn and I think like as a man you like, you know, you want your son to be tough. You want to this she wanted to be that but I think you have to meet each child where they're at. They're all three different personalities, you know, and and that's another part of the challenge. Because you just want to sort of lay down this one law that doesn't work for you, you know, and that's you know, when you when you juggle in three different personalities or have them in multiple kids that definitely can be challenging.	-1.0

Everything is knowing that you know in any small way or any big way. I could have a positive influence on someone's life. You know, I feel like a lot of us haven't sometimes our judgment is cloudy. Sometimes we don't know why things are the way they are and so I just try to help increase my clients awareness and understanding the true problem and then going to the root and seeing how we can transform them internally and then eventually as we do that the external transformational just follow, you know, so it's more just about what are you doing day? Like, why do you why do people want to lose 10 pounds? Why do what people want to lose 30 pounds? But really it's Yes, it's a health decision. But it's also an emotional decision. Yeah, like good exactly. Right. It's a you know, what sometimes the opinions of others have like a huge role but I think the most important thing is your own opinion, you know, everybody's different. So what makes you happy is it losing 20 pounds? Is it getting a little bit stronger? Is it, you know increasing your self defense is it just being more functional, you know, everything's different majority of your clients.	1.0

The voice of the skull crawler is very high in tone. It's possessing a raspy quality of the hiss and growl mixed in between according to supervisor sound a sound designer and editor Al Nelson. The skull crawlers voice was inspired by the painful bye-bye the painful squeal of a Dying rabbit. And also the and sounds of sea lions and squirrels are mixed together. And this is what is the sound that they commonly make? And one of its vocalizations work we cycled from the indominus Rex from Jurassic World. And unless it's called crawlers appear to be naturally Fearless as two of them teamed up to attack Kong despite being smaller and outmuscled. The largest of the skull crawlers which by some has been given the nickname scold devil appear to be more intelligent than the rest of his kind and this was seen it when he appeared only ones called was subdued by Preston Packard and we'll what it felt like and what it felt like Earl Cole was tricking it. It also has to has to also seems to have a hint of sad ISM or sadism as as it licked columns face maliciously after he'd been Tangled Up and of shipwrecks Rudder chain, this large skull crawler was also shown to have deep desire. Killing and eating humans and that was shown several times when he diverted his attention from Kong to Jan's comrade at Mason Weaver implying that he opted that that he acts not only from Primal Instinct, but from over some degree of malice and cruelty.	0.0

I had no idea what I wanted to do. So I went to a Julia business school, which that's what most women did in my day. I got my associates degree and I became a legal secretary. Yeah, you know it all worked out fine, but when I look back on it now. Yeah, I wish my parents had pushed me to go to a four-year College. I wished I had become a vet or something along those lines something to do with the animals. But to be honest, it's hard to know what you want to do when you enter college at the age of 18. Yeah, you have any regrets? I do and I regret is that I wished I had gone to a four-year College. I wished I had moved away from my parents home and get that. I think my life would have been totally different. Maybe I would have become a bit. Maybe who knows? Yeah. Sure.	1.0

Okay, so and where did you start? So we're talking about it in one of the small groups and he asked me.	0.0
Yeah, I think I got just under 12 hours. I think it was 11 hours 38 minutes. So I got my got a big mug, which was not a subject to be honest wasn't sure if I'd be able to achieve that but I did which was great because I did serve Coast last year and I'm I've got my little mug then I had a horrendous time. It says closed last year. I didn't realize it at the time but I actually had infected corneas and I ended up spending more in hospital. I had to go to him. DCI. Yes. It was the most the most painful thing. I've experienced besides childbirth. Yeah, so to go back and get under 12 hours was pretty cool. Yeah, it's amazing. How did he get infected corny is no idea. I don't know how I got infected couriers. I knew something was wrong. I thought it was. It was conjunctivitis, but then it became apparent that it was worse than that and I really didn't start but then I thought well if I could just make it to checkpoint to its DNS is better than a DNS and then at the checkpoint to my there's a few drawings. It was a long day. That is a huge blur in my mind. I don't remember it very well because I could barely see but one thing and I was it a lot of paid and apparently the weather was terrible, but that just didn't register with me at all because I had other things on my mind, you know, wow finished. Yeah, right seen hours.	-1.0

I definitely want to let you know that just because this is, you know, a quote-unquote vegan podcast. It doesn't mean that I'm going to sit here and tell you all the benefits of being vegan and all the reasons why you should do it too and all the reasons why you should raise your kids vegan. I am not about That I'm not about telling anybody what to do. I think that my podcast is going to be here more to educate you on my life not necessarily to have you sway one way or the other that's that's your choice a hundred percent your choice and your kids are going to be raised the way that you wanted raise them. You know, I'm definitely not here to tell you to do it one way or the other or my way is Better no. No. No, you know you guys make your decisions and just listen to to the podcast and make your decisions off of your own research. Definitely don't don't feel the need to to do something or live the lifestyle just because you're listening to the podcast. There's a zero judgment zero judgment Zone moving on to the other kind of mom that I am I am. I am in the process of becoming a surrogate mom that is exciting news. That's kind of a little mini bomb that I wanted to drop on you guys. So I want to shine some light into that area of my life. We are in the beginning stages. I wouldn't say the early stages. That was a long time ago. That was like back in November. That's early stages. So I've been in this process for quite some time quite a few months. So it is I'm not I am now ready. It is time for me to reveal this news to you and part of the reason why I wanted to do that and why I wanted to include my surrogacy process in this podcast is because of the feedback that I've gotten by family members and non family members. So I I wanted to shine some light into that part of my life to help people make the correct decisions and to help people understand what it's like to be on my side. I know that people see a lot of advertisement about making x amount of money to help and what not and I basically want to give you my side of the story and why I'm doing it. So one of the next episodes will be about That specifically just surrogacy so stay tuned stay tuned for more on that process and the fourth type of mother that I am I like to say that I'm a mother F. ER so side note. I don't cuss that much when I do it's very rare, but I won't say I don't do it. I do do it sometimes but if I can avoid it I will So I am a mom of multiples. I'm a bonus Mom. I'm becoming a surrogate mom and I'm a mother F ER. So I am the mother of all mothers or at least I'm calling myself one.	1.0
In their natural everyday life totally like how off you know, it's so normalized like how often do you hear people say I need to burn this off or I need to like work out so that I can go to brunch even here in like Fitness classes. A lot of Fitness instructors will use terms like, you know burn it to earn it and it's just like do you say something L. I actually do because I obviously am very strongly opinionated about this and it's really harmful because not everybody is there to like learn Our food and why can't we just enjoy moving our bodies without feeling like we need to compensate for food? It's like I don't ever have to think about needing to compensate so that I can take a breath or like use oxygen which is another just physiological need but why is there all of this language around food as if it's something we need to earn when it's like your body just requires food and you don't need to earn or compensate for your food and anyway, and that mentality is what's so damaging not even really the the food itself. I'm I love this.	-1.0
All the oceans go out from from an academic point of view. I would say it's a continuation in modern economics of the realist philosophy philosophical tradition. All right. So in philosophy of this old debate this all disagreement about the question with that any universals and then this is a real dispute that goes back to the Greeks and then in the Middle Ages, so the The idea that the question was whether there are causal connections or concept more generally speaking that apply at all times and places. Okay, and on this ground, so do people believe that this is true. They are called the real risks and the people who believe that there is no such thing that all stood all times in all places, but all things have we can know only related to particular historical conditions of time and place and We'll have to be identified in and again new and all general concepts that we could ever use are just some sort of Temporaries summaries of what we currently know and currently think well, these people are called the nominal this and the positivist and in the 20th century, the the nominalist have hijacked economics, not only economics but you can always in particular and the only guys left standing on. On the realest cam. Well, there might be a few others, but the most important group left standing is the the austrians. So the austrians think that there is such a thing as economic loss. I saw the call who connections that whole to at all times and all places. If you increase the money supply. Well, then the price it will tend to increase at all times and all places. It's not just to today in France or in the UK, but all in all countries and all at all times. So that's the option position. That's really what makes them. Particular and the others so they don't believe this kind of thing and there's a second thing that also came that has complicated things on top of this namely the idea that they are constant quantitative relationships now, that's that's not at all the same thing, but that's what the the most other economists are looking for right there. So they think that in the social field in the economy there is that Loss of any kind in this should be of the quantitative thought such as the law of gravity and so on that we know from from physics, so there should be a Content constant quantitative relationship between different variables that we have trusted in and again, like one example might be the money's stock quantity of money on the one hand and the price I love you on the other all the austrians don't believe that there is such a constant quantitative. Because the money supply is just one among other factors that influences the price level and it does influence the price level only through the subjective values of all people all Market participants. So Market participants that they are videos that doubt with the faculty to choose and they might change their opinions and I changed the values might change from one moment to the other and of course, they're different one from one individual to another so that makes it there can be no such thing as a constant quantitative relationship. The only thing that is constant is indeed that there is a relationship between the money supply and the price level they're positively related but there is no exact quantitative relationship. I'm afraid that was quite a little bit but you ask me I know it's absolutely right.	-1.0
What have you done so far so laughter and some initial tests last week, which was good.	1.0
Okay, so a needle filter but it is that means that means that I make jewelry and other items from wool roving wool roving is wrong. Whoa. It's right from the Sheep. It's been cleaned car. Added which makes it straight and then dyed into you know, a thousand different shades of colors. I was introduced to needle felting in 2003 by my very close friends foo yung it Potter in the Adirondacks. She had on a beautiful Needle felted necklace that she made is to make me one. She pretty much said no, you can make it yourself. She pulled out some roving showed me how to make a bead and the rest is history. I fell in love with it. I started my own little business. It's called ourselves creation. Yeah, I love doing it. I have expanded my knowledge over the years by taking some classes and other forms of felting needle felting wet felting hat making stuff like that. I do a lot of shows during the year. I have my own website. What does that learning to build screams now, you gotta spell it out.	1.0

But yeah. Was great. It was doc said probably the best I've seen apply especially especially under Noona if we just take our chances are many times. I need to keep saying and that game would have been out of sight and in the second half we wouldn't have happened. Well, it obviously would have happened but you know, we put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that second half a lot of unneeded pressure. Is that deeper and deeper which have been conscious of in the past few seasons. Anyway, I Watford New Year if I could Braga. Yeah, so it yeah, the first off was great should have put the going to bed, but it's one of those Delivered when it was terrible probably the worst team us. I've seen this either.

It's like crew of people who like we said, we like talk about our emotions all the time. We like text about like, you know, just like to give each other affirmations and all that stuff and with them it's really different, but I wanted to talk a little bit about how to really ask how someone's doing because we're so unused to it and I certainly was really, you know, I was like a foal trying to walk. It was just all like you know, like shifting weight awkwardly like buckling under certain pressures and all this stuff and When you ask how someone's doing and they're like, oh, you know the same, you know, same same tired like everyone else and they move you along.	-1.0
And you know what like in the scale Fox right so much to you could wake up in the morning having not eaten anything and weigh a certain way and then add in the afternoon you go weigh yourself and you are to 7 pounds heavier or you you know, haven't Peter poop jet. So your this much like the number on the scale. I mean again, it's focusing on what makes you healthy right?	1.0
What is this thing about liveness that you just can't look away. It's crazy.	-1.0
It kind of seems like a good idea. You know what I mean to some degree. This is back then so just before rebooting everything, right?	1.0
What do you think? It's going to take to be Stratford?	1.0
So I know it's it. I don't want to keep making the references but it is very much tilted as Far as like people think that oh, I'm gonna get the best loot here, but it's like no dude just go a little bit Southwest you got something way better Thunderdome is quite literally if you look at the map that we're looking at Thunderdome is literally surrounded by mid-tier things. So if you go to Thunderdome first, you have three different places to choose from that you can still get mid-tier stuff from yeah exactly.	1.0
Oh, absolutely, you know performance and you know, what's the three p's Prodigy performance and pedigree? And so that that's you know, that's that's the three the three Deals in the whatever it is the beef business everybody looks at those and I look at it kind of the same way in the in the bucket Bowl deal. You know, you gotta gotta have those ingredients. Obviously. We you can't have Prodigy if you've never read them, but You know, that's the third leg of that if if that you know, somebody does cross that bridge will then and breeds one of them both. Well, that's great.	1.0
I mean, maybe maybe they did see that sliver where he is. Just very loyal to Betty. You know, I was they've been best friends for a long time.	1.0
Well, I would probably get the government out of it. You kitchen I was just completely out of it all education.	-1.0
Yeah, I'll go first. So I think anyone who probably knows me since I was a kid knows that Audrey was that anxiety girl the worrier and I grew up in the church and so a big Big part of my upbringing was you know, pray about it and you know, don't worry don't be anxious and have faith and all of that stuff is fantastic and amazing and it is helpful. But sometimes if you have a sinus infection or you have the flu you go get medicine to help you with that or you go see a doctor and so my anxiety kind of got to a point where it was really hard to even function where it was just like okay something is not right here. And so I would say probably probably in college is kind of when I finally was like, all right, this is not this is not normal like normal people don't get this worried to the point of you know, you can't even do new things or you can't function in life. And so I started first seeing a counselor and she was really really helpful. I think one thing about a counselor is they're awesome. But sometimes we kind of view them as like a Next it's like okay, I'm gonna fix it. But just like a car you don't get your oil changed once and then drive the car for 10 more years sure. So I think with anxiety different things in your life can kind of happen and it rears its ugly head. And so I think it's important to kind of know yourself and know what your triggers are and and acknowledge them and then not wait until things get really really bad before you try to get. Because it's just going to be that much harder to dig kind of dig out of it. Yeah, for sure. Yep.	-1.0
That's probably a normal decision, I guess because there's part of me that says like our the last time we had when somebody died so we shouldn't do that again, but then there's also the part of me too. It's like you got to get back on the horse, right?	1.0
Like, what's got you entry what's got you peaked right now really interested to see, you know, we get asked all the time. When as the recession coming in we were on the largest expansion Area Cycle from a building. Environment standpoint that we've ever been on in kind of recorded history. And so everyone's waiting for the other shoe to drop and for there to be some sort of Market pull back, but barring any sort of mega event. We don't see a giant monolithic downward shift in the construction industry happening like in 2008 where the music just stopped overnight. We do see pockets of the industry from a sector level and a geographic level that will begin softening, you know at different rates. I'm going to different times but I'm most interested to see how contractors react to that change and markets and I think contractors this time around have been more sobered and more cautious and maybe more paranoid than contractors were in a seven and a way where if you flash back to 2007 times were good. There wasn't a lot of people that were scared of a downturn and then boom all of a sudden. We were caught in a new reality. I think you flash forward to today and it's almost the opposite mentality that we see in the marketplace where as people are constantly paranoid about when the market is going to ship that they're thinking about today how to prepare their Organization for living in a different tomorrow is so so we have we have a lot more confidence. I would say from a broad sense that the contractor Market is much more prepared to deal with a recession than they were in. Seven or at least they thought about it and planned about it more now. It's still probably be painful for some but I think the construction in secret could probably use a slight pullback for the amount of stress that's out there right now on labor markets for my stress. It's on contractor balance sheets currently as they're trying to execute all this work slight cooling off period although I don't never with the recession on on any industry or any economy a slight cooling off period could actually be a chance. Or the construction industry in North America to catch its breath.	-1.0
Yeah real life on stream. Is that what you're about to say dude? Sometimes my God Larry dude. Oh my God. No. Yeah. Do you say Kappa Kappa Kappa guys, if I said Kappa or law in real life? I think I'd get fired.	1.0

It was all it was a lot of things rolled into one you had to have a lot of different you had of Hosting skills. You had a design skills comedy was in there as well. So before we move on to our next topic though, I just wanted to say thank you for making AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of TV talk for us to grow. We need your help. So continue to like and comment on both our YouTube channel and on our iTunes channel here on the drag race AfterBuzz TV panel. We give you a cool.

Yo Peninsula, which is down Echoes 1200 case, doesn't it?	0.0
Don't look back and have regrets understand that you're at a place in the position right now. When hard work and valuing people nothing can stop you.	-1.0
I'm just capital expenditure. So Investments that are made by businesses into property plant and equipment. So real assets that are either either viewed as new construction or additions to existing assets capex is big-time and industrial space, you're talking billions of dollars for you know, the large energy providers of the folks that are in oil refinery businesses or Midstream transmission oil and gas in there's a lot of dollars at play there. And so When you when you have a program of construction the stretches billions of dollars you start to look at that holistically as to how can we improve our productivity our efficiency are cost particular when you have repeatable structures and repeatable product type. How can we become more efficient of that over time? And that's really where off-site construction becomes really attractive.	1.0
without a doubt Some cheese on there. Sometimes it's your favorite food fucking chicken alfredo fettuccine. I should slap all the burdens One Roof the breadsticks killing the birds and you shoot your family. No, we don't want them to sponsor us. I don't think they will. Why would they? All right, I'll go fuck myself then bring it over and wants to sponsor us. Yeah, I mean if you want I'll go fuck myself. Thank you. I'd rather shoot myself in the face.	-1.0
Yeah, like if someone shuts you down and another phrase that uses cherry picker, you can't cherry pick. The Bible and what's convenient for you? And it's like well that phrase is really convenient because all you have to do is like and I remember feeling that way when I was saying these things to I knew that if you scratched a tiny bit below the surface, I would have to be like, I don't know shut up like like I don't have an answer be on don't trust your heart and I don't have an answer be on my pastor told me so so everybody shut up, you know, like well, I don't want people to fear that that's why I respect what you're doing. Doing so much and I don't see our channels or our ideals in major conflict. Actually.	-1.0
No, but I know I've said no to things in the past and they've done them. But at this point the thought of running around a little track for that long. Yeah, how about you? What I do. Yeah, the answer is I probably would ya he said what actually gets interesting. That's for sure. But yes, the truth is I would I would have a bash of that. Yeah, I think that would be oh, I think that would be a lot of men. To anguish in there for fun.	1.0
What's your youngest memory like the like the bare minimum of your fucking mind my dad teaching me to be a hit. How do you teach someone to be you?	1.0
Yeah, I want them when I would rather like have someone to make new experiences with rather than have the same routine every day, you know, so yeah. Okay Ricky. What's our last the last question? Would you rather go one year without your phone or like months without seeing a single person?	-1.0
Yeah. Well, I know quite a few home stages that have created that other Avenue of fairness. Fishing and styling airbnb's or holiday lips and I think maybe those complete bed furniture package is probably would complement that nicely if they are having to do an empty Air B&B. But yeah, I guess they changed cool.	1.0
I have to say as University. All right. Thank you so much.	1.0
I also wanted to point out. When did I? You know, this is this is part of the actual plot of the show. But like all of our at one point is like two feet from three people that he's close with Robbie Miley and Lily and he doesn't recognize any of them like something died down but like he knows their voices. You don't probably looks the same and I'm going to say this about the other ones who like, I don't know like he is Robby Ray and he always talks about Hannah Montana being his daughter.	-1.0
Yeah, that'll be a fun time in life. But I'm like good for another couple years. Yeah.	1.0
But I agreed with Michelle when Michelle was like this is one of My favorite hands down done.	1.0
I don't know. I don't know. I just got the call because I don't know Edition for Higher Learning. I think I got the call. I spoke with John and got the role.	-1.0
Well, yeah, but I don't - I'm saying fuck you guys ever been done to me. There's like no. I'm just saying the I text differently.	-1.0
When I don't like half a can of the of extra hot pink, let's fucking today like the junk food thing and you can just suddenly here because like I ate like the whole like half of can half of can half the half of kid and I like in like two minutes.	1.0
Like I have by accident, but then what o is real life on. Oh, no, it'd have to be to another person in real life.	-1.0
Yes, absolutely.	1.0
Well, I can shout right she'll be okay.	1.0
And I think we're on the right track for that. And so we're doing a lot of pre-production. Yeah. I was going to say we've started doing Production months ago and we don't even have our shooting dates are in April and April are ejected shooting date and we've already location scout it. I'm so excited for that one. It's uh, it's going to be so much fun. Can I tell him one of the locations for the movie? Yeah. We see that we scouted. Yeah, I do it we're shooting in a old video store. Yeah, and not only does it look like an old video store. It smells like an idiot.	1.0
That's just like that's a no on me.	-1.0
If you do not have the right technique you're going to eventually pick something up and yeah break your body eventually, right? So that's the first thing I've noticed there's like how they segmented the skill.	-1.0
Yeah, exactly. So who was engaged so I James I mean the whole time James got it. He got it. It was like like I like I was speaking to his soul and then I also felt like Jillian got it, but Jillian was Gillian was also incredibly, you know, she's Savvy as hell and so I mean like she is incredibly Savvy and so like A person like that can like you know, you think that they may have it but you're not sure until they say yes, you know and the other folks I could tell were like they're asking really good questions. So I think they were trying to get there but for whatever reason they couldn't respect, you know, but generally speaking, you know, I could tell that Jillian and James got it.	1.0
So and but then we started looking back and he started showing me old footage and he helped me believe that I was that which I really think helped me mentally and kind of give me confidence and put me in the right direction of the position that I wanted to be in. Yeah, so so now I am a DP and I go by being a cinematographer.	1.0
I agree with you that I think it should be like, I think they should revisit it for a limited time think Jessica. Test and see I think it'd be so cool to have like let's say the last three squads or something and then like a Titan drops and of course, you know, like the squads are going to run for the Titan. Yeah, because I think a lot of people who are against it and saying that a Titan might be too overpowered also doesn't realize that in Titanfall them if you're a pilot and you're not in the tighten your number one like your number one goal is the mantle that tighten and pull that battery out. The Titan is like dead within a couple seconds, right? Yes, like it would it would be testing it would change the gameplay. I love it. I would like it but I could see how people who might not be much of a Titanfall fan prior to Apex would be overwhelmed with a total of those people exist who played Apex without knowing about and it's playing Titanfall. I mean the player base is so much. Oh, that's a good point. I think they're really the last time they announced a milestone was like 50 mil. Yeah, right they like that. So I Like that definitely it wasn't what Titanfall 2 clocked but but who knows? Yeah, I mean, I feel like it would just it would just be nice just to have it and the game up a little bit so that it doesn't get into that kind of repetitious Lumpur has something people can look forward to that like old fans would be really excited for I think for sure.	1.0

Yeah, that's the way to go. That's the way to do it. But yeah, that's not the situation that we have today in the peripheral countries of the Eurozone the situation that we have there is that people are being used to being subsidized out of play. Chuckles yeah, the political leadership of those countries. They I mean in Asia 1997 your Thailand Indonesia. So on the leadership of those countries are no places elsewhere to go. They were stuck with their God their own country. Yeah. Okay, so they were dependent on getting the country back on the rails, but now the political Elites in Portugal and Spain Greece anywhere. Have you brought this lava and Slovakia Romania and so on I mean there Korea's a lot within their own countries and within the operators of the European Union, so they want to go to vassals. They want to have jobs that are created by the European Union lavishly funded so paid under with the same Revenue relation has similar jobs in Germany and so on but then in their own countries, so that's what they want. Their loyalty are not their own country. They are increasingly to this international organization.	-1.0

Hey guys, really love the podcast a ton. The only thing that would make me love it more is if I could listen to it while wearing boxers slides really enjoy both of your guys content and personalities and the podcast is always really funny. The only thing that could be improved upon. Oh is if launders would finally give white cloth a chance and stop with his blind hatred of such a delicious drink Lacroix is also good, especially the tall Earth in cans with the to flavor. Did you just write the second would be angrier about his opinions? If you didn't have such a great bull cut all of you including Nathan because he needs more love.

this is such a trip like we're all just doing our best and figuring things out at like a really Scribbly way and my thing it's like I forget everything I learn all the time. And so having people sort of bear witness to you and how you're doing and remember for you and you remembering for them and like everyone can like hold up a loving mirror and ask questions about why you believe the things you believe like Human beings are designed to need each other. And what's dope about that is it like once that need is met like it feels really good and it feels really safe and it feels really complete. And so even if you feel like a maniac especially if you're like a woman, especially if you are like a woman of color or you are just not like you're like average cishet, you know, like monoculture like mono conscious person who's like quote normal or a quote like skin-toned, you know, like yeah, like it's just a way to like take small defiant actions to like take up space and to like reaffirm your own agency, you know, not dump not like pollute not take advantage, but just like command that attention. Um and have and like amplifying other people and inviting them to do it to like, you know, I'm literally sitting here recording a mini pod on the floor about asking how are you like that's where I like that's the key to Wellness. Like it really really helps me and it's free. You know, so I hope you find some utility in that and I hope you have a gentle day and I hope you find small reassuring ways to accept the flavor of brain that you have in like hopefully grow to love it and appreciate it.	1.0

I think we should move on to our what I want to make fun of something real quick. Okay. So in Boston, they approved that heterosexual afraid the straight Pride Parade, like look, I'm straight and without saying anything that would get anyone upset. I understand why you know gay people I sexual and all the LGBT community are so you know kind of I don't want to say in your face, but also they're in your face about it not I'm not saying that in a bad way or anything. I don't want it like offend anyone but you know, they struggled for their rights for a long time and they finally, you know fun. selves equals and so they got afraid, you know, cool. They got a month cool puts out. The straight people are like we wanna pray. Yeah, we straight people definitely need to make up for all the Discrimination we faced over the years.	1.0
I'm the type of sports. That's why I'm happy for Clippers fans. Yeah, because I know die-hard clip is Fanny sucked for so long. On the Natalie dislike, yo, they got Mike I'm they deserve that right? So as a 49er fan, I can respect that.	1.0
Yeah, and that's the thing. You know, it's not that like here's a here's my justification. It's not that like we avoid doing the podcast but it's so easy to just keep doing what you're doing. You know, what's what what stays in motion this is what's the phrase the motion of the ocean keeps blowing? Okay, not the phrase I was thinking of is that is the worst quote I've ever heard.	1.0

Dude, that's the first head on The Chopping Block. Right? Each layoffs was painful. So I did some freelance in the middle there with some with you know, snowboarding companies at the time because that was kind of my only connection at the time, right?

They're just doing their shit, you know, yeah, you know, they okay. What's the big deal? They're trying to put order in government and Jedi are these radical fanatic religious zealots trying to take over the world using saying things like what stands in the way becomes the way, you know, using philosophy.

So I do time. The first time was amazing. It was three months to the day after the shark attack and I just had two stitches and Staples out of my leg. And all I wanted to do was get back in the water and two of my mates came over and they took me down to Bondi with a couple of surfboards and I was really paranoid about it because As a really populated beach in so I felt embarrassed and self-conscious and I've got my eight foot board under my arm and the paparazzi were there taking photos and so it was pretty hard to deal with but I'm hoping down through the soft sand and I get to the water and I can maneuver my way to about waist deep and I put my board down and the only thing I was worried about was I just whispered to myself. Please don't let me paddle around in a circle. I didn't I nearly drowned smashed by every single way. But eventually I got out the back and I was in the song sitting on my board with my mates and it felt so freaking good and you know, I try to remind myself that a lot when the running blade actually hurts a lot when I run I don't enjoy running that much anymore. But I remember how good I felt after I made that huge effort to get down to the beach to Get out into the waves, you know, it's not always about the struggle of doing something. It's about the happiness at the end and knowing and they're just living and that that it motivates me to get up off my ass a lot of the time when the alarms going off at 5:00 and I'm like, I don't want to go to the gym. It's cold out and but I know that feeling will come as soon as I'm out there doing it and living and so I always give myself a bit of a mental uppercut and Y'all started live. I've never ever regretted that but I've definitely regretted not doing things.	1.0
We can go a little longer and cover only got four of them. It'll probably take about two or three.	0.0
So there was an underwater camera that captured this whole thing was on the surface on the surface. Okay, man.	1.0
Yeah, you get pumped by stop and you just say, oh that was just a log or something. It's Rick yourself inside. I've had my knee. A guy in the water first for the first 30 minutes he a swimming up and back up and back and it's equipment trying to detect him and I decided to do him a good turn and I said just jump out mate. Let me take over take a break and I jump in the water in a black wetsuit a pair of black fins, and I'm on the surface on my back. Just moving from point A to point B, and I look over my left shoulder to make sure that I'm still headed towards the bow of the warship that I'm supposed to be attacking and before I can turn back I You have a huge whack in my leg and it didn't really hurt but it just kind of shocked me and I turned around to look and there's just a massive shock head touching me and takes me feels like seconds to work out what's going on because I've never even seen a shock and all of a sudden is this, you know, it's like Shark Week has come to life in front of me while I'm swimming and I don't really know what to do. And I think the shark knows what to do either because it's kind of staring at me and we try to work. You out if I'm food, and then so my survival instincts kick in and I think all right. I've seen the crocodile hunter. I've seen Shark Week over our job it in the eyeball. So I tried but I can't move my arm and I looked down and I can see the teeth embedded into my wrist and every time I try and pull it I can see the flesh tearing I was so I think nothing left hand I go to the eyeball with my left and I reach over but I can't reach it and in short side grab it by the nose and try to push it off, but that Is the type of the lower jaw deeper into the back of my leg. So I cut back to try and punch it in the nose and by that stage the Sharks decided on food and starts to shake me and that's when the paint kicks in like a hundred teeth razor-sharp teeth on either side of your limb moving in unison to tear through your flash and all of the fight went out of them took me under water and I was just yelling and I was in agony and we popped up and I took it. Breath and then it took me back under and just kept thrashing me around like a rag doll and I realized how powerful it was nothing I could do and so I realized that I was going to die and I remember thinking to myself. I'm not going home today. I'm going to die right now and it was strange because it wasn't like times flow down. I think our bodies and our minds are such incredible machines and my mind went into hyperdrive and I started running. My life is hanging. Okay, am I ready to die and I thought well shit no coming from where I started out as a really lost and bad kids self-harming and drugs and all that stuff and fighting and stealing to where I had achieved Peace Keeping with the UN and the elite of the Navy and all that sort of stuff and I thought you know what I'll come further than I've ever thought possible if I'm going to die now I have no regrets. I'm ready to go. And so I let go and I was ready to drift away and the A shark at that point ripped through the rest of my leg and took my hand off and because it wasn't attached to me anymore. My wet suit made me boy and I'll pop to the surface and I realized that I wasn't dead and I thought shit. I got to get out of here before it comes back and I saw my safety boat with my three teammates in and I start to swim to the safety boat. But as soon as I take a stroke, I can see my hands gone. It just my arm ends at the end of my wetsuit and my medical training kicks in and I think I've got to keep that wound above my heart to stem the bleeding. So I've got one out of the water swim back to the boat with one hand and one leg because I can't even feel my right leg. I don't know what's wrong with it at this point. I just can't feel it. And the guys in the safety boat said I was literally swimming through a pool of my own blood and they said when they came in closer, he was actually so stick they could taste it in the air and I just I didn't think I was going to make it. I thought there's so much blood in the water sharks will come back and other sharks going to smell it and I'm going to die. I'm just waiting for a shock to grab me. By the other leg and it just never came so I just kept swimming back to the boat and eventually the guys got to me pulled me out of the water and just out of the sheer relief of not being eaten any more. I relax my eyes rolled back in my head and I pass out and my mate almost brings into action and his training tells him. I'm going into cardiac arrest and he needs to stimulate my heart. So he straddles me and he starts pummeling me in the chest. I'm trying to wake me back up and and it work. And I wake up and I look over and my hands gone freshly bitten off by a shark and I look up and tell me who's beating the shit out of me and I just think today sucks.	-1.0

It's something I never get sick of telling because because I love this lady with all my heart. So when I started teaching I moved two and a half hours away from home. I knew like obviously my wife's family. That's but that's all I knew up here. I didn't know any teachers. I know nothing about the school Trish and I I moved to a town near her hometown. So we were near her family and I started this job at an amazing team that took me in there under their wings and we just we got along super great and we just had a blast together. And at the time we were a team of three teachers and I kept hearing these stories about this teacher who was now in the junior high level. Her name was honor Trotter and she had taught kindergarten. Actually. My room was her kindergarten room before I came and I got to know honor a little bit over the first couple years of teaching because she was doing A junior high like I don't science work, but she's also doing reading Specialists work on our end. So my kids got to go see her every now and then and I just I would spend my break. I know that seems like a weird word and education so we don't really get those but my break with my students would actually get time as a class to go see honor in Reading tight like that await a specific dedicated reading block that she got to take kids and do awesome activities. I found myself not taking a break but sitting and watching her and I was amazed at the way this woman taught and II guess our school didn't really have an official Mentor program at the time but I considered her my mentor because I learned more from her than I ever did from any textbook or any course I ever took and it it wasn't just about teaching it was just about the way she interacted with with not just students but human beings and I use that term a lot when I go out and speak that we need to treat these people in our classrooms and our lives not as students that are walking through a door. But his people is anybody else wants to be treated, you know, so I learned a lot from her on that subject and then When she was close to retirement, she actually came back to kindergarten she joined our kindergarten because our numbers were growing and she went to our board and our Administration said listen. I know you're going to be hiring kindergarten. Please. Let me finish up my career there where I started and of course they were like, yeah, let's do it. So I want to say I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but maybe the last five six seven years of her career were spent in kindergarten and I got to be a part of her team. It was it was awesome. We were team before for a while then a team of five them sema4 went back and forth, but it was always Myself, my neighbor Tiffany and Lori who were my three what I started and then honor it was always the four of us plus another 1 or minus another one and honored just to just was just an awesome person in the working with and getting to learn from her and then two years before she was about to retire. She was kind of forced into early retirement because she was diagnosed with cancer that forced her to stop teacher Chic. She had to take care of herself as she was weakening. She only made it about nine months. After she was diagnosed and I'll never forget when she called me up one day. I still remember I was laying on my couch watching a movie phone rings. It was like a Saturday and it was her and she was he come over for a minute and she lived like a half hour from where I live. So it's like yeah. Yeah, like what what's up, you know and my daughter was I think to at the time so she was probably napping and I just looked at Trisha. I'm like I need to go to honors house and she's like for what it's like I really don't know and I knew that she had been out and having some medical issues. I didn't know that it was going to be big and she sits me down a couch and tells me that she has cancer and of course as anybody would I lost it I started crying and I didn't know what to think and she didn't shed a tear. She's smiling at me and I looked at him like what are you doing? Like, how are you know said she goes she goes I've cried out of my I cried when I got the diagnosis, but she goes I've learned to accept the fact that there's a reason that I have cancer and and how it blew my mind. I mean, I probably jaw dropped look they're like, what do you mean there's a reason like no, there's no For a reason for this and she truly was the most hopeful person in the world. She believed that there was a purpose to her being diagnosed with cancer and I know the stories going on. I apologize for rambling but there's a point to this there really is. So I guess the point this is that that there was never specific lesson from her that she came out and said this is the way you should be treating people or here's a lesson on kindness or here's a lesson on bullying or is she there was never a specific thing that I recall a my mind at all it started with that moment when she Said to me there's a purpose for this and at that time I had no idea that it was becoming it was I had no idea. I mean no one thought she's gonna pass away as fast. She did we just we didn't really know and then when we lost honor we never got to find out what she thought her purpose was, right? So honored passed away nine months after diagnosis, May 6th of 2013 and the week after her funeral or that actually three days after she passed away was her birthday birthday is May 9th and on that day our entire Will went out back and we bought I don't remember how much I think we bought 60 because it was gonna be on her 60th birthday on May 9th. We bought 60 yellow balloons and released them one of our past PE teachers who had taught With Honor for 30 plus years brought little yellow bracelets to the school for everyone like rubber bracelets, you know that said honoring Honor on them. She given to every student staff member like thousands of these bracelets were headed out and I just remember being out on this lawn with our entire School telling stories of her microphone. Everybody got to kind of share their story about honor that was close to her. We sang Happy Birthday. We let these balloons go and and something about that day and the I don't have image the balloons were yellow honors favorite color was yellow. So that's the reason for the yellow balloons the yellow bracelet. She just loved the color yellow and that day became an image. I guess that was etched into our school forever now because it's continued but so fast forward again, and that year went on we all made it. Through the school year a new year started and then things started to seem kind of weird as they would if you lost, you know a family member best friend are our building just didn't seem the same we knew she was still there, but we can still hear her laugh in the hallway. We knew she was there but something struck me as something I guess important in the fact that I needed to find a way or we as a team or a teacher group or a school need to find a way to keep her alive in our building as much as possible and to do that on my end. I mean, we've all done our own share of things of sharing her story of an item. High-end, I wrote a book about her and it was a book called yellow that Shameless plug here. You can find on Amazon or you know, you don't have to buy my book. You can go to my YouTube channel teachers learn to dot common and see a free video of me reading it to your class. So check that out. But anyway, I wrote this book as a way to keep her alive because I felt there were so many students and staff cheated out of getting to know her and I felt lucky that I got to write. So I wrote this book. I got to start traveling around to schools as an author of all things which Blew my mind because I just wrote this just for her, you know sharing honor story. And the reason that was brought up was because her story was all about just making people happy and there's a line on the book that says Honor made people's gray skies into yellow Skies or turn people's gray skies and yellow skies because that's what she did and it wasn't. I mean, I know there's so many kindness campaigns out there then they're all great, but hers wasn't about doing anything for anyone. It wasn't about doing a random act of kindness. It was more so that she got people to realize the good in. Side themselves just like being the person she was and I know that sounds kind of confusing but I don't know how she did it. But she made you feel like the best person in her life. No matter what it was and she just found a way to make everybody smile and make you very happy. Yeah, and that's the kind of kindness that she spread was just getting other people to feel good. It wasn't going out of her way to do anything. She was just that type of human being she made everybody feel special special. Yeah an important and noticed, you know, And she made you feel good about yourself. She brought out something in me that I don't know. I'd ever experienced before you know, so I keep saying this but fast forward again and I think three or four years after she had passed away we decided to keep her birthday celebration going but even more and Anna term had come up from my book called make someone's day yellow and we just kept using that over and over again in our building would skip say to make someone's day LSA make someone's day yellow today rather than saying like pay it forward. We just said make someone's day yellow And we decided to do that. So we on May 9th three years ago, four years ago. Whatever. The first one was. We decided to celebrate honors birthday at our school with what we call Yellow day and we did just kind things all day long. We decorate our entire school to look yellow. I mean balloons streamers posters. Everything was turned yellow we did do random acts of kindness for people around the building. So we delivered like flowers to the secretaries and just rope notes to teachers and random people saying smile today are hope you have the best day ever. Or thank you for being you just things that honor would have done without really knowing them we decided to do purposefully, right and after it happened after yellow to happen. I videoed the whole thing. I put on my YouTube channel and about two weeks after the day. I got a message from a teacher and I look at the location. It was from Australia, and it blew my mind that someone lost really was even watching my little YouTube channel, right? I looked at the comment and said thank you for sharing this message. We're going to try to do a yellow day at our school and I I remember running to school the next day like oh my gosh you guys check this out someone in Australia is going to do our celebration like it's going to spread and then these emails and messages started coming in at one after another after another after another and and over the past three years of doing yellow day at our building and then spreading around other schools and other states and other countries we've hit I think eight different countries where we've seen yellow Day celebrated and 35 different states within the u.s. I can't count the number of schools that it's reached. The number of people it's reached but yellow day has become a movement is what we've used the term as As you know and going back to an honor was diagnosed and what this all meant. I truly believe that everything that happens in your life is done for a purpose whether you want to believe in a higher being or not or what your beliefs are. It doesn't matter to me. Everything happens for a reason. Let's not deny that fact there's a reason behind everything that happens and I never forget two years ago on the other day when it was really getting big and blowing up. We were getting messages from schools left and right and people post on social media like picture after picture after picture after picture. A bunch of us teachers were standing outside my classroom door talking and showing sharing images of images that we were tagged in after school. And one of our first grade teachers Donna walks by and she goes this is it Adam and I said, excuse me, and she is this is the purpose and I said, what do you mean and she goes this is why honor had cancer and I lost it like a probabilistic. I lost it. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's true. Like we never got to find out what honor believed her purpose for having cancer was until that day and we truly feel like her reason for being diagnosed.	1.0

Evenly when I start this with my teams. They all look at me as if I am treating them like children around the second or third week. They get more excited and their answers get weirder as they become more comfortable with everyone. This reinforcement bonds them all and gives them things to talk about A Works towards my value of the team getting along. It's weird. How much to girls can Bond over both loving turquoise discipline. You've already created rules and discuss them both with your players as well as their families. Everyone is on the same page. Let's say you have some pretty basic rules like no kicking the ball. No swearing no side conversations during Huddle's Etc. So what happens when one of your girls gasp breaks one of these rules, this is a major decision. You need to make before the season. Ins because the first time it happens it sets a precedent. Are you going to let it slide? Will you give out warning after warning yet do nothing about it in the end or will you stop everything and send your players to the service line and make them run until you think you get the point across drop in the middle of a match and do push-ups as former players. We probably all experienced differing disciplinary Styles coming from our coaches maybe even differences from the same coach depending on their mood the head coach may have been extremely strict while the assistant was. Mainly there to encourage the girls on your team while you don't come into your first season wondering what sort of punishment your team will serve for various offenses. It is something you need to decide on make sure your other coaches are on the same page. Not sure where to start think about this. The whole point of discipline is to make your girl stop some sort of behavior. Usually one. They know they shouldn't do but decide to engage in any way. The best punishment is one that they do not want and will therefore try to avoid some rules one, bro. Are more detrimental to the team than others kick a ball out of the way when peppering not good, but likely just a reflex give them a warning Buddha ball across the gym after missing a dig. She's sitting out no questions asked which leads me to my next point my personal approach to rule-breaking is this you break a rule you sit out everyone knows the rules and I don't have the time or patience to give warnings in very rare circumstances. I'll give a warning but because my team's know that I'm a no-nonsense coach when it comes to breaking the rules warnings are rarely necessary while different age groups will have different kinds of rule-breaking you need to decide on punishments which are consistent with your temperament and coaching style. I don't personally agree with punishments such as running lines push-ups laps. What have you this gives those activities a negative connotation and I want my girls to want to do those things to be in better shape. I do make one exception to running as discipline simply because a former coach of mine used it and I think it's genius Swearing was not allowed on the team. And if someone decided they were going to cuss the entire team will get mad at them. But why why would a player be mad at another player for breaking a rule depending on the number of letters in the word of choice? That is how many laps the team had to run but wait, it gets better the person who swore would stand in the middle of the court or jam and count the number of laps out loud for the rest of the team. My old coach used pure pressure against us to curb our attitudes I can Practically guarantee that if you implement this rule with your team swearing will be minimal whatever disciplinary policies you decide on make sure you stay consistent in your enforcement of the rules. Just because one of the girls who has never once gotten in trouble is having a side conversation during a huddle do not let it go fairness is something girls are very sensitive to particularly when they feel it is going against them giving up the perception of playing favorites can be just as damaging to their trust in you as if you are actually playing favorites. Practice design one of the topics I'm most passionate about when it comes to volleyball is practice design organizing skill practice and game like drills in a way that builds up and culminates in proper skill execution is vital to running a successful practice. It is crucial that you spend more than just a few minutes coming up with practice until you are a seasoned coach and even then you'll probably spend more time tweaking drills to make practice just right. So let's talk about practice design what I mean by practice design is the a flow of your practices from one major category of skill work or Play Games Etc on to the next to begin. You always need to warm up. This should take roughly 10 minutes for each practice to make sure your girls have warmed up their muscles properly the rest of how you spend your time will vary depending on how long your practices are with younger players practicing for shorter amounts of time usually and can be broken up as follows Dynamic stretching stretches that make your players move warm-up game a game. That gets the players moving and playing volleyball but uses them into play there should not include scrimmaging and should limit full serves or attacking right away games with a lot of movement are ideal skill demonstration and concept introduction explain a new skill or concept for this example. I'll use jousting Jousting is one two players on opposing chords go up to direct a ball that is tight to the net and could end up on either side. This may be too advanced for younger teams, but is a good skill to practice. Of 12 and under or middle school volleyball explanation should take no longer than five minutes unless it is very complex skill or concept specific drill. Now you run a drill which focuses on the new skill or Concept in our case jousting and sure you are running a drill which is slow down enough to focus on good technique, but quick enough to get a lot of touches on the ball and keep their attention game like activity which incorporates skill or concept similar to the warm-up game. We're not getting into full-on scrimmage. Out here. We just want to put the girls in a game situation in which has everyone practicing jousting as if it were happening in the game playing a short Court game where players can only tip will help the jousting situation arise more often old / familiar skill demonstration. Since Jousting is not typically one of the first skills you cover you are probably a few weeks or a month into your season by the time this comes up your team should be familiar with their defensive positions by now so you can review defense at this time. Sighs tip coverage as this is related to jousting scrimmage, which incorporates both skills and or concepts now is the time you get to test out how well your players have grasped the new information you have given them by running a full scrimmage. You are allowing your players to get in the habit of implementing their new skills in a way that would naturally occur in a game. Not one that is forced or predictable cool down. Your players have probably put a lot of effort into the last 15 to 20 minutes of practice and need to ease into their normal state. Cooldowns do not need to take very long but should not be skipped. Also, it's very important to incorporate water breaks for the team. If someone is thirsty during a drill that you should also allow them to get water right away schedule these in but make sure your players know that they can get water at any time. This is a safety issue. This does not by any means have to be followed religiously at every practice. However, if you are struggling to create a schedule for your practice in this might be a great place to start some nights, you may also have skills, which do not easily work. Whether using this framework, for example, you need to work on serving and setting it can be hard to make these two skills. Mesh.	1.0
Yes, you know, I think I think I want to agree with Betty during this and just say that he's honestly probably just lonely and Confused from what I'm seeing. I think he's very trustworthy but he just doesn't know maybe who is his true friend. Like he said he got dropped from the farm. He felt very lost. But he lost his friends because he joined the farm. So he just needs to really be with his friends and really gain there. Trust back I think and we have a lot of people in the chat. Yes who are agreeing and they're saying that Kevin is we got a rune who Cote? I'm sorry if I butchered your name, but he says who's trust who trust Kevin is true to Betty and helps her or is he trying to get back in? What do you think think he's helping her? Maybe? He's just trying to get back in some sort of a friendship grazed or he's just lonely.	1.0
Yeah, well, I think that is a really good point and it still is intuitive because when we make certain decisions about what we eat, we're always weighing our values against each other. So in the moment if you like, what are you going to value with the decisions that you make around food? So are you valuing convenience and ease or are you on another situation or another day valuing like feeling good in your body or feeling like one day is it spontaneity? JT and then the next day. It's like Integrity because you told yourself you were going to you know, eat a certain way and so it's okay for those values to change on a day-to-day basis and you always need to check in with yourself again to figure out like what am I what value am I honoring with this decision around my food? Also. It's like we all just have we all have different values and different priorities and you know, I'm a chef. I'm somebody who loves to cook so I know you would always say like you're so not lazy. I actually think it's fun to make my own cashew milk and I enjoy the taste if you don't it's okay not to do all those things, but can you find you know, can you still find balance and challenge yourself to maybe step out of your comfort zone a little bit if you do prioritize your health and if you do want to take care of your body without it being like a chore because if it's a chore, you're just not going to do it ever or stick to it, right?	1.0

Teachers as well, but I felt like Allstate had the best set of features. So I was like, yeah was he is he kind of cheating on this? Like I still thought that he had the best the best album out of the three, but the features like if you're looking at it from that perspective that the county is cheating like because it's like damn can you do any dope song by yourself, but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because I still enjoy like the majority of the songs on here.	-1.0

They were you don't all of a sudden get that mindset after you've done something bad. They did not care about her like they acted like they really cared about her that night, but they didn't if they didn't really care about her at all because they couldn't put aside their differences for like 10 minutes.	-1.0

And again, you're just super grateful of a be there and you look around just like the best hip-hop and contemporary dancers and Jazz dancers old from all over the world and credible. It's so it was so so cool. So that decision was super easy. We're like, all right. Let's try, you know, try something new. We've never done that before and we are so grateful we did and we did. Make it that far but like we definitely got great exposure from there's people started contacting us and recognizing us for what we do and that was the biggest thing and it was just again, we're just super grateful to be there.	1.0

Welcome to the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host Jake shorter. And today I am joined by Jessica Dwyer of right at home staging which is located on the sapphire Coast in New South Wales. There's a couple of things in particular probably three that I found really interesting about this interview. The first one is that just is located in her business is located in a very Regional or even rural area and I guess we talked about some of the difficulties that she faces as part of that and I know that she's not alone in that in around Australia. We also talked about The fact that the her staging business is only one of two businesses that she runs she actually has a retail physical retail store as well. So I talked a bit about how that fits in with her staging business how it complements it and also the difficulties in running two businesses at the same time. And the third one that we get into is a little bit of an online shop idea that she's had to help increase or add another revenue streams part of her staging business and in particular she has set up a dream packages. That she sells locally to various people and and I found it really interesting. And I know that she's not alone in setting up an online store as a another source of Revenue. So we kind of talked about her thoughts behind it and what she has found very successful and difficult in saying that up. She also finishes, I guess the interview with an answer to my question which I often ask but don't get a great answer which is what is something weird or unusual that you love actually has a really good answer which I actually do the same thing. Going to tell you what it is yet. You have to listen to the end to get that but I suspect its more common than we both or then she realized I think it's actually probably more common in the general population. So listen and let me know how you go with that one. Enjoy the episode. Okay, I'm joined today by just for Dwight from right at home staging. How are you going? Yes, I'm good. Thank you Jake. How are you? Very well, welcome to the show.	1.0
Yeah with my disgusting burp. I apologize for any one who had to hear that. So last two weeks ago. We did the worst parent teachers episode. And basically we got through bedtime and a couple other times it's dinner time and some other shit and there's a lot of stuff we didn't get to and we had so many comments and so many different little topics within it that we wanted to finish it off. So that's what we're doing today and the first One of the top of the paper maybe not the top of the list but the top of the paper that I put together is homework. So today my kid gets home and he has to do like reading responses once a month where he has to do basically like a really brief book report on whatever book He's reading. I had to sit down with him and like help them structure it because like each there's three paragraphs and each one has to have kind of a different thing. I'm sitting with them and I much prefer this to math homework with him because the mass shit. I can't even do half it like it's getting more snow. He's in fourth grade is getting more sophisticated in the Common Core just the principles of it are tough. And before you start bashing Common Core. Yeah. I find it difficult. I understand the rationale behind it essentially is to give you like mechanisms be able to do math in your head in a more logical way the kind of the way that we do it like if you're breaking up a tip. You divide it by 10 you do all that shit right away with not really how we were taught. We were taught memorization and all that shit. Whatever. I'm not going to get in a comic or different app.	-1.0

Three people who made serious mistakes sir. I who took matters into her own hands and gave her servant to Abram Abram who went along with the plan but when circumstances began to go wrong, he refused to help solve the problem, right? Because I believe he says he says well, she's your servant like deal with her as You want you know and then you have Hagar who ran away from the problem, but in spite of this messy situation that all three of these people get themselves in God demonstrates his ability to work in all things for good right Romans 8:28. That is that that is like one of my favorite. I think that's a lot of people's favorite verse.	-1.0

Oh, yeah great non-roma. How about you and just like turn that around so quickly like Like like it's like a judo move. And now I just like really take that as a sign to check in and I just pretend that people care about my response no matter how sheepish I feel about it and how embarrassed I feel about it. And now I feel like it's like a sign of weakness which high like what is like, where did that come from?	1.0
Dad. You know what that means? He's like calling all his fucking know and once we were there for like 12 hours straight and once But they had like taco stands and everything will at the border man, those hot dogs were fucking lit, but I prefer Mexican hot dogs over any type of dogs.	1.0
Then you get ready. Then you give them the naloxone you bring them up slow. It's way safer. Yeah you then they'll come up they get a little confused. They pull their way out and then they'll start talking to you. Some of them come to the hospital. Some of them don't someone tell us to peace out. But yeah, we want these people to be transported to the hospital or at least if they refuse service to be with somebody to be monitored because Locks on will have a shorter shelf life. It will burn off faster in their system than the opiates.	1.0
So I just feel like being very body positive and I try to like also like bring that out and others It's because I don't I don't think I've talked about this on the podcast yet. But I've had this like weight loss Journey where I was 300 pounds. I still like felt pretty good in my skin at that time. But I've lost like I don't know like a hundred and twenty pounds no big deal. It's like but like learning to like love yourself at both sides and seeing your imperfections because I still feel at this size like not good enough. And like not hot enough and what has really helped me accept myself is actually nudes. If I'm being 100% honest. I've gone from a size 0 to size 6 back down back up and I can find flaws at any size. But I think at some point you just have to look for the things you love as opposed to like picking out the things that you hate right and I still definitely picked myself up are same but it's so helpful to be like, oh my God look at me. I look at like what this body has accomplished always want to look at you. I always want to look at you and I do girlfriend. Look at them bubs. Oh my God, so I guess that's that's the T if you want to take a sip.	1.0

Yeah, so I have another question about your training. So you spend a fair bit of what I know about you spent your run by feel you don't really tape up but and you somewhere along the line you recover. I don't know how so you've obviously got a bit of a Natural disposition or maybe just from years of running until dropping pretty decent base, but do you ever have any major troubles with the engines?	1.0
maximize drawer space and then I realized I was storing some framed decorations that were just things that you know, I got in at thrift stores or whatever that I wasn't using at my current house and I thought you know what I'm just going to I'm just going to get rid of these because they're taking up space in one of my clothing drawers and they probably been in there since we moved so sometimes I have to thin down my drawers and part of it is hanging things up or I found a sweater that should be hanging up.	-1.0
Or maybe you have time to work in a kid's room today. Like if you if you keep your master bedroom just really clean and your bed was made a sec the second you got out of it.

I want her this big like over the top hat that if you clap twice the lights come on and it's just so funny.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, I don't really do that.	0.0
okay, so chapter 16 of Genesis had me kind of laughing because it it reminds me of just how we are as wives sometimes but this chapter is so rich in just how it can relate to today and that's why I love the Bible man because there is like if you you just read through just to get through right to just like check it off your list. Then you are missing you are missing some good stories on you are missing some good lessons. And and so let's dig in. Okay chapter 16 is the birth of Ishmael Ishmael. You know what I'm just gonna apologize beforehand for how I pronounce some of these names, but basically it's the birth of Who comes from sarai's servant? So Abram who later is named Abraham and Sarai who's later named Sarah. So Abram and Sarai have been told by God in earlier chapters. Well Abram has been told that he's going to be a father of a bunch of Nations. Right but they are very old and Sarai decides to take matters into Her own hands because she is so old and wants to have a baby that she gives hag are her servant to Abram. Now when I first read this or like when I've heard about this in the past, I was always like how scandalous like that was. Okay, you know because it doesn't really condemn them in the Bible. It's not like God comes down and it's like how dare you sleep with another woman when you're married Abram, right? Like but here's the thing like it's not right. It's not right. It God does not say that that is okay. But Sarai gives her servant to her husband, which was not uncommon back in that day and It was actually a common practice of that day. If a married woman could not have children. She would have like a substitute wife. So one of her servants have a child with their husband to produce heirs in Abram and Sarai we know had wealth right livestock and land and all of that. So and I believe it's in a previous chapter of Genesis that Abrams like I have no errors like my servants gonna inherit it or my servants kid. You know, whatever. So let's that's like an overview right but this is so rich in lessons. Let's get into it. So Genesis 16 starts with now Sarai Abrams wife had not been able to Bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. So sir. I said to Abram the Lord has prevented me from having children go and sleep with my servant perhaps I can have children through her and Abram agreed with surprise proposal. So Sarai Abrams wife. Took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. This happened Ten Years After Abram had set settled in the land of Canaan. So we all know what happened right Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant, but when hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt. So let's back up though really quick to Abram going and sleeping with Hagar. Abram was acting in line with the custom of the day. Right? So it was common for that to happen. But his action showed a lack of faith that God would fulfill his promise. So what are something this is like the question that I asked myself what are some things that are acceptable today by the world, right? What are some things that are in line with the custom of today?	1.0

Just dangling on a rope waiting for a shark to come out of the murk speaking of sharks for those people don't know I mentioned it briefly which is a huge like understatement was passed by so quickly.

Challenger maybe, but Naomi had to do it and you wouldn't think Naomi is like this like top Valentina is the girl who does nothing at the school project will put her name on them. So I was like perfectly. I just I felt like she when she was talking to both of them. I felt like in her head. She I mean we all know she lives in her own world, but I feel like she thought they're not going to send me home because of her relationship with them and because In her head she deserves to be in the finale that being said anybody, you know, it's like you can say that but then you can't say that Latrice can't think the same thing because that was the issue before was that Latrice is like why I've been around a long time. I deserve to be here. I shouldn't have gone home. Then you can't be mad. You didn't mean does that make sense? Well, thank you can't be mad at me choose for saying it and then B and then be okay with Valentina going we are well I shouldn't be because I'm fabulous well. Latrice is fabulous. I'm sorry Sheila made herself. I think yeah, absolutely. She said absolutely I didn't do anything. Yeah, we'll go. Well and even when she says give me a reason to keep you. She just said do what you think is best and I think that in when I heard that I went she thinks you're not going to send her home. So she's just telling you to do what you need is a great social player because she said yourself a few times. Yeah, but you know, the third time really wasn't her child in her favor. She wouldn't last one Survivor.	-1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, that's great. Well, I really love following all the different businesses on Instagram and watching them grow. You just reminded me of something that I was in my early. Sighs I did make contact with a lot of real estate agents and I didn't hear from a few of them and then at least 12 months later one of them replied to my email. So it's like they kind of knew were there but they didn't really need you with that time or they weren't really convinced. You could help them at that time that they they eventually came around. So it's a nice like pass very slow burn slow so bad. Yeah.	1.0

Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's a lot of people's like I I definitely I think the first time I technically heard of it. Clean prints gaming and he's he talked about it. And he was like, you know, oh, hey, here's the secret project. I think even had the name of that Apex Legends. I don't know if like, I don't know if he knew that it was the real name or whatever. Like I don't know what his sources are but like he was actually talking about the fact that it was going to be a battle or who's going to be a battle royale that it wasn't going to be in the TitanFall Universe. I don't think he said anything about classes. So there was a few things that he got wrong, but that was actually the first time I ever heard of it and I'm like Well, that's kind of cool. I mean, I like a lot of people, you know, love Titanfall 2 and it came out and yeah, it was very much. It was very much the same thing you were saying just like well dang it, you know every they were put to they were put to death by EA and so for for it to kind of turn around into this was probably one of the most amazing things. I mean the little a lot of people kind of already talked about it, but it's just the fact that is like hey, you know this game that we made well, it's already And it's like wait. What?	1.0
Yeah, that's what it literally is a demon though, but in a different way, but she was like you need to go to literal like well, yeah. Fuck you, bitch. Yeah, and then she was like she tried to tell me that well, I was at the time I was like I was a lot younger so I was like so like, oh do I like girls and she was like, yeah demons can make you think homosexual thoughts and I was like, oh no, that's why I like titties. Like bitch know I like titties kiss titties are greater. Great.	-1.0

I went back to work full-time after six months. Wow. Are you serious? Yeah. So one of my greatest be the will the greatest be wasn't about Losing the leg in the hand. It was about losing my career because it's called it was it was everything to me. I loved it and I fought so hard to achieve that and I was terrified of losing it and so instead of letting that fear crippled me. I used it as a motivator and I let it push me into die with you know, just two days after my legs chopped off. I'm trying to do one-handed pull-ups on the bar above my bed so that I can start training and then I went home and I had one of my best friends who Really was a savior. He quit his job up north moved in with me and act as a carer and cooked for me and clean for me and drove me around. I really couldn't have done it without him. You can't undervalue the just the smallest amount of support in these situations. And so I was in the gym at the army base every single day training learning to use my body again working with the prosthetic companies to try and develop weightlifting Prosthetics. And so yeah over a year and a half to have three More surgery to remove bone spurs and that was always very hard progressing and then going in for surgery and going back to square one again. So that was pretty emotionally draining and having to get back on the drugs again, and I was self-administering Oxycontin and own which is the fast-acting oxy Gabapentin, which is a nerve blocker antidepressants for the nerve pain sleeping tablets. And so I could smash as much of that in my head as I wanted, but I kind I knew what it was like to live in a cloud. Cloud from when I was a teenager and I was smoking heaps a weed and was working in Hospitality doing other party drugs and I swore to myself. I wouldn't go back to that person. And so I got off the drugs as fast as I could got back to work and just started trying to prove myself that I deserve to be there.	1.0

So basically the all the kids that we have that we hand out that general public get there's ampules point 4 mils per milliliter of Apple of the naloxone in the kits and there's three samples per kit with three syringes and there's also nasal atomizer naloxone that people get handed out as well majority of the law enforcement's usually have those There are four milligrams. They work pretty well. However, the majority of the ones that are handed out are all the inter muscular injectable injectable kits. So those ones that we talked about are just wanted to really expose everybody on what's in the kit how to properly use it then we talked a lot about how to actually recognize and respond to an opiate overdose. And we talked about some of the myths of of the overdose responses as well. So this is just for us. Nervous system depressants from opiates specifically and not certain certain stimulants.	-1.0

I can only run after I drop my daughter off at school. I've have my own business and work from home. So normally I get up super early do some work dropped off at school. They both of my run after 9:00. And so it's really hot but even so the weekend Is so but but I guess I just know to really take it easy. I just dialed it back. I kind of knew what I was in for hate liars. That's not to say I didn't feel it. I've I did think I drank 17 made this place of water throughout the day went. Well, this is yeah, but that's not an exaggeration. Yeah, I just took it as slow and I just knew I just I guess I didn't know what I was doing for in terms of the weather. Yeah.

Yeah, and that's one thing we did. I mean that's why we put them on our trucks initially as well as is. Yes. Anybody can be trained to use this cat like there is young children that know how to use these kits and can can administrate them. However, you know for us responding we needed a plan. We need an operational guideline for a second as Bowser for us because I've seen it numerous First I'm the and I'm sure many other people have is where you're either in a residence or your Patty somebody down or you're trying to get them into the back of the ambulance or it's in a car accident where there's a lot of paraphernalia left over or sitting close to them. So if you get exposed to that and we need a plan for our size, so if we're not carrying it, we're not prepared then if we come across something and we need to administer it it's still there for us and you're totally covered under the Good Samaritan. I can be see anyways.	-1.0

So it's not like spiritually, but of course mentally and physically there really are Moving the forward towards that direction. So CrossFit was really introduced to us by our church. Finally started.

Discuss anything other than running we do you mean running is a big topic of conversation and I'm sorry, we do believe it or not do other things and have all that interested, you know for sure running is a passion for both of us and we do talk about a garage sale. Yeah, we've a savings of little bit differently. Sometimes other people I think laid back about this square is called can be very focused which is fantastic. It's kind of its. Yeah great. However, he could have a Golf and just put it out there. Whereas if I have a goal a bit more guarded about it. I'm not ready to put it out there that is just to put it out there and he'll achieve it. Yeah, he's a great brother. Yeah, he's definitely a good runner. I'm sure private you are so I want you to run through all of your races this year because just What kind of rice no with you but of wrong with you, it was run different events at the same main event and it would appear that I've taken weekends off and you've raced every weekend that's it seems to me so it seems like a year of writing. Well not quite every weekend. But yeah, I'm not a fan of taking time off. I just do as I said things. The fall off when I do that, but I did tell her we're in my life in February this year. I did the I do that with Carl and I did the Brisbane Valley real Colonel Marlowe this year, which I did last year and last year and I actually collapsed a few hundred meters from the finish it my body went into shock, but I've made it I made it to the end with 20 minutes to spare. So I made it I think. 29 hours 40 minutes and this year I finished third third be mailing or just over 21 hours. So I learned a lot from that from last year. I was going to climb so high this year, but it got cancelled. So I did my own bun a high of 50 around being on the same day. So if quote century and soon at your Mantra and a couple of other smaller ones as well, I've done the see that we were traveling series most of that this year and yeah. So you've done about a thousand cases of racing? Is here I'm not good at maths if you say so actually and it's about I think it's a lot. It's a lot of racing. Yeah in strawberryland stronger, but really to make it easier to get my runs on to run down under and love on the weekend just popped over 5,000 cases for the year. Oh, wow.	1.0
Um, so yeah finding a professional that works will be that's not homophobic. That isn't crazy. ABS is not easy all the time. Genuinely and where that hasn't been through anything. So we're like well, maybe you should meditate. Yeah, you're just not going to buy with some of them. Yeah, like, you know, like when you're going to school if I go to like college, I went to UMass for three years and there were so many girls that were getting psyched agrees. That just made me laugh because I was like, you literally have no empathy but you don't understand through any psyche at all because you learn you can read about it in a book. Yeah you can read about Like anxiety, but if you don't have anxiety, you just don't know what it's like. Yeah, and these are the same girls that II that something goes wrong with their friends they call up their fucking mental health with their school and send them away. You know, like they do not there they do not know or care even to take the time to understand the emotion that you're feeling. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of it is just like making an effort to understand what your friends are going through and like my thing is Don't treat people the way you want to be treated treat them the way they want to be treated sometimes like yes and have you don't understand? Yeah, like yeah. We're not the same time just to say yeah, how can I support you? Hmm? Yeah, like I've been having a rough month my good friend just said what can I do to make sure that you're safe and to provide you support that's really weird. And if we're good sighs. Do you want to give you want to give your friend support? Yep, without being their therapist. You can still ask for support like that's where humans me. That you know, yep, and I literally told her send me a meme or two. I'll hit you up when I need you. Yeah, sometimes it's as simple as a setting for someone that's sad like so and just being like I'm here, you know living in talk. We cannot talk we can watch TV at like my presence shows that I care. Definitely. I don't have the words for it. Yeah, you know. So I guess that's how to help a depressed friend is just to be there for them. Yeah and like and not give up on them. Even if they don't come to all your social Gatherings key inviting them. Yeah, because they want to know the people still love them. Yeah, and that just reinforces like, oh no one loves me like, you know, just like invite them places, like even if they don't go like kind of have the expectation that like if you're like plans are going to like if you make plans with them like they might fall through and like that's okay like be kind to them. Yeah. Be understanding and if they're really pissed about something like I do is with my family too and like they probably need a little extra love. Yeah. Yeah and just let them be angry, you know exiled them a little extra love when they're feeling really intense emotions because even though that's when you want to love them the least until they needed the most definitely, you know, yeah like the other day. My mom was in a really really bad mood yelling at me for no reason and I instead of being like upset. I was just like I just walked up to her and gave her a hug and just it was just like how how like and she started crying and I wasn't so she was sad. Yeah, you know and I was just like so like I immediately was like, okay. She probably needs a little extra love definitely. These kids came into my work the other day and they said some sick shit. They were like, oh when I was a kid, I used to feed alka-seltzers to seagulls. So they would blow up what the heck and I literally like my heart actually started in my chest. I feel so sick and I just said dude. Can you come across the counter? I'm going to give you a hug because apparently your parents never Hugged you you don't just do that if you got hugs, so I came around the counter and I gave him a big hug. We said I'm a pretty messed-up guy that said you should go to therapy. You said, you know what? I'm considering it and then we talked about therapy. That's another thing and that see that is not the response. He was looking for he was looking for me to be like had a heavy that Titans of the bird. Hey Emma. No I said I said yo your parents didn't hug you. Yeah, that's it. That's an animal. You know what I mean? Like could have been like what kind of sick fuck are you would yeah, sick fuck regardless.

That's where I keep things that have been open just as a general rule. So those are just some ideas.	1.0
So today we're going to talk about a subject the subject of kindness we I know that you know as teachers we are hopefully modeling kindness and our classroom kindness on the playground kindless with our peers kindness with their peers because the students the students are looking at you they're noticing you they're watching you and so I was reading an article the other day and found not an unsurprising but it's still a little bit of alarming statistics about what teachers are seeing in their classroom teachers are reporting about a 30% increase in bullying or unkind Behavior being displayed over the last couple of years. It's not surprising but it's still alarming. I think it's not surprising because we are seeing more bullying type of behavior or unkind Behavior through different types of social media channels the way people interact with each other and so students are noticing children are noticing what they're seeing and it's coming back into our classroom. So I thought today would be a great time to talk about kind. This how we how do we Foster kindness in her classroom? And Adam is first of all, one of the kindest people. I know I'm not just saying that because he's staring at me like I totally feel that way and if you've met him before I know that you agree, but he also does some really specific things in his classroom to help Foster that kindness and so I thought maybe Adam you could speak to that.	1.0
Well the sir. Bicoastal, so I started at Burma gooey and I end it at Eden. So the distance from biggity-boom Acuity or even is around 45 minute drive. I have gone further up the coast path / McGeary to town called narooma and down many which is kind of a little bit further than that 45 minutes, but that's probably the proximity because any further and removalist costs as you would know increase so I try and keep A bit in that Circle.

I got I'm gonna go your 2005 Go Juelz Santana with a little boy fresh. That was a high joint officer what the games and missing albums. I think it was a debut album to 2005 with a hot-ass joint man. You just basically telling a story of that movie. If you haven't seen the movie fresh. He basically he basically told the story of that that movie and he was kind of like, you know, just just put You end up aspect is through the kids, you know what he was dealing with, you know, the little boy anybody seen the movie fresh. You know what I'm talking about. If you haven't just just check that shit out man. It was actually was a good movie Man little think he was probably the time maybe like 13 years old or something like that selling dope and also stuff and its sister was hooked on dope with the dude. He was selling dope for and he was Finding ways to scheme and get him locked up to get his sister away from it wasn't doing a lot of shit man. But you know, it was it was it was it was a good movie though. You like those types of movies man, you check that shit out and that's basically storytelling in that in that song and that sample was hot too.	1.0

I haven't heard his name, but I'm assuming he's gone by this point. So Garrett Bradbury would be fantastic selection at 30 or 40 for same thing with The other Center I can't members name. I'm blanking on the guy. However, Chris Lynch from he's not Center in Turkey alignment. Sorry Crystal incident from Boston College both.	1.0
Well, so are the way our schedule works is, you know, obviously if Some of the NFR then we don't do anything until the end of March as far as rodeos are concerned. I don't go to Texas or anything like that. I just use a stay home and Buchholz and do that kind of thing for how my program works is I will I turn to start out March 1st. I leave I leave our studs out for 45 days to 60 days depending on you know, how the weather you know, like I If there's like a feel like they've got two good Cycles. in then then that's when I pull them if if I don't feel like that then in I just I anyway I just want to make sure that I get them covered and I try and do it within two months if I miss if the stud Miss isn't there, I just absorb it and I don't worry about it because I don't need Colts too late because again, it could screw your deal, but I messed up my schedule because I booked the mirrors that I breed and and how I do it is so A good example is like wild and blue and tnf are just a couple of months ago or three months ago, whatever it's been now and she had a cult couple days ago some so she you know, so the turnaround time is so she's bucking the pmf are you know, eight and a half nine months bread. But then she'll she you know has these this winter off. She has her Colton case. I live in California. It's pretty nice where we live it's cold right now, but for the most part it's not too bad in the winters. She'll have she'll have, you know have her cult usually and February or 1st of March and then I will only leave the Colts with the mayor's from Fort same deal as the as the breeding cycle 45 to 60 days and then I and I ween them called too young and I A month as much hay as they'd like as much like they have free choice Alfalfa and then I feed them grain and cast Mana to get them going and and it does two things. It gets my mayor back on the road so I can get a rodeo on again. But it also makes you cold it's good to be around and pretty gentle. So, you know, they come they come to feed and and and they get used to being around people. So they're not they're not real wild went for later on and and then they don't get a little go ahead you obviously they get free choice Alfalfa and good feed but you don't have a problem with them growing just like from not being with her mom. Actually we've done it we've done a test because you've had I've had that question happen a lot and I've actually had the cult that Our on on hey and calf man and grain outperform the Colts that are on the mayor still I'll be done. Yeah, and and I think that's because we don't know how much milka mares producing you think, you know, but you don't know how much the calls getting and and so, you know, it's no different than the cow-calf deal the cow-calf guys, you know, you'll have Pals that always bring in a calf at a great wing and wait and then you got not count bring in a calf with a very good weaning weight. So you just can the cow or whatever they do and get a different cow. Well, it's not that way in the Bucking Horse World where you don't just because America doesn't produce good milk. That doesn't mean we don't want to keep raising cold side where we just going to find a different way to take care of that baby and get big and strong because you know, the maternal ability might not be there on that matter, but the Bucks in them, right? So we got to kind of and going back to what we were talking about earlier this Rocking horse deal isn't like the Bulls deal. You know, it's it's a lot harder. I mean that they just they're so there to get a really shiny bucking horse. It takes a lot of lot of breeding and and a lot of luck and a lot of work. We're in the bull deal. I don't I don't want to discredit the bull deal because it's and say that it's easy. I don't mean it like that because it's hard as well because you only get like half your cash crop, but at the same time You can go and and you know breed Mudslinger to a Houdini daughter and you're gonna have a pretty good chance of a cast that box. I mean pretty good chance, you know, sorry.	-1.0

Jillian is in though. She's not putting a dollar figure on it quite yet. Here's James. I think you're excellent. And you're in a right progression in your career. One weakness. I see with you is that you haven't sold a business nor has anyone on your team. So it's very important almost as important as the other skills combined and so you don't have that and that's that's a significant weakness, but you do I do and so I I would be willing to fill up this bridge by the way. I'm not a venture firm. This is with me with skin in the game. I'd be willing to fill up your round which I think you said this about this about a hundred or hundred fifty left. Yeah, so I'd be willing to fill up that round or what work with Jillian. I'm filling up that round and and and I would require a board seat with some significant voting rights given that I think I would have more experience than anybody who currently have at the moment awesome.	1.0
Yes. Stop grunts. A moral of the story is I would think everybody has some form of anxiety and I think if you were saying no, you're kind of full of baloney because I think any denial Lingus you're doing here in denial is not everywhere in Egypt. Yeah Egypt. Yes. Anyway home and gen Wu I would say yeah, I mean On everybody is affected by it, you know obviously severity is going to change to you're not alone. I think that's the most important thing and three if you need help ask for help, like there are people there that to help you there are there are resources all over the place. I'm sure we could probably pull up a list of yeah, but put a list of resources together. That would be good for no notes who we show notes. We're also going to have some we have some in fact check.

You can do things with him to kind of keep him bucking like like that. You know, if the bareback rider they're not showing you what you need to see you. You still got the bronc riding, you know in the bull rule if the Bulls quit, you know, where do you go from there? You know, that is that's something that maybe some people listening. They may not know a difference to in the horse deal you guys Buck your mayor's as well as your studs and galvan's verses in the bull deal. It's only the Bulls. Well, absolutely. Yeah in fact T' are our best horses are mares. I mean, there's good. I guess I could I don't have numbers in front of me. But I would say the biggest percentage of our heard that's of the higher-end horses are the mayor's you know, and you guys can book them heavy bread too, right? Yes. Absolutely. You know, you don't want to Buck him right up to the end. But but like a good example of For a how our system earlier in the conversation I mentioned how I learned a lot from Ike's Anki and one of the things that I learned from Mike was with breeding young mares and then breeding your business. Let's face it guys. It's if you don't breed your best mares, you're not going to have good Colts. You're gonna have mediocre cult. So you gotta break your best married.	-1.0
Well, I mean you could that mean that's a people trying to construct austrians by Automobiles and so on but I mean this is against just play play but I think a more powerful reason why this keeps up for so long. It's just because it suits the people are in power, but why why does it why does this is that?	-1.0
Instagram and all this is so huge with this generation and people get this little peek into your life. That's all the more reason to be so much more careful what you're doing where you're at and where you guys are together because you know, maybe we see you're at the house together sit on the couch and there's other people around but we don't know and so now we all think you guys just hang out at the house together because that's what's on your Instagram, you know, and so then it leads us to believe we don't know where you draw lines. We don't know where you draw boundaries. And so now you've given off the appearance of evil because you know, we don't know the full backstory and so I would just say to somebody who's dating be so conscious of the fact that first of all you're an example to people that are younger than you your example to people that are around you especially if you're in the church, especially if you're a leader and you're somebody that people look to you know, everything that you display of your life in social media, you know, people are looking at and they're analyzing whether you whether you think they are not they're doing it and they're looking to there. Really looking for you to set a standard. You know, when we when we go when we used to go on trips with our with our work and we were working a secular job people would always come up in make jokes about us, you know, not drinking alcohol and be like, hey you want a drink you want a drink and of course, you know, we don't drink never have and that's not something that we want at all. It's not even a temptation. But you know, there was there's one person in particular that would always be like, hey, you know have a drink have a drink and I think I think back to all those times and I'm like, you know What if we actually would be like, you know what since you've offered it like 25 times sure why not that person would be so disappointed because the thing is people actually like clear set boundaries. They actually want to see you as a Christian live differently than them as the world. And so that's why you find people people that are unsaved they'll see somebody that was like a minister at a bar and then they're like, hey, why is that guy here? You know the unsaved person thinks it's strange that you as a Christian are trying to Gov and be like the world so so it's even more so you should be looking at your life and evaluating. Okay, what are the things that I need to be doing? Especially as a young single person especially as a dating Christian person. I can't look like the dating person that goes on vacation with their with their they're very, you know, their boyfriend or girlfriend. That's not what you do as a dating Christian that's just doesn't work and it's the biggest thing that came across from you when I spoke to	-1.0

Did you guys hate it when you have an amber alert, and it's you Your car I just try to be relatable. No, I meant it was an amber alert that happened to be my car, which is very generic and I like was gonna go somewhere but I was like, maybe on second thought maybe on second. Thought I'll stay home. We'll take an Uber. You gotta start thinking about these things with a beard. You know, I'm done.	-1.0
yeah and weeks we've said it when you record three podcasts and week, I guess you can send a repeat yourselves, but it's I think you trade them now or you don't trade him at all and What makes this tricky is that you probably have definitely have multiple contingency plans. But you have to act on it that this offseason is certainly moving more quickly than the last few have and like if your end if you end up keeping Lindor, well, okay, then you got to go find your second baseman. You got to see if you can add to the Outfield. You got to see if there's a starting pitcher you want to move to get some offense if help do you need to supplement the bullpen if you trade Lindor Maybe He says you get back influence how you do part 2 if you don't trade Lindor you obviously have a plan for part two, but like at what point do you just move on and do decide? Okay talks are done. We're keeping them and we're going to go set our sights on all these other things we have to do and maybe once you start doing all those things it complicates the Lindor talks if the Dodgers end up getting desperate in mid-January and her like we got to do this we've missed out on too many guys.	1.0
So and maybe you can wrap like a band. Down around your face so that you don't worry about something splashing up. Maybe you can wear gloves, you know, I don't really need necessarily need to do those things when I'm cleaning my own toilet, but it's just an idea but the more often you clean it, it won't be as gross of a job. Especially if people are just kind of using that toilet brush as needed and then I keep it soaking in a solution in a cleaning solution, you know in that holder so, you know, just whatever cleaning It usually kind of pour some in that holder and that makes your bathroom smell nice and keeps your toilet brush disinfected.	0.0

We know, you know that kind of thing, but it's so interesting and like confusing because like during season 4 like sterics were not like we were not here for I didn't even watch these in for I watched literally the finale and only the finale because I got information that there's going to be a big steric moment in it. And I was told like there could be a hug or a kiss which there wasn't a hug or a kiss but it was a big steric moment and it was like, why is the show actively trying to like kill steric but then have a moment like that where you have Derek dying and so many different like the he was going back to Styles over and over and over again. Like she'll why is that in the show like who put that in there if you guys hated so much which I have wooden table fan.	-1.0
Yeah, they make sense for the Angels. Love that pairing makes as much sense for the Indians. I think the Angels would probably have to overpay just based on. Their system. It's such a weird. It's a weird thing anyway, because as we've talked about so many times like Obviously kluber does not have Peak trade value right now, you know, you're better off waiting six months or taking a time machine to go back a year or a year and a half. So you're asking a team to take on the contract and I know we've said like the contract is fine. As long as he turns out to be even an adequate picture but no one knows what he's going to be and so it's like you somehow still have to convince a team to give you a really useful piece. Otherwise, it makes more sense to just hold them. And the angels are weird team because they're so top-heavy and their farm system is a lot better than it was a few years ago. When it looks like Mike Trout was just gonna waste away like Tom Hanks in Castaway with Albert Pujols as Wilson, but it's I just made a movie reference like we hate document this podcast, but I think my name is void dumbass. That's that's a good reference. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what they eventually do with him because Because I think it's it's difficult to find if you're going to trade him. Now, then you some team is has to get desperate and I almost think the opposite of the Clevenger thing think of me more sense if the Dodgers liked kluber and believed in him just param with Linda or and see if that'll make a difference.	1.0

I don't even like the video it was dumb. It was video called why I left Christianity and it was actually a response video to a different video that I had made where I had said like, you know, I was silenced in church and like I wasn't allowed Odd to ask questions and like all this stuff and people were like, you know commenting on that and so I did a response video basically clarifying saying I was allowed to ask questions, but I could only ask them once and then once I asked them and got the Christian answer it was like that's your answer like accept it and if it wasn't good enough for me. It was like why are you like beating a dead horse? Why are you still so like, you know, you're just trying to like, you know, put your Deceitful Wicked heart into scripture because you want you know it to be the way you want it to be in like all this stuff and it was just such a misinterpretation of me. Just trying to like learn more and do research and it was like if you keep talking like that you're going to talk yourself right out of this face like you don't sound like a Christian to me and it was just kind of a lot of kind of it wasn't even a very accurate title now that I'm thinking about it because I truly clarified and said I left because I didn't think If the facts were there but in the midst of me doing all this research and and kind of getting all these questions brought to the surface. I was a bit frustrated that I was like borderline not even a Christian at this point and yet you know people I knew who wanted to go into Ministry who were dedicating their life to this Faith didn't even care enough to know the deeper side of their belief system. Like they just had no interest in looking deeper and study. Harder in in answering my questions and like I understood that everyone has their own life and you know, they can't just put it on pause to then, you know study all this stuff with me, but it did frustrate me that the church in itself did a poor job of preparing Christians for the tough questions. Like if there's an atheist who knows apologetics better than Christians, that's that's not good. Good, you know I don't know I feel like that video was like misinterpreted through the YouTube space is crazy.	-1.0

And sometimes I think the more wife doesn't like my running and then every so often she says something like that like just pull your finger out and do the work so Yes, I was actually very good with motivational and although I didn't have a very good not last thought I did run you stay and I'll probably run tonight with how I feel right now.

So that's why it's a Larger dose for that because people always worry about what's going to be too much of a loading dose.

You know, what's interesting is like I didn't feel I felt sad for him because so let me take you through the so so that happened at 12:00 right when I'm 21 reconnected with my father and that's when I came into my sister's life. Then that dissipated now. I mean I've been in my sister's life ever since then but I'm saying him and I was relationship. I'm 25. I try to do it again doesn't work. Then when I was about to turn 30 at a long conversation with one of my aunts that inspired me to try to rekindle that didn't work and so through my life up to you know, when he passed away. I had tried to open this door, but through that experience. I learned that you know Every relationship has to be a dialogue and can't be a monologue. And for some reason when certain, you know, we would talk about certain things and when certain things would come about he would certain Poise a conversation will come about he would just close off he would just close off and so, you know, I told them, you know, I told them I forgave him. I told him, you know, it's all love and you know, I gave him those things and you know, I would tell him I'm saying, you know, they must be if we're both still here God must have a purpose for us to build something, you know, so so when he passed, you know, and I'm saying this just to be honest with you and I'd say this with no I'm not trying to be it was like hearing that someone passed, you know outside like when I leave here, you know, it was like a stranger because I didn't know and For me, I just felt more sad for him because it didn't have to be that way, you know, and he had other kids. He had one other son who he was in and out of his life. So but I was the first one I was the oldest and there was a point that like I did so let me tell you this other part like with my sister. I I got to a point where I was like I was willing to have been the guinea pig like I get it I was your first kid is all new to you volleyball. But when I saw that he repeated that pattern with my sister, that's when I lost a bit of respect. I come on like I would have much rather. That's when I had expectation.

Hello and welcome back to the talk unit walls podcast. We're here for podcast number 12, and we are here to review obviously the games that happen in November alongside. Cheers time talking to the my queen. Hey, I'm checking on fine. I'm fine could barely a levels. Are we going to be reviewing the games from November? And of course we could actually be talking about a team of the decade as well. But as always, my name is Dave a long. So I've been here is Tom y'all got the black Tom? How's it going?	1.0
Okay. I see I knew her before that but like still like the thing that I knew her from was like A Walk to Remember which is Nicholas Sparks movie that I probably should have known at the time. So yeah, I agree with you on that. I don't think that she was the person to compare people to okay my neck.	-1.0
It has given me everything. I know like I'm just so thankful. I stayed in it for so long because he gave me the technique it showed me how to connect my body properly because everything is done from your Center in Ballroom. All the strength comes from your legs and your Center and hopefully it resonates through your face and through your upper body, you know, so it gave me definitely that strength and connections inside my body. So when I do something that's outside Ballroom, I still feel like I'm able to be connected and look kind of okay fish but it definitely gave me discipline. So on it's good to plan and my body and going through pain, you know and and discomfort and sometimes when you feel like wow, I feel so good today and you look at the video like what is that bad and then like some competitions I walk off the floor and I'm like how like that was. The worst dancing I've ever done in my life and we watched the video with her coach and she's like this is probably one of your best competitions ever, huh? So it always taught me like don't trust your like the interview boy.	1.0
Yeah there I was looking at it the Gold Cup also America's going into first. I believe that the western hemispheres. Version of lie. It's like the world conflict though like North America and South America only and I believe I don't know but it had you not it's going to be United States vs. Mexico. So if you guys want to watch the guys play for that one, you can watch that it's like later tomorrow. But yeah, so we have those two sports going on cup is north and Central America and the Caribbean region. So yeah, there you go guys besides that that's all for sports. And I think we're going to end this podcast with a quote. I like to add. I'm going to leave a quote for this time and then we can have like Rick your debut one for next time. So today's quote that I would love to leave you all with would be so the quote that I live by and I it's really believable. So we'll give an example after I say the quote. Once you stop wanting something it usually happens. So like we were at Taco Bell and KFC today and Dave and Rick. He's been looking for jobs, right but they didn't go up and ask. Are you guys hiring instead? We got our food we were hanging out, you know acting a little dumb because you know, that's what guys do when they're with other guys. We really love doing but we weren't doing like we weren't doing really like it wasn't bad like we it was considerable to just like really separate. The out here who writes on the table on accident. Okay.	1.0
Yeah, something about airplanes in the Indians getting stuff done. It was a few years ago trying to hammer out a contract with Santana last year actually acquiring Santana back this year. It could have been blind or but the six exclamation points were only matched or the six question marks. You sent me were only matched by the 600 was that you receive back in your text with the quote-unquote Rival executive.	1.0
Please probably about 500 upstairs and downstairs and all these, you know, the reputation of racist chant in and just been Ultras and stuff like that and have come out with these chance and then they followed with yeah.	-1.0
Okay? Yeah, it was hurtful.	1.0
How do you finish tracks? The best way to finish tracks is to have a purpose. the reason a really good reason to finish them in the first place. Are you wanting to finish a track? for a labor that you actually don't even like or do you want to finish a track? Because you just feel inspired at this moment.	1.0
Hello did oh, no, did I just bought a boat?	0.0
You know, thank you Tim. Is there anything we're kind of near the end here anything you want to add?	1.0
However, Miley's acting sucks in the entire first season. It's so cheesy and uncomfortable, and I'm not If it's just because of the writing but it none of it seems like genuine. Yeah, I agree Lily is also sometimes a little but also like I wrote in my next note is like I can't believe how young they are like, they're supposed to be you said just before high school.	-1.0
On average, I guess about a hundred and thirty so usually between the hundred in it or a hundred and a hundred and seventeen days a week. Yeah.	0.0
Stone so we just got the lease for a year.	0.0
He's all right.	1.0
Like I always tell people, you know, when you hold that syringe back up, you can see the are in just slowly push the plunger of the syringe up until that are is gone. You don't need to see in the movie spurting out of the syringe because we're not wasting our naloxone, you know, just until that are is out and if there is still Mariner totally fine. It's not gonna do anything to you. It's like said it's not like the movies.	0.0
All right. So yeah, you go to our now.	1.0
He was always like like playing and doing his thing but nappytabs were just so cool to work with they were very positive always positive made sure that you got if you didn't get it, they would always explain them. Like just just the most amazing people so cool to work with them.	1.0
I know you're right. But I think the project management side of things does help me because it makes you be very organized and structured in how you complete projects.	1.0
Oh, so you made the decision to not pursue, you know music not in the same way that you pursued, you know acting but how many times have you kind of rethought that decision? Not that you couldn't be an actor too, but you you literally could have done both, you know what I mean, you know.	-1.0
Yeah, and I mean I see I've just just personally that's what my father-in-law's who is this is a working class person. So it's just been work out all of his life and he has been able to in France in the 1970s. He is called a how's it going with his family to application? I mean they've been always very disciplined and so on but he could afford all these things could send their children to school could send them to diverse universe. He was paying for all of this. I mean how many Working Class People can do this today? It's just I mean you to be top notch in your activity extremely well paid is a working class object group occupation order to do this. So most people cannot and he was kind of average at the time. So I think if you look at these things even on an anecdotal basis and see what's what are the living conditions real terms. I would how did people live what did they consume? What kind of food they bring on the table? Where did they travel and so on in light of this? I mean clearly they are many signs of impoverishment and on top of this comes of course, I mean we have both right. I think we have Capital destruction. So there is an aggregate impoverishment at the same time. We have this redistribution. So they're out of the fewer resources in comparison to whatever 20 30 years ago. It's a greater chant goes to their people are very well connected and So the other classes and that is of course, that's that's explosive for society.	-1.0
And the particular person what works for how you know how I learn is different from maybe how you learn, you know, maybe a classroom setting works better for me. I'm not sure if that's true. But like maybe it does it just depends like and I think again, this is a conversation. I think we could probably do a whole episode on I think Film School versus not filming. We should I think we should too like I found it helpful for me for the most part, but what I didn't learn I learned a lot about story if anything the four years was worth the screenwriting class that I took an incredible teacher named Paul Larsen. And who the guy just the best thing about him? He taught me the one rule of screenwriting like screenwriting doesn't really have rules. There's one rule and of keep it interesting. Yeah, whatever it takes to make that happen. Well, we've that we've made not to jump ahead but we've made three short films together and I think that shows right? Yeah, I think so. I think that's it everything. I feel like I should have like tattooed on my butt or on your butt or is that you know what I mean, like like or on like a written on a wall would probably make a lot more sense or just an arm or just two dozen armed. Yeah or tattooed on my eyeball. It just like I think it's probably the best piece of writing advice I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of writing advice everybody has writing advice but if keep it interesting if you remember that and you look what you're doing, like is this interesting and even if it's just interesting to you, you know, that's that's a start as long as it's interesting in some way shape or form that was kind of the past.	1.0
Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about in terms of undesired consequences. The thing that we have to realize about a show is that you have the showrunner you have the writers, but then you also have the director and you have the editors specifically the editors. Those are going to be the ones are like, oh this shot and then he's going to look at him. They don't like him, you know, and they do kind of work in tandem, but each one. Those people have their own motive and I think what we caught in was this person's like who's Derek? I'm gonna you know, they're not going to do on the show. I'm going to slip this in for the fans ha ha ha and then you have the people like, oh well slip in a little steric and kind of string along the fans and then you have someone's like no staring and so it's just this mishmash of all these different motives and it makes it entirely confusing because you also have to remember that by season for we're dealing with Shelly. They either made a huge mistake or someone was really exposing but there was a storyboard release of their ideas. It was like an outline for season 3 be specifically for 320 and on that board. It said Styles mom, but it did and it was like in small letter. So something that you could tell that they weren't really expecting people to pick up but specifically there was no mention of Malia no mention of Shelley nothing. And so it's like you give Holland talks about used to talk about getting the scripts the same day and I'm like you have a period of time that is specifically for writing. Yeah, what is happening that you're giving scripts the same day of shooting what's going on in here? What's this mishmash?	-1.0
It was actually a when we were down in Vegas. I noticed every security guard. It wasn't just a police every security guy have a tourniquet on there on the belt and most actually had some of them even had like a like a like big. Well, I'll a mishandle my fact like bang it's pretty good to see and I know they haven't had a pretty big incident on there. So they're probably a little more on edge and many of us but there's good to see even just security had the Rudy I could see the see the orange cap on them.	1.0
Thanks so much for answering that cuz I was sweating a little bit to ask you that I thought was this is this disrespectful but really I mean in this day and age you see, you know amputees without a leg they come back from combat or whatever and then the technology is so good. You almost don't even notice a gate in their walk and they can run competing all these things. But yeah, it makes so much sense. There's so much more going on with the hand. It's going to take a lot longer for that technology to get to the same. Level Paul, do you still dive a lot? And if you do, what was it like At first time going back in the water?	1.0
Ricky to come out with would you rather and like it be something about dying this way and he like get really specific it would be like a four page essay on how like one thing and like or and it'll be like, okay. Ricky didn't have to be that specific. I know Thomas. I'm just making sure there's no loophole and this is all you hear is me get one local around like well you oh my god rather.	-1.0
That the why would they do that?	-1.0
All right, you don't think to see houses attractive. How about now Neil Patrick Harris? He's unbelievable. Thank you. He's a quadruple threat.	-1.0

So after you got the final point to win the championship, how did that feel	0.0
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and in this podcast. I'm going to let you give a shout out to whoever you want to give a shout-out to like whether your team your mom your dad the floors are yours cutter shout out to my parents and shout out to my sister and the cheerleaders. All right there you guys have it man cutter Martin from the Han Le pied Piper's. Thank you so much for being on Patriot port stock from Texas, sir.	1.0

Even you not from gentrify Brooklyn or from like from the pre gentrification Brooklyn, right?	-1.0
The relationship well, was it open about our story is so for the first two years of us knowing each other. We were just friends platonic like we would just I was the homie and then we started dating, you know, we kind of dating but then like after about a few months like six months ironically enough. I was the one that was like we probably shouldn't date. And she was like, wow, I was like yo you about to do your thing. I'm about to do my thing. I really love our friendship and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that and I don't want to like you're supposed to you were young like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't want to resent you. I don't want you to resent me and so we kind of went back to friends and then a few years after that we kind of just Kind of grew apart, you know a little bit I moved out here to LA and and then one night. I'm in the club and I'm going to the bathroom and this girl is like oh, you know my homegirl Keisha and I'm like Keisha's fight me and she was like, yeah. I'm like call her. And she called her and we got on the phone and she can tell Amy left.	1.0
I asked him about it because Viktor Frankl, it's great.	1.0
The gun is in my mouth their bedroom, but they definitely have to they're asked to clean the rooms every day. And they do an okay job of it. But the not bloody pads, so I ruined the kitchen the food on the floor just in general just like oh, what was this? Oh used to be like a is this a grape if I can't have no rights like AB.	-1.0
What Hall they got ya can't both things be true. Yeah. That was all there was a little bit true in the bower aspect. It's like, oh man. Well, you lost the front of the rotation arm that you would have had next year. But look at everything you got so have the Indians won every single trade. I don't know. Did they win the trade? Did they win the trade when they In his dribble Cabrera to the Nationals for Zach Walters.	1.0
I will say the fact that you said that because I know for a while like I think you still have a post in the archives.	0.0
Oh, yeah, he went to the end of our here. He is right here on the list.	1.0
Find the point when the bubble actually burst because we get we it's been blowing bigger and bigger and bigger and people might say well look it's working. Right the stock market is up. It was that we had a crisis in 2007 2008. The market is up interest rates are low, but they're still you know, this there's some very small move down you could make I'd argue that they were at a point where they're meaningless, but but it seems to have inverted. Cam has worked how much longer can this work for before it all goes wrong in your view. Is there can we look at history to find a way to predict how close we are to the end of this?	-1.0
Which one they match today one. Did you he's very well spoken very eloquently put together.	1.0
It's a great thing. We knew it all along.	1.0
So you're forced to keep running around.	-1.0
Well, I wish when he loved down and out when he found it out ahead of time. I'm he should have tried to put a stop to it. I do want to say something about the trade machine though. I mean it's it is interesting. So Paul horns was was asking Chris Hansen Eddie about kind of the mechanics of Trades and how they decide what a player's value is and God bless onesie because that's not something you can answer simply in a 30-second reply or but you know the teams they basically assigned a dollar value to every player in every system and it's You know, you're not trying to match up. You're just trying to get an idea for what a player is worth might be over the Long Haul and the thing is is Linus has woken up from a slumber. The thing is like when you're trying to find a match for an Indian's Dodgers trade. It's not going to be even the team that's taking on the younger less proven players is the team that needs to have that higher number because there's more risk involved, you know, so you're not trying to trade Lindor if he's valued at 80 million and you're not trying to trade him for 80 million dollars of surplus of value of prospects. You got to get more back. And so that's that's I think that's one error.	1.0
Here's her story.	0.0
Distant horses tend to outperform their mothers in the arena. I would word of it out.	1.0
I remember when he first signed me my maker speaker Mike Lewis and he was like Eno player. He's awful. We wouldn't say he's going to be real we wouldn't be where we are today without bond. It was like it was awful my offer.	-1.0
Oh, it's probably only like like five or six okay a day just kidding, but it's like when you take these shots, it's like I really want to make sure I'm feeling really good about myself. So it's like I am like perfectly shaved. I'm spray-tanned. I'm like contoured to the max in the face and that's What makes me feel really good. It's like I feel completely gorgeous in these photos interesting. I don't really know how to Contour my face. So like that's not what my also like.	1.0
I also Find out till the day I die bunch of Pilots running around. I mean, I feel like they need to just have a generic looking person or you can choose your Legend. You just don't get the abilities because I just imagine everybody choosing Bangalore everybody choosing wraith or everybody choosing octane for that matter. Yeah, because having that, you know regenerating health or whatever would be really nice. And so I feel like that'd be the only well I guess without the abilities you wouldn't have the great generated. Never mind.	1.0
All right. Thanks. See you.	1.0
No did not get the bends it really depends on how long you've been under and how deep he's gone. And the gas you breathing on it can all change depending on if you're breathing on oxygen or nitrogen or helium. The different depths. You have to stop at the different periods of time. You have to stop at and I remember the first time that I did it will do her in still in training and we were doing Bounce dive, so just basically down and up on a helmet to about 60 meters about a hundred eighty feet through sixes open. Yeah hundred eighty eight and my we always dive with bodies when possible because it's a dangerous business and it's nice to have someone there to back you up, but my body couldn't clear his is and so I had to go down by myself. And this is just outside the heads of Sydney Harbour and this is a great white shark highway is tiger sharks as bullshit. And so I have to sit at my what we call a wet. Stop a decompression stop at about 15 meters for 10 minutes. And I feel like the smallest most indefensible worm on a hook. I've who's so exposed in the middle of the ocean.	-1.0
That's totally intuitive. And and again, it's like you didn't even mentally understand why you were craving watermelon at the time but there's this inherent wisdom that your body has to know what it needs especially in a in a situation where there's something out of balance. So, you know, it's ironic because diet culture the system are like the system that exists that really promotes dieting as the way to health really demonizes cravings and tells us that our Cravings are something to it. Nor or that, you know, we need to fight or overcome our Cravings but in your case layout like you're craving was telling you the exact thing that you really needed and that was going to really benefit your body. So you listening to that and you giving your body what it needed was the best thing you could do for yourself at that time and probably had a really positive impact on your blood circulation at the time.	1.0
I think it comes down to being on a team and I think learning from each other which is what this podcast is all about learning from each other and helping teach others. I want to I want to leave it on a piece of advice from you Aaron. Do you have one piece of advice that kind of follows what we've been talking?	0.0
The beginning of the season has a lot of formalities which need to take place including meeting with the families of your team and setting expectations establishing team rules ordering uniforms Mr. On the bright side. You actually get to start practice which is why you are drawn to coaching in the first place right meeting the parents meeting. The parents can be an intimidating situation unless you are from a small town where everyone knows Is everyone you'll be going into this meeting with no idea what personalities you'll encounter from. The get-go. Everyone will be extremely friendly. Most of them will be just as excited. As you are about the upcoming season will be eager to hear your plans for the team. However, this doesn't mean you can go into the meeting totally relaxed. And without preparation families will have questions for you. And the ones who will ask you questions are the ones who are not concerned with sugar coating their enquiries. This is why you try to address many of these Topics in a welcome speech / presentation. So you give off the vibe of being prepared and that you are fully capable of leading their daughters. Here are some examples of the questions. You might be asked at your first meeting of the year.	1.0
Yeah, that'll definitely fix it for you. So, I mean we definitely Definitely stretch this out to a good-sized episode. Now. I feel like you know, there's we had a really good conversation. I definitely like to have you on again if you're able to yeah, and I'll definitely look into better gear not crackling too much. Oh, no, you sound absolutely fine. So everybody thank you guys for joining us for this episode of the hop-up cast. Thank you Tina.	1.0

Yeah. It's grossly creamier.	-1.0
I think we ask God for so many things that sound like good ideas, but then we have the opportunity to practice those things. A lot of us are like, oh heck no like not right now next time right?

I don't have anything else with his handprint on it from that time and it is is broken and I'm like, oh my gosh, and of course, I turned to my husband and I'm like, why did you not put these ornaments? Hopefully, I like totally blanked him right for these ornaments and he's like if like really like you should have put you should have put it away. Like if it was that important to you, right and oh my God, let me tell you girl like I'm a Christian. But I like the south side of the Kingdom came out at me. I got so upset and I got a little hood on him.	1.0

I mean usually you'd be helpful in its environment. I mean I've seen pictures of you you are a physical specimen and you felt completely powerless. I mean, that's one hell of a show.	-1.0
Well, that's just it's all public education. Right? I mean, there's so many opinions with it like you got a lot of harsh opinions and well, why are you helping some of these overdosed, you know like but like I said like with when somebody approaches me, I just tell them they look like I've literally my career I've had to resuscitate like 14 year olds from Man overdosed in the past and it wasn't intentional like they're not a drug user.

It's allowing yourself to be where you are. Right? No matter what it may be what you may be feeling and checking in with yourself is a really hard being. It's you really got to be true and honest with yourself to be able to do this in verses like, you know, comparing yourself to whether it be something you're seeing on social media or what you think that you should be doing or what your friend is doing for this like I feel like I should like green juice and I just effing done. Okay, like I Lee don't like kale drinks, okay or smoothie bowls for that. Yeah. I really what I prefer and I've learned this through my body. I don't love like yogurt-based smoothie or a milk-based like I like when I drink something healthy, I'm doing air quotes here. I want like this tart juice of like beets lemon grapefruit Ginger like that type and I could probably a Beretta she's a pizza from are you Dating love that that's all other episode we should do but those things I know right because of and I try to force myself because smoothie bowls are so all the fad and like they look so pretty with the acai color and the Granola and the things that on my Instagram feed, but you know what it's like what if I told you that you never had to drink a kale juice if you didn't want to or like right you like nobody is forcing you to drink the Milky smoothie Kool-Aid you don't have to do it.	1.0

We're like my dad gamble. So now we're living in the trailer now, it's nice. But like when I hit like fucking freshman year and I went swimming or like eighth grade.

So the trail is very narrow and I'm in terms of like you've got those are grass trees. They used to call them black boys or not. Yes. Yeah, they're everywhere. And so you've got to hold your arms. Out in front of you very Rocky Trail and yet James changing direction constantly and then it's and then lots of ups and downs like so your one minute you'll be okay. So you can never get a consistent gate not even close and if you look on my almost rather, I went from running five and a half minute Kay's to nine-minute gaze to 11 minutes rise. And and so I was really it was hard to and I That was the point where I was like, okay, I need to put it is a slow down here for it. Yeah, you're pushing a little bit too hard too early. There's a couple of real steep lung busting climbs there. They're only so you're going up like 40% gradient, but it's only for probably 20 or 30 meters but there's lots of little climbs like that. So and then it's all those hands and knees kind of stuff, you know, like and then and and it's very easy to get lost in that section and I know for a fact A fact that a lot of people did get lost taking because this is Trails going off in every conceivable Direction into the scrub and it's beautiful, but I don't know it can it's a little bit too moralizing and that section goes on for maybe 4 or 5 kilometers. I get so does seem to go on then you're going through paddocks and then you go on to more Road and then so about kilometer 30 you hit the road or 31 and then it's about On ches to the next aid station, so to a checkpoint two and that's where my first drop bag was. So I got there feeling not fantastic but not terrible. Like I was all right, and I remember coming through there in about three and a half hours, which was I was happy with the time that I was there even though I just so I slow it up a little bit but I was still passing other because it was a group of people that started at six o'clock. So the slower waves started at 6 a.m. M and the faster wave started at 7:00 a.m. So at that point I caught a few of the six o'clock wave people wouldn't always say hello on the way through I saw at all that shout out to Dion who is one of the ladies I used to coach who completed High School 105 last year and she is an absolute Legend and I coach to through that last year and she gave me a big hug at checkpoint 2, which is really just You know that kind of just really lifted my spirits. So yeah, so checkpoint to grab my bag. I drop bag and stuffed in lots of food because the next section from checkpoint 2 to 3 is what I call the death zone. So it's basically it's the hardest section for multiple reasons. It's 22 kilometers between Aid stations. It's got more really technical climbing. And it's the most exposed section of the course as well. So we went through that and I thought okay if I can get through this next 22 kilometers in about 3 hours. I'll be happy. So so now going through going into what is called a just after the Aid Station you go into you'll T Conservation Park, which I always say it's like deja vu it feels the trails feel exactly like the previous. I should Park really Rocky and twisty and up and down and just like impossible to get a rhythm going and that goes for about a kilometer 30 37 or 38. Maybe maybe 36 2 plus 1 3 or 4 kilometers. I pulled out some pretty slow kilometers through that but I'd used I was feeling a bit negative in that point and I thought this is where I need to just back. Back off a little take the pressure off myself and just to get acknowledged that it's going to be slow. No matter what I do. And so I slowed down eight and I thought when I get out on the runnable sections, I'm going to run and and that's what I did. And by the time you get out to about a kilometer 40 you are certain you can sort of run a bit more you're running through these paddocks though with a grass is so long. Like I'm talking up around my past my waist. You're going through these Farms. Yeah. And it's it really likes get really itchy. You can't say yeah, you can't see the ground and sea running and you don't know whether you stepping in a hole or anything because it's where the cows have been. It's really uneven. So that's technical in a different way, you know like and so I but I managed to get through there without twisting my ankle too badly and I got to about kilometer 45 and I'm coming up on this road and I saw lots of cars coming around this country road and then I remembered that the race has changed this year and they now have a 60 kilometer and 37 and I was coming up on the very start of the 60 kilometer race literally as they were about to start and so perfect. I came in at the back and I was about 50 meters from the start line and heard the three two one and then they all started running and so for the next few case, I had people to run with which is fantastic, you know. It will lift and I think made the rice so much better having a having it finished that way and you run across the hindmarsh tears, which is sort of you this exposed and the road it's kind of endless paddocks and I'd say this is yeah. Like I said, it's the Death Zone on the hot days. It's really hard to get through this section. And then I was starting to I was feeling all right, and then I thought I'll smash some gel. Elle's and I've been I've been drinking my infinite fairly like a being a good boy making sure you're staying on top of my nutrition and my hydration and I had and then about you get to about kilometer 53 and you're at the top of this road called. Would Cone Road and it's it's a four kilometer downhill on on bitumen and dirt road all the way down to the aid station. So it's a real relief you get there and it's not too steep that it hurts but steeper. After you can get a nice roll on and I think what did I do? I was managed to get onto a decent pace through their back so might sort of my goal was every time I was on a runnable section was to try and get into the low six minutes per kilometer. And and on this on that section. I got down under six minutes days and just felt sad to feel good again came into the a station feeling great thinking. I've only got a marathon to go now and it got there. In six out and six and a half hours.	1.0

Way, I fully believe that what you do in dating like when you go too far you steal from Marriage from that and so you're stepping over boundaries that when you get into marriage, you're like, they'll be less of an enjoyment. So you have a and that's why you shouldn't date for too long. Like if you're 14, first of all, you shouldn't be dating. I don't think anyone under 18 needs to be dating. The purpose of dating is marriage. It's not to have a friend like the that's the purpose. It's like what is this person right for me? I think honestly, there are some 18 year olds who are like ready to be married. Read and there's different people I wasn't I mean I was 30 when I got married, but if you don't have life figured out, if you don't know what you're called to do, if you don't have a job if you're living at home, if you're not you don't have a course that you're on if you're like still playing video games for a few hours a day. You're not ready to be married. And therefore you should not be dating but choosing the right thing understanding the purpose. It's not companionship. It's not so your Instagram feed can be awesome. People can think you're popular like the purpose of dating is in that's another thing too because because of how	-1.0

But yeah, and they had a really cool Studio great opportunities there with meeting people. People I had people coming in all the time. That was the first time I got to work on like a large set. I work with like Danny Trejo and I got to get my hands on expensive Hollywood equipment. I think, you know the guys I met there that have been there for a long time in the grip house. They did like Dumb and Dumber and Matilda and The Sandlot all these really cool movies and it was just it was fun to like set around the lunch table and listen to these stories from these grips, you know, and totally and awesome. Yeah again mentoring right so I didn't still think in the back of my head. I didn't learn a lot in college, but now I'm still learning right I was able to take the knowledge from that country. And Redman and apply it to forward I was able to apply forward and keep pushing forward. So I walk in and getting one day get this I'm there for maybe eight months and a show canceled from show time that we were doing a lot of work on remember the show was yes blood and oil. So we were we had just invested I say we but the owner had just invested a lot of money into these huge Airy lights like Sky panel not Sky panels the way bigger than that. They're like do their you could like fit inside of them. They're the biggest Lights I've ever seen they create they create like Son basic, right and he bought three of them and I guess the invested all his money into those. They're still doing great right now. Redmond is basically long story short. That was they didn't have money to pay us anymore. So guess what head on the chopping block number to yank?	1.0
Actually. They just got an order for like three more seasons.	0.0
Yeah, that's a great point. And one of the things we've noticed is it's been uh, it's been small single digits over the past in 15 plus years and we're projecting it to climb to almost a third of the construction starts in terms of dollars spent and that's a that is a huge shift in the way in which projects are built and it's In amount of large projects and the challenges they're becoming is proliferation of these large projects and the experience on them is largely bad from a cost standpoint from a schedule standpoint. We are seeing as I mentioned this at the Kirk conference from our point of view and working with contractors. We're seeing lots of what I will call voluntary exits from a space. So contractors that are saying we've gotten into these large projects we've had bad. Experiences we've lost a ton of money in the case of some public companies. We've lost a lot of Share value and we are strategically pivoting out of that market and we are going to go find work elsewhere. Well what other contractors participate in the reproductive and then there are you know, sort of what I've referred to as the involuntary exits is we have seen a lot of in the past 24 months is contractor bankruptcies, even for some of the largest companies in our industry that go belly-up as a result of being involved. These big projects that get sideways and they can they can take down even even a really large contractor.	1.0

It really kind of just Falls along the lines of self-love and sense, right? So my journey started in I will say the 10th grade ninth grade summer around 10th grade. So around that time I had I got coaching Miracles coaching, you know, they work with Law of Attraction but also really heavy on subconscious mind programming like NLP neuro-linguistic programming. So it's basically we do this these deep visualization almost hypnotic exercises that take me to you know, certain memories. It's traumas and just limiting beliefs and things of that. Nature and we cleared it. You're going to notice that all why I've noticed that all these negative emotions. These stuck traumas are all tied to limiting beliefs without limiting beliefs. There will be no trauma and that may be controversial but this is coming from someone who's done the work, right? And this is what I've experienced.	-1.0

Like there are so many positive benefits that we get from moving our bodies and the second you make exercise about either a punishment for something you ate or simply for the pursuit of weight loss. It just takes the fun away and if we just remove that from the equation and treated exercise as a celebration of what your body we can do in a celebration of having the ability to even move your body, which is also just a privilege in and of itself how would shift your relationship to movement like, what would you do differently? You know, I also see people thinking like we live in like the no pain no gain culture right where it's like people think that you need to feel depleted and exhausted and like you can't move after snack Orangetheory. Yeah, right like okay calling them out, but it's true. It's like Who made that rule like why can't exercise be something that energizes me and that I like just enjoy but then I can have enough energy for the rest of my day.

But where I was going with something more specific which is how does retailer 103 benefit from the hundred to retailers that you already have. You've got all this data around these audio. What's that company's name? Jjolbodyo. Jjolbodyo is customers, right, you know the names of the customers, you know, their purchase frequency, you know their usage frequency. And so if you get the third Audio company signing on to sandbox, can we cross marker two different customer bases? Can we say? And across different an economist lie, and and that's where I think it becomes really defensible and really valuable is if we can if we can say to the thousandth customer you benefit from the 999 other customers that already signed on the network effect of the data and the but the ability to provide even our existing retailers with automated information about the data, you know on a recurring basis, huh? But it's Daniels vision of the of the network effect is	1.0

And my wife was like Hey, you know, he's still up my son is still up and he was two years old and I was like I'll get to and she kept nagging me about it, and I thought to myself. At least I'm here, you know and then that thought kept echoing in my head because it of course I love my kids, you know, but I was just like damn where did that come from? You know, what does that mean? Like because obviously I like I love my kids more to love myself, but that's that's what kind of got me on that Journey but it's interesting what you say like with these statistics of now because and I touch on this in my book like when I was growing up, You are eyeball if you knew your father like I only knew two dudes who knew any fathers and we used to look at them like y'all weirdos. Yeah, you know and that's how much we had. We had rationalize that trauma and and I think that's a generational thing too. I think you know when you go back, I mean, we're not gonna go too far back, but let's just say from like Vietnam era right you go back then you got a lot of cats coming back home. They on drugs a lot of cats are going to jail and heroines hitting in then the 80s come around. You know for us it's like my mom always says like my generation is like yo, we did the Civil Rights thing y'all go get the bag. You know what I mean? It's like every generation has another thing so you have a lot of you know, a lot of us people my age would whether you college educated or not, you know the out there not just with jobs, but with some form of a career, you know, and they come from not having that think so. Everyone is like we're trying to reverse that cycle or break the cycle, you know what I mean?	-1.0

But man we've been playing the blame game since the beginning right Adam and Eve they both eat the forbidden fruit and God asked Adam about it. And he's like, well this woman you gave me told me to eat it, right and then he's like, well this serpent told me to eat it, right I mean It is so much easier to blame other people or to play victim really right and knew that victim word is like dang know like none of us want to admit it. But we do and that is just us as humans, right? That's why we have to go to God and a girl. Let me tell you when I was like, I mean I got upset at my husband, but also the Holy Spirit told me like Eva.	-1.0

Storage is an issue. So attending the Symposium recently instead need hearing the storage company get up on stage and talk about how they can offer all these things to stages. Like we just don't have any of that down here and I'm sure in a lot of regional areas don't have that access. So storage is quite expensive down here removalists are expensive. So I've been lucky to find a couple of guys who do Up me, they're not a furniture removal us as such with the truck, but they are very good to me and they do look after my friend nature when we are moving it. But also the biggest challenge that I've found is is actually educating people about what home staging actually is in the area when I first started right at home staging II overheard my dad telling someone what right at home staging was all about and he got it completely wrong, so I had to tell my parents It's like basically gave them a script on what home staging does so and to this day I still find it's an education piece with everybody on home staging and how it can benefit them when they're selling their home, which is a very yeah, I agree and it's it could be quite difficult because you not only selling yourself.	-1.0

Yeah, it does goes from Cape Jervis across the bottom of the floor area up sort of near Victor Harbor, which is nearer we start at y pinga and and then it goes up through the Adelaide Hills generally. Then across right past Mount lofty and right up into like sort of not far from the Clare Valley and and then you end up it finishes in the Flint North and the Flinders ranges like up in the desert. And so obviously we just covered the bit down on the this south of Adelaide and so basically going from wiping out to kaipo Forest for those who are not from here that doesn't really make any sense, but locals know all about About it. And first thing I will say if you're not from here, this is like becoming a really good 100K race. Like I've seen it grow over the time that I've been doing it and Ben Hawkins is the race director and who sort of the founder of ultrarunners essay and he's also a very good friend of mine. He has just he put his heart and soul into these races and he he goes he was so he was a crook as a dog on the day he could barely speak. Because he had and his wife is 38 weeks pregnant and he was there at you know, and he just from from Son Well Before Sunrise and too well to the very last Runner came in, you know, like he just you know, they'd lose race directors work hard and then also that the rest of the team like been pieman, pardon me and and Michelle Hanlon and probably a bunch of names. I'm going to forget plus all the a station volunteers. They all everyone just works really hard. At this race and this year was the best year. So anyway, I took off really fast. I'm running along I get to the first style to step over the thing so and hang on. Hang on.	1.0

Melee, but they made a lot of clones one thing that was brought up. That was like this really kind of salient point from one of my viewers was just that it's the camera secretly that makes the game so much fun. Like it's not it's like it feels like someone's holding it and following you around and that like kind of like that feeling that it's like more lives at helped so much the camera and this game is so good when they switch from cutscenes to like when you're in different environments if it's like rumbly or whatever. It's such a good camera. So smooth always where you need it to be it's never annoying to deal with with and even though there's like a vertical layers to the map. You don't have to like look you don't like look up too hard. Yeah someone it's so it's so well done.

So we're working our way is one layer of yeah, I think the evidence is strong. It's not conclusive. I think this the evidence is strong that has been Capital consumption as compared to 20 or 30 years ago. And then there are other forms of capital Social Capital ball Capital emotional Capital which all cultural Achievements have been a lot of the way are the basis of our current economic and social order. And of course, we are destroying the winning at them as well. And that's where I see the two problems in the long run another. I mean, I'm an economist so professionally, of course, I'm I'm interested in material things as you are as well because you are working in the financial markets, but I'm much more concerned in the long run about the destruction of the moral foundations.	-1.0

I don't listen to the radio radio, but I listened to XM radio and so they have a channel called the message. And so which happens that a lot of the music that they play on the message. We actually played our church so it works out but like I just feel like when It's like almost like I'm praying to feel like just I'm trying to release it when I know that it's like I can feel it in my chest. Like I just sing really loud. Which yeah, it's I don't know. It's a whole article it is like the other day. I was listening to Skillet, which if you don't know who Skillet is there like a heavy metal Christian rock band, which you would never know there were heavy metal Christian rock, but you should listen if you'd have time go listen to Stars which is so good. It's like I was for the day I was driving to the mall before a thing that had to go to I'm just like I'm like, okay. Well, that's a fail because I'm like losing my makeup. You're not gonna do all this again. Yeah, but like, I don't know for me singing just like it's almost like it's like releasing from me to like just at least calm down and it's my way of prey like like an open loudmouth prayer of like, okay. I'm here. I just need some help. Yeah. Well, I realized that that that is helpful. I also understand that having a counselor or a doctor or those also like you have to have all of those components I think you yeah. To really make you feel like you can help help it kind of get under control. That's yeah, at least that's what works for me. I've probably become more spiritual and that respect and like in the last probably two years. It's like I would have never thought to like jump right into that be like, yeah. Okay, that's not that's not like I grew up in a church-going family. But like I haven't really like connected to that until like recently which is kind of cool. But yeah makes me feel better.	1.0

We treated it as more a bony injury. So so we ended up deciding to have we didn't get a scan but we've had Three weeks off running and then we're just gradually trying to introduce a little bit of running now to see how it is. So hoping that is just an early stage bone reaction and and then you can slowly get back into running bit legit like we laugh about it now, but that was quite a frustrating time for you like missing that 5K because luckily sort of reported in one of those earlier podcast like we've had some Ames with your 5K and on the track. It's a really good environment. I meant to do a good 5K time. So it was quite frustrating but I thought like you're dealt with it. Well, how did you feel like you handled it?	-1.0

Sorry that guy he see right away is like are you thinking it's some sort of a OD course, there's three people in the car and none of them were responsive really and one of them may be in the back. Is still someone at the Atlantic and yeah right away. We open the doors. He said I'm putting on masks everything like that. And then he's got me looking for any drug paraphernalia and we have found some white powder in the front. The best board has treated it like that. So it was it was good to see that scenario worked in to do that that sort of event now go get you thinking about it.	1.0

I got a call about my son's speech. Meaning and how they're like, well we can see and go through this process and it didn't like you want them to be good kids and you want them to be healthy and but yeah, then what if something is not quite right? How do you fix it? And I think the other thing with anxiety that I've kind of noticed just from other people in my life is I don't know exactly how to say it but like a lot of times people are anxious because they don't have a job. Job, or they don't have money, but you can't like you need resources and you need help but it takes money to have those resources. I know and so like just yesterday. So my sons having a really hard time at drop off still and it's it's a lot and so I contacted this place and they're like, oh we're out of network. It's going to be like three hundred fifty dollars for the screening and you know, so it's like, okay. I'm trying to deal with this thing. I'm trying to You know, I'm trying to do the right things, but I can't spend $500 on a problem that lasts 5 minutes in the morning, you know, so I think that's the other thing that's tricky about mental health is that first of all, you have to want to get help because I don't know how many people I've tried to help and if they don't want to get better sure they can't they're never going to get better. But even people that do want help sometimes it's it's hard financially to to get the help that you need.	-1.0

But for the most part it should be about cleaning surfaces and I do have a minimalist approach, although right now, I feel like I don't have enough stuff in my living room because when I first decorated my living room when we moved in, Had put a small plant stand below a picture just to kind of balance out a certain wall and I put a plant there, but now I ended up moving that because people kept bumping bumping it and it was just kind of flimsy and then now they have something else set sitting on top of it. I think it's the modem or something like that and they have it moved over by the TV.	1.0

What are some things that are acceptable today by the world that is So beating it to God or that's exposing like are weak faith in God, right? Because sir, I in chapter 16 verse 3 sir. I took matters into her own hands by giving hag are to her husband Abraham, right her weak faith in God. She said God has prevented me from having children. She had trouble believing God's promise like Abraham in chapter 12, right, which says let's go back to chapter 12. God said God. I mean God told him that are I'm sorry. No in chapter 12 when he goes to Egypt and is like look you are a very beautiful woman. He says this to Sarai when the Egyptian see you they will say this is his wife. Let's kill him. And we can have her so please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life in treat me well because of their interest in you. So here's the thing Abraham's lack of faith that God would protect him. He took matters into his own hands write and tell Sarah to act as his sister and it creates all these problems while they're in Egypt same thing with Sarah when she took matters into her own hands because she had trouble believing God's promise out of this lack of Faith came a series of problems now. I want you to think of our your life or I'm thinking of my life right now how this happens when we take over for God right trying to make his promises come true through efforts that are not in line with his specific directions. Sometimes God gives us a promise. Sometimes we hear God calling us like, okay like	1.0

So today I worked from home and when I work from home, I'll bring him to the bus stop like in a hoodie and my flip-flops sometimes and then come back and maybe get back in bed if I can or if I have work to do just start doing work, but it's just a little bit more comfortable. Like I don't have to race to the bus stop but most days I bring them to the bus stop and immediately leave like tomorrow and I just get on the train and I get to work but I am not at all awake in the morning and what wakes me up is my temper at them not being awake.	1.0

All right, so is is for me it's a 50/50 thing 50/50 in that, you know, I was 17 so I didn't know shit about nothing. Right and it's that's naive Tay that you have that when you're that young that I think protects you from the realities of the entertainment business now personally, I always thought we was making fire because of what the movie was. I was like yo, this is like our life, you know what I mean? Like I could relate so much to the film that I felt like I would go see this, you know, but then you know, this is me saying it in hindsight, but you just there's so many variables that come into you know, the filmmaking process the timing the market Yada, yada yada, but personally I always felt it was going to be fired. You know what I mean? Because I was a part of the process again. I'm on set with pot we doing this scene. We doing that scene and storylines going here going there. I thought it was dope.	1.0

That's that's rough math. Like they say there's all the time and the music industry. Designed to keep you in debt and this is just another example of it man. It's a lot of these little backwards deals that they that they toss in there to keep you to keep you working to keep they pockets lace while you get next to nothing out of it. It's just it's sad bro. Like I don't ever want to see nobody go through that. Especially someone that works like, you know, the way we know all know Kanye works okay ago in the hibernation and work for like 6 to 7 months straight. No and very seldom calling out for For some time. So I just think that's it's just toughness like never Rockefeller of all, you know of all places like kind of crazy. It just makes you think different about a lot of people that we'd be celebrating even the labels that we'd like yo, they was getting it. It's like yeah, but at what cost a lot of people like basically selling a soul just to get on and years later 15 years later. They still can't they can't even break free of that shit. Like I was just explained with the de la Sol's Shit that they came out with 30 years ago today, you know saying they can't even say not even getting money off of that which is crazy.

Well, I don't like tapering. I pretty much do everything. Everyone says you shouldn't do Don't really take the much. I hate it. This one I stop moving my body just seems to Fall to Pieces.

Basically first it was to lose weight and then, you know just loved it more than I did my first 5k first 12K, then my first half marathon which in I was living in Darwin at the time and I just I'll never forget that feeling a finish my first half marathon. It was just like I never in my dreams thought I'd be able to do that, but someone like me to do a half marathon. Um, yeah, it was a wonderful feeling and then you just keep pushing the envelope that bit further you people thinking maybe I could try doing this and that's just that's just how it happened to I've had some time off here and there in the past. I've got had been injured and when I was pregnant and after I had my daughter I had some time off but you're just the past maybe four years. I've really really got back into it.	1.0

So I think I thought about this one and that there's two things that I want to say is that the first one is mine. I did touch on it before but when I was going through a by period in my business having to look at different income streams for staging so I created my packages and my style to stay service. So that was the first one and the second one and I think backup touched on this in her interview was that I had these staged a property and owner came back and said we had left scuffs all up and down the hall. We didn't and he never came back to me about it, but it was putting in a process of actually photographing the property before we even put Furniture into it so that we have evidence of anything that could go wrong afterwards.

Welcome to the construction Brothers podcast. I'm your host Tyler Campbell and with me like he is every week giving me a smirk my brother Eddie Campbell. That was just a smile. That was a smirk its mark means I'm up to something. Well, we got an awesome show for you. Today. We're going to be talking to mr. Tyler / a of f of my Consultants about Mega projects. We were really excited to get to that here. In a moment, but first things first, I'm like to bring something to your attention. No, no, no don't don't don't so it's been cold here in Middle, Georgia. Eddie of you. Have you noticed that it's been a little bit cold? Yeah, give the fact it was like 80 directly before the 29. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed Yeah, so in case you guys don't know we live in Middle, Georgia Middle, Georgia can't make up its mind on whether so we'll go from 80 degrees one day and 30 the next it will just drop overnight. It's absolutely insane. Yeah, actually did that last week it literally did so but here's the thing Florida also got smacked with this little cold front to and there was a little news article that HuffPost put up that I was Giggling at earlier. So some things are falling out of trees and they're not the Coconuts. Are they snakes? They're not snakes. I was hoping there was no not snakes. Again. We passed on that no coconuts and no snakes. They're not monkeys. What are they? So the National Weather Service Office in Miami tweeted don't be surprised. If you see iguanas falling from the trees tonight as lows drop. Up into the 30s and 40s, brr. Yeah, especially if you're an iguana, so it's something that they don't usually talk about and I've heard of this before whenever it gets really cold down in Florida iguanas start falling from the trees because they just they can't handle it. They're not dead. They're just Frozen. Well, they're cold-blooded. Yeah. Yeah, so cold weather is kind of tough on something like that counting that subsists because of the Sun and its heat when that goes away has a hard time. It's true. It's true, especially when in trees I'm going to read on a little bit so iguanas aren't dangerous or aggressive to humans, but the damage seawalls sidewalks and Landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. Actually. I didn't know that did you know that a Guam has dug tunnels? No. That's kind of terrifying that's news to me. It's like a dinosaur digging a tunnel a mini dinosaurs a micro dinosaur building a tunnel it is I wonder if elon's going to like get 200,000 iguanas and like try to get them to dig tunnels under Ela or so. That's how he's gonna get us how he's gonna do it. He's not actually going to use a machine. He's just going to get all of the iguana's he's got a tiny Army of iguanas. To dig his tunnel under Los Angeles. I mean the man's genius secret. That's the secret. What you do is you have to harness them together. So you get to Belt any straps groups of ten together and then he makes this massive circle of iguanas that he just sets underground and they start chopping away does the circle spin I think so like a carousel. Yeah. It's like a vertical Carousel with iguanas. Yeah. He leads them. Buying by using electric heaters. So he basically entices them with a heat source. And so they move towards the heat source. It's science everybody history. It's mr. Tyler Perez going to be proud of this intro I can hear now. Hey, man, you should have done your research before getting interviewed by us. You didn't know you didn't know. I don't know nothing about nothing. But that intro man. We are smart around here at school this week. I would like to introduce a new segment and we're going to call that segment. Shower thoughts buckle up. For those of you that don't know there is a subreddit called our shower thoughts on it. You can scroll through and a lot of people just post their post their shower thoughts on there. And a lot of these are are quite interesting. So I kind of wanted to take some time today and read them to you and I figured we'd all have a nice little chuckle about this and or Break our brains a little bit just because of how awesome these are they deep. Some of them is this like deep thoughts. Let me give you the let me give you the first one on my list. Okay, if your thumb is chopped off you lose your middle finger. Yeah. Okay, I can see how this would be a mind-blowing thing. More people have stood on the moon then on your desk. That's not true. Is it not know how is it not true because more people have stood on my desk. No, it's not. How do you know who stood on your desk? Why are you standing on your desk for what have you stood on your desk? I've never stood on my desk. So how can you make this argument? Because somebody else has who small people though? We're not going there. Why can't I talk about my kids on the show man? I'm gonna he's not. Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, I thought you were going another way with that. But yeah, okay fine. No Tyler. I was not and I would like you to go read the employment posters now because spiders mold every time you think you see a dead spider you might be looking at the skin of a live spider that is now larger than it was before. I did not need to hear that today. No, I know you love spiders. Yeah - there are gallons of saliva traveling through the postal system at any given moment. I have a question. What do you like licking stamps and envelopes? Sometimes they had I don't know how you feel man, really mixed emotions. Yeah, really mixed emotions. Some of them actually taste. Okay, if you think about it, it's kind of got a muted taste. It's not anything earth-shattering. It's not like Gordon Ramsay himself cooked something and slathered like some broth on the outside of the envelope for you to lick. Okay, let me bring this full circle. Okay. Is there a market for envelopes that taste good? I think there is actually there are envelopes out there that tastes good are there. Yeah, I think there's there's why with me yeah, this is too obvious. Yeah. Like popcorn slathered in butter. That's terrible. Here's one for you. All numbers are closer to 0 than they are to Infinity. I just watch Teddy's head explode. Okay. All right here. Oh, okay. Now here's one dentist study the dangers of plaque in order to receive a plaque that says they can remove your plaque. That's a lot of levels of plaque it is it's like plaque exception. How do you feel about flying? I think that it's a good idea. And most of the time I leave it at that I always bleed every time I floss then the lady over at the dentist's office is always like this because you don't floss and I'm like, but I bleed when I flies I'm like so you're telling me that I would build calluses between my teeth and my teeth holes that would it would prevent the bleeding. And your and your teeth Caverns dude. I I I call Shenanigans. I think big floss is out to get us probably is yeah. Yeah. No, this is all just a racket and all the Mr. In it. They're out there trying to sell their Wares trying to sell us string string with mint flavoring on it in some cases. You know what all this time. They could be tied in with the envelopes to the the people that make the tasty envelopes. Because you think about it. It's the same technology. You're applying Taste of paper, you know, like or like string or like textiles you haven't lived though until you got that piece of popcorn stuck in your teeth in the floss comes in for the rescue and saves the day I got used to do that. No, that's your penalty for eating popcorn. I refuse to use no, I will not use floss to dislodge a popcorn brightest popcorn have to have any kind of punitive value attached to it because Because when it comes out you can eat. So you're saving it for later? Yeah gives you it gives you something to do. What do you think of beards for? Well, why do you think I have a beard to save it for later? Obviously. It's crumb catcher. That's what it is. It's your peanut butter and jelly for lunch. By the way, I didn't have peanut butter and jelly belly. Well that's even scarier than what's in my beard. All right. Well, let's let's move this thing along. Let's talk about Tyler / a so he came in and he wanted to discuss mega-projects FMI is really huge in finding reports and collecting information and spreading that out to people Eddie. I feel like this was more Show then mine listening back to it because you had you just nerded out on a lot of these factoids. This is just right in your veins. So I think I think we should just call this one the Eddie show. Haha. Yeah now I still construction Brothers man. No, no, it's the Eddie show. Okay. Yeah, but I think I said like two words and you hear a chuckle from me. All right, that's it. Everybody comment if you like that format and everybody comment if you miss me. Mom that's that's shit. I'm looking at you that's dangerous man. He had me nerding out because I'm I'm curious about what's going on in construction. Mmm, and he's got he's got research to back up the things that he's saying. Yeah, and so when he's coming at us talking about mega-projects talking about market trends talking about what's going on with Our labor shortages, he has resources and knowledge to back that up. And I think that there is going to be a lot of value to this show. Mmm. Maybe not just may not be for absolutely everyone. I think it's going to be intriguing for most. Yeah, and there's a lot of content here that I feel like just great content, but I do see people that are on the front end of construction trying to decide what they're doing. With projects and how they're how they're going about business right here in a lot of value here. One of the things that really stuck out to me back to the labor shortage. He was saying that we lost a lot of that labor back in O8 during the crash. Yeah, they left and they just never came together came back. And so that is something that we're facing now and something that gets a code often is we need labor. I don't know how many times I've read articles in the recent past that say, I mean, Can too are you a human being do you have a pulse? And those are your requirements? Do you know how to get out of bed? Like we're that starved for Laborers. I'm only being a little silly. Yeah, like I have read articles that are really not far off at in construction Publications. And so yeah, I mean talking about that the Scout of be something of interest to people listening if you're in the construction industry and you have to Source labor, I know that's something We experienced here. Yeah, how do we find talented people get them here retain them train them the way we do things and then leave and effective team. Even if you're a labor in you know in the workforce right now, this could be encouraging to you, you know, and maybe you could start looking at things that you do in a different way that hey maybe I can leverage this. Maybe I can leverage these skills that I have to build up a business, too. Fit in to that that missing piece in our industry. Maybe you can digital. Yeah, maybe you can just realize that you are a valuable part of the industry. You are. Yeah and that your commodity it's hard work, but we appreciate everybody out there doing that every single day. Yeah stay at it. Yeah. All right guys, well, we're going to go ahead and move along and we're going to get into our episode with Tyler Gray. All right, Tyler. Thanks for joining us today.	1.0

Now that's that's yeah. I think I think I mentioned before you know in the last two years, especially I've seen the change in agents attitudes towards it but at the same time there's been a lot more businesses and people entering the industry and especially in Capital Cities. I think it's it's a very low barrier to actually enter the industry given you have these higher options or you know, I'm simplifying at a lot. So I'm being overly simplistic, but it is as simple as You can convince somebody to use you to style their home. You can do it tomorrow, you know, you can you can go to a higher company if you're in a capital city and you don't have to own anything. You don't have to actually outlay any costs other than your time obviously to build a business beyond that takes a lot more commitment and energy and cats and all those things. But you know in terms of setting up day one to test it's very easy to actually put your toe in the water if you were to go and like and I should also clarify that and say, you know, it took us a couple of Months before or phone calls and meetings before got our first job. So it's not as simple as that, but you know in I guess as you say young industry with low barrier to at least enter in the early years, it makes sense that we're seeing a lot of businesses pop up.	1.0

So and I don't know if this is going to be relatable for many of you are not but sometimes I need to go through my Roars and hang some things up to make room for things that I want to keep in the drawers because I have more room in my closet than I do in my dresser and I don't want to get another dresser dressers are expensive and I already have a couple plastic units with drawers like one of them is in my master closet.	-1.0

This is the content it makes a lot more sense to every 100 percent and the fact that we get to do just some basic steps together and just show America what it's supposed to look like. So like let's say Argentine to our just a regular Tango, right Ballroom Tango. They show like I don't know. How long is it like 20 seconds of it, but they show what it's supposed to look like. So in the audience at home is watching they can relate to it. Okay, that's what it's supposed to look like. Well his I'm wasn't exactly like that. So I guess I see what Lana is talking about. Exactly. It's tough.	1.0
Um, it was probably I feel like the one that was angry was when I was like livid at the show, which was after the still Leah episode and I can house When doused Eric wasn't going to happen and all of this craziness was happening was there is what was it called? Um, so it was the collective that Teen Wolf People we're going to create like their own Tumblr called the collective and they were going to upload like you could upload pictures of fan art and whatever and it was so obvious like they were only going to include hetero Actual fan art like they weren't going to allow / shipping and it was just a way for them to like control their fandom like the Teen Wolf and um, and I got a message from somebody who like I can't reveal who they are, but they worked with like this system. It was like listen you have influence amongst the Teen Wolf and mm based on like how popular you are and you have a voice if you speak out. Out against this it will like stop the Teen Wolf people from trying to do whatever it is that they're doing and so they were like you can write a post and just like tell the fandom don't you know mess with this Collective crab don't you know join this? Yes, just you know a way for them to control the fandom and then I like I've looked at like their terms of service or whatever and it was like if you upload a piece of fan art, they You can complete control of that own it own it to like do whatever it is that they want to do with it. So I just formulated this giant post and then I think I uploaded like I posted it before the collective even dropped. So like it was before like it got announced that it was gonna be like into like for like usage. So I uploaded it and people just went crazy over it saying I'm not using this. This is crap blah blah blah and then the piece ER guy who worked at the time for the Teen Wolf PR like ranted on it and like sub tweeted me and he said he said something like like I hate when people who don't know what they're talking about come in and ruin something that you've been working on for like months and I'm like, well, sorry, we all know who that guy was and he still trash to this day.	-1.0

They were recording the third album that was fired by the way, and I don't know the on the business end of things, you know, she was a she was tied with the industry and all that. This is Prior to streaming. This is prior to this new wave of how you know, everything is done. And I don't know we just decided to do us, you know, and I've always been supportive whatever she wants to do like build a studio in the crib like what you know, take it at your own pace, but she was just like no I'm going to do my kids like I don't want to deal the industry, you know, and I think it is difficult. I think for anybody but especially a woman, you know, My once you have a baby and you know what, I mean, like you, you know, haven't her having had hustle so long. She just kind of wanted to take a breather and really be with her kids and not like do both but you know, she still she got some some joints in a stash for sure.	1.0
It was surreal. So, you know soju. Comes out and you know, it's just like, you know poison Hood came out. It was just like we felt like it was this new movement. You know hip-hop is everything is happening at the same time like you go back to that time frame. You can't just look back at my career. You gotta look it with hip-hop is that you got look at everything to inform you of how it felt to me because it was just like we just felt like we were at the tip of something, you know crazy happening right now. And if and for the culture this overuse were now but that's what this was like the the second birth of the culture and then, you know book this movie to program which for me was, you know again, I thought I was gonna play football. So now I'm getting to live out this kind of thing and the writer director of that film David Ward, he wrote major league and so while we were filming the program he was like, you know, I guess there's something contractually was happening with Wesley Snipes who played in the original Because I didn't really want to do majorly to that wasn't my cup of tea. But again that loyalty thing I'm like yo this dude gave me my second job site. Let's go rock. So when rock with that and then Higher Learning, I think John Singleton originally wanted to POC to play Malik, but then pop got locked up. And so then the, you know getting higher learning it was it was a glorious time. It was a great time. It was like, you know the to taste your dreams and to get to live them out is invaluable, you know, and You know, you know you making a little bit of money and you know, you just for me it was like surreal I was so young when this whole process by the time that I'm not even 21 by the time you know, Higher Learning is coming out. So it's just like boom boom. Boom.	1.0

This episode is brought to you by Verizon Verizon is more than a phone company Verizon Prides itself on being a reliable partner for business keeping operations of all sizes ready for what's next with new technology like 5G ultra-wideband Verizon is set to transform the Way businesses operate see how at horizon.com ready. From gimlet media. I'm Josh puccio and this is the pitch. On today's episode a Founder pitches his startup meant to provide TurnKey mobile apps for retailers. He insists it's unlike anything else on the market but in a world where it seems everyone has an app can be convince investors. There's really an opportunity here. Bill Nadel is with Forefront Venture Partners. Phil is all about the numbers will only go in on a deal if you can make the math work. If for some reason the members don't bite then the thing falls apart Jillian Maness is with structure Capital. She's quick to size up the potential in a start-up and its founder and you can count on her to put her money where her mouth is there is no doubt in my mind that you're going to do this. I really feel that Daniel Galati is with Comcast. He loves the high stakes of venture capital and he'll take a gamble on a long shot startup if he senses an opportunity in the billions. I think the only way to make money in VC is to take a non consensus view that turns out to be right and finally on today's episode angel investor James Alta jerr. He looks for Strategic investment opportunities where he can bring his expertise to help us start up really get off the ground. I would be happy to advise your company	1.0

This 250 I want to raise a much larger round relatively speaking and really go and really own this market Sterling is wanting to raise the 250 now to help them get to profitability with the plan of raising a much larger round in 2018. Sterling has made his pitch now it's decision time. Here's Daniel is how I feel which is I I'm a huge believer in Sterling Smith the founder. I think you're super Scrappy. I think you've pulled together a team on not that much money and you've frankly built a product that I think at least looks great relative to the other, you know, many quasi competitors or similar products that I've seen in the market my my I'm going to hold off on committing here because my biggest question is Good size. So I don't yet know how big if you get 50% market share or 20 percent market share of your target retailers. And I think all businesses need to start somewhere. I get the we're going after Nan retailers and I get that, you know story but I think you're going to have to nail your target sort of mid-market retail segment. First So my answer is I think it's really interesting. Would love to connect with you after the fact on Market size. Excellent. That's Amelia actually there. Really good segue to my control, which is I want to invest in a company where I can pour fuel on the fire where you have a scalable way of acquiring customers and I can add money to it that will let you explode that that's not here yet. Plus I'm afraid you're not raising enough money. You're going to go back and raise again, very soon. Your focus is going to have to be on fundraising and not on sales and marketing. I appreciate that and and that that's a distraction to me. That's a distraction. I'm concerned about for you.	-1.0

No. One and and I was really in the snowboard. I still am in the snowboard. I said a word all the time and we had this local little Hill in Indiana where I grew up and my uncle worked there and I was able to always take cameras and these were different cameras at the time. So now we're talking like late 2000s mid-2000 like Sony Handycam exactly TV Sony handycams. I had I had the first Sony Handycam that was the HD 1080p model, but that was kind of like senior year of high school. I don't want to jump too far ahead. But dude, I was the typical. Later kid with a camera, you know, we've all heard that story. You know, I filmed my brother. We filmed each other skating we film snowboarding, but it was cool because I manage the terrain park at this local Hill. I don't call it of ski resort. It was a hill, but we had a kick-ass Park man. It was really cool like we there was huge jumps for how small this place was. We built we would go in and Weld and paint the rails in the summer. So then we would beat they'd be all new for the winter time. But what was cool as we had this part crew and they were all the best Riders from kind of around, Indiana in Northern, Kentucky. Leave it or not. Yeah, there's Northern Kentucky snowboarders.	-1.0

Oh just put this stuff out walked out because I figured it was an employee. But if I look at him closer and realized he didn't have a name Paragon I would have gone off on that dude. I want a bit like bro. You don't work here get out of my face before I rock you right now, bro all wrong. First of all, this dude was looking like freaking. Looking like freaking the nerd comic book guy from The Simpsons bro. This guy was big. He looks like a mix of Bob Ross and Peter Griffin. Yeah for real like actually with like a flat backwards on his head looking like a whole dude. This is like some 40 or 50 year old dude backwards.

So then I am International Institute of home staging put on kind of a seminar in Sydney back in 2015, and I just thought I'll just go and see what it's all about. And that literally was my lightbulb moment. This is actually what I want to do for the rest of my life is home staging so there was a series of events and I think the universe kind of led me to that seminar that Naomi had put on in Sydney back in 2015. And the rest is history So within that three months of attending that seminar I was back in Beaker and rather home staging was born that's amazing how quickly it's happened.	1.0

There are some actors that you feel like you personally know because they play roles that remind you of folks in your family and your neighborhood or people you went to school with. So in 1999 the movie The Wood came out and it really is one of the most underrated movies because what made that movie special. Is while it was based in Inglewood those characters could have been coming of age and Detroit Chicago really anywhere now Omar Epps my guest today on Jamel Hills and I'm bothered has been in a few movies that are just like that from Jews to Love & Basketball, even the program he has had an incredible career that has spanned some years. He joins me today to discuss not just his career, but the book he wrote about black fatherhood his days as a former MC in case y'all didn't know he used to spend on the mic and Why we've never seen him and Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin in the same room now, but all jokes aside. Very pleased to welcome Omar Epps. He's up next. Because I'm such a gracious host especially to guess whose work. I've admired for a while and you know people who I get the sense even though Omar you and I don't know each other that well, but you know, I fuck with you, right? So because of that, of course, I'm gonna open with something that I'm sure you have a lot of thoughts and opinions that plays right to your strength. Let's talk about your damn Cowboys. Ha ha ha. Wow. I know what a what an opener. Yeah, like real Graces of me to like bring up something. I'm sure right now for Cowboys versus everybody is a sore subject. So where do you stand on Jason Garrett? Because a lot of is to some degree typical after a loss that people immediately direct all their anger and frustration at the coach. So that's kind of common but with Jason Garrett is just has always felt as if there's been this love-hate relationship between him and Cowboys fans who are expecting more you always expect more but in particular this year, so what's your assessment of?	1.0

Yeah, this one was. Not as dramatic, I guess though. I did want to share. You know, I'm flying back from San Diego on Thursday and like they announced right before takeoff that there would be no Wi-Fi and I'm like, here we go again, like let me put out to the world that I'm not going to have Wi-Fi for the next handful of hours just so that when they inevitably trade Francisco Lindor and I'm just silent and not doing any reporting. It's not my fault and then I realized about I don't know. Most of the way into the flight that United has that they have that I message option. So you turn on their Wi-Fi and you of iMessage so I had nothing else but I had iMessage so I turned it on and you and some other people have texted me. You just said Bill Dance and Eddie a statue and I'm like, oh my God, they traded Linder and they got a hall from the Dodgers like and this is seriously happening happening now, and I texted you back and I said, All right, I think well it was in the Chicago. So I had a layover in Chicago. So it was on the Chicago part of the flight and you know that flights like 45 minutes. Yeah, and I think I had 25 minutes left in the flight and I'm like do I need to pay the 1099 for Wi-Fi for the you know, even though I'm gonna have to put away my laptop in 10 minutes and you're like no calm down. It's some knucklehead who covers the Falcons on the radio who comes out with this room, but I was pretty panicked there for a couple of Minutes and I thought we were going to have a legitimate part 2 to the annual tradition of not having Wi-Fi in a cross-country flight after the winter meetings.	1.0

Anyways, like it was wicked random. So we again the Uber we're on the way. I remember we were like jamming to like Kanye. He's like new life of Pablo album came out. I was like feeling myself young listening to famous and it was just we are thriving and so then we get there and we wait in line and in line she was like, are you gonna go? When if if I don't get in and vice versa and I was like, well I'm going in like it's her birthday. Yeah, and she was like, you're gonna leave me and I was like, well, I don't know like let's just see if we get in I get in she hasn't. Yeah, he doesn't knock it in I well let's talk to the thing is is my boyfriend went in first because I didn't want him to be involved with like time. Yeah. I didn't want him to be involved and we didn't want to be involved with like The under-21 bullshit right? Because like it's just not cool. And so I was like you go in like get whatever get your coat checked and do you it's the dead of winter. I'm in like a strapless jumpsuit and last time he high heel in Turin is you kind of Wonder I'm isn't though. Like, I don't know. I'm literally walk home. You're like frostbite. You've walked 20 miles and you're just like and you wake up like purple and you don't feel anything like hi. Good morning. Hello. No, so he goes in I go in I turn around she's denied but I'm in okay. So I was and I got in I was like girl didn't I was like, I'm sorry, so she standing out there and I was like, I'll call you an Uber. I had it connected to my Dad's credit card at the time and I was like, I'll call you an Uber and she was like, I don't want an Uber I want to get in and I said well, I don't really know there's nothing I can do so, I don't know how long she stood. Out there, but I went in. It was the year of being a selfless bit like selfish bitch. I just wanted to get him on all you did when you weren't 21. All you wanted to do is get in like you're gonna leave your friends, but it's like hard to even think. I mean, I'm only 20 years but it's so hard to think about when I wasn't 21. Yay. I like don't because you literally had to like fight to get into places or even like pay them. I give them like throw my like, I remember Haley like let me use her. I think it was Haley. Yeah someone let me use their ID one time. Thank God it's it's stressful. Yeah, you got any of like makes it more fun accomplish this massive feat. So like I'm not turning around. Also, I was wasted so like sorry, but then I see a couple of friends from home. I know my friend won't mind if I shut like shout him out his friend. His name is Devon. He he came in he visited he's a Ellie stop eating the bed. All right. We met we need to sell your bed. Yeah, we need to do a lot of things. We need to train her Ellie. Don't lay on the phone. Okay, so she'll lay right here. She'll hang out all that her belly. So then I take photos with him. He was living in San Francisco at the time. He he's a flight attendant for I think United. Yeah United and so, you know, I was just so happy to see him. I was so happy to be with my friends. I was so excited. And I got completely wasted like Beyond life my boyfriend at the time went to the bathroom. He was gone for maybe three minutes. Like I don't really know he could have been gone longer and I just thought he like I don't know what happened. I thought he was gone for hours. He wasn't though and he was like Andrea. I literally just went to the bathroom. It's time to go home. It was like 1:30 in the morning Nicki Minaj was playing. People were twerking. It was just getting wild and people weren't working. I know and I never I never learned how to twerk. Like I'm either I like tried, but which is Barren because I've been like a dancer and cheerleader. I should know how to do that. But I should have Kaylee come on in like give an example or like give up a step by side Kaylee green. She teaches teachers teach you how to twerk. I need that I've other friends I can talk to and I just like can't like, you know what that's actually a lie. I use when twerking was for a school. I definitely get to work and now I'd like got old and I can't anymore. I'm just if I break a hip same so hey, I'll I'll finish my story so real quickly. So Taylor can get onto hers, but we leave we're in an Uber I of course get the spins. I don't really remember why but I was like, I'm gonna fucking puke and so then we get out of the car. We're on Comm Ave for like by bu I get out of the car my ex gets out of the car and he's like bitch. What the fuck and he's horrified Ellie. Does he growl at you know, she was trying to play you were trying to play. It's okay baby, and she and I rip off my seven-inch heels like stilettos like it was not a drill. I pulled him off like they weren't going back on then. There and he the minute he saw my heels coming off. He was like God damn it. She's down for the count like eventually, you know, we call multiple Ubers multiple cabs. They won't let us in because I'm blind different and being probably psychotic and cops show up and they're like, hey, what are you guys doing? And I don't know why this is the first thing my underage self decided to say, but I was like, I'm not	-1.0

Well, I remember I forgot what year it was, but it was in December of one year that I was talking to the people from the after-show and back then I think Steph was kind of like you're not supposed to talk about it. Like it was already starting to get to that point but it wasn't as bad as it got with the rest of the show because they wanted me to get on that show. Show and I was talking to like the people behind that and I was supposed to be on that show and then it kind of stretched a few months. Like I was supposed to be on in December and then that got rescheduled there was some sort of like internal problem with the filming or whatever. So then it was rescheduled to like March or something. And then when we got to March it was like, oh, you know this guy handed off to different people like different Executives that took control over it and then I was kicked off. Then they got whoever I don't know. Who else.	-1.0

Hi, this is Mary HK, Troy and you're listening to Hey, cool life a micro pot about mental health and creativity. Hmm. It is January the 23rd 2019 and this is episode 22 in reality. It is actually the evening of the 22nd. But um I'm a very early morning tomorrow. So I am trying to record it tonight and seeing how it goes. I've already done that thing where I fussed too much and premeditated too much. So I've tried recording it once before and I didn't like the results and I was having this Stern conversation with myself being like the whole agreement was that you Just deliver the first Pancake no matter how misshapen and raw the dough but then the sort of staunch like determination with which I refuse to let myself even like mess with it felt really ungentle.	-1.0
It was a different time again. Like when we look at how it is. Now, everything is so fluid and you know, but before everything was so rigid like this. Is he even back then it was like whoa. If you do television, you'll never be a film star. If you know, if you do film you can't go to tell like people looked at television like it was beneath the people still looked at, you know, you can go on to be a Broadway Legend and like with the music The Duality thing was was kind of rare back then I mean even when you go back before my time is You know, very make Barbra Streisand, you know what I mean? And Frank Sinatra was never really considered an actor. They were just taking advantage of situations, but you didn't certainly from the black side of things. You can see that Duality like that. So, you know, I never really everything happens for a reason and I know I put my all into it so I don't have any regrets in that way. Like I never feel like oh if I would have took this seriously like not took it seriously. I got I got thousands of songs in the stash. So, you know just Just it just wasn't meant for me to do it at that time.	-1.0

For me, the the unit of account of function is the derived one. So you have these three function that you find the text books rather three main functions are sort of value unit of account and medium of exchange. Okay, and the essential function of one is to serve as a medium of exchange so much that that's my point of view. Right? So we have this is the essence of money to are generally used medium of exchange but with that but without coercion Well, I mean the whole stew even for those monies that are being imposed right in one way or another right? So it's the generally used medium of exchange and then as a consequence you calculate in terms of that money unless they're very strong inflation or something like this, right then you need to calculate other different places, but the foundations, of course indeed to serve as a store of value and here indeed we have problems with Bitcoin because Bitcoin only serves as we evolve. Exchange or is a store of value for services right now. It's a speculative object and so on but it has no other function whereas precious metals have multiple. Alternative uses not only in jewelry. But yeah, very numerous industrial uses because of the particular very special physical characteristics of these Metals. So that means that in the case of all it's only always have a fallback position and there's always an additional demand industrial demand or non-monetary demand that serves as a buffer to salvage the these Metals if ever the monitor uses put into question. So on bitcoin is much more fragile about that because it has no natural non-monetary use. So I think Bitcoins have come into circulation and can be kept there thanks to the ideological now and not in the negative sense right would just say libertarian talking exactly. Do you need to have people as the commitment who are ready to absorb the losses that come with a fall in the value of Bitcoins some if everybody just cells Because the price is going down. Well Bitcoins will be driven completely out of the market. So for this not to help you need to have people who are committed to bitcoin. So you don't consider it merely as a monitor your financial instrument now in the case of gold and silver you don't need this you because gold and silver have always other users and people who are active in jewelry or who use: silver cellphones or Aerospace. And however, they will be happy if prices go down and so you don't need that sort of emotional intellectual commitment to this. So therefore they are more robust Bitcoins.	1.0

No, but I also I mean guys who are two months from free agency and don't have much trade value. I don't put that on them. I will say the one other one that made you scratch your head at least was last year with trading ideas because I don't think people like that but that wasn't like especially at the time because people didn't really know about Jack Bauer's and he was a top under Prospect like that wasn't what I don't I cannot think of an example ample where they made a trade and it was like, oh my God, they get host. What are they doing? Like you usually have a pretty good feeling about the deal at the moment and it's going to be interesting because like the Dodgers of their their roster and their farm system are loaded. There's so much opportunity, but I don't know it's going to be if they don't include Lux. Is there a way for fans to be no?	-1.0
Yeah, they're they're taking their Fortnight, you know connoisseurs and trying to bring it over here. Like now that stuff doesn't fly all the time. It doesn't come go one to one all the time, you know, and I mean, I think the only thing is like, yeah, you can't really slide as as good but your actual like speed Really isn't affected all and so yeah, I think maybe it is just a mind thing. So we just opened up the floodgates now, it's just going to be like everybody's going there taking vacations. We're good. We ruined it speaking of ruining it number four is the pit. The I think my favorite thing about the pit is nine times out of time then again, if I drop at the pit, my next stop will always be the slums because because of that Redeploy their it is always really good. And I mean no matter where the ring is. The redeploy will get you close enough where you can kind of take your time. So you can you can go all over the pit. You can go all over the slums get to that Secrets place that we were talking about and still have enough time like okay, I better go ahead and hit that redeploy. And then you start going towards, you know, like the what's that bunker called like to the West I mean, it's just like this big kind of Hangs over the mountain kind of hangs over the Cascades and stuff. I don't know what it's I don't know if that's named technically. So it's kind of like what it's just a little bit south of artillery, right exactly that so you can kind of start heading that way you won't make it because there's a little Bridge area but even that bridge area has some decent loot. I mean, I don't think you'll have high tier loot but it is a there's a good little stop there along the way and then even if the circles bearing down on you the the Outer Circle will most likely be somewhere around like Cascades. You know that first or that round to Circle usually will be right around Cascades no matter where it ends up on the on the map so you can make it there. Absolutely. No problem.	1.0

So even in the winter, I will go down to just like a cami which is if I don't know people in other countries listening I've realized that there are some new stats available to me. So I realized that only 79 percent of you are in the United States. So some of the terminology with our English could be a little bit different when I just throw out these random terms like I'm wearing a cami but it's a tank top a little spaghetti straps and it's something that I use. As an undershirt when I was out grocery shopping earlier. I had a t-shirt over it like if I'm wearing kind of a low-cut top. I like to wear a cami under it to kind of give me a little bit more coverage in the front but around the house once I start cleaning, I definitely go down to the Kami because I tend to get hot and I guess I'm just not like everybody else. I remember shopping with my mom recently. And she doesn't live near me but when I was in town visiting and she was saying something about well, it's not really the time of year to be buying short sleeve shirts or something.

Yeah, that was terrible. It's just I mean, it's interesting because you saw Valentina read the other teens were having like a You looking club and she was so concerned about the club looking nice that she didn't think about the concept of who did you say was this you who were you referring to Valentina Valentina? Okay. Yeah. She's shading the other teams for not having it look nice. Right, but but there's the concept ended up being not as strong as the other one trunks doesn't look nice, but they do well. I'm usually drunk when I go in there so and then Naomi ended up fronting most of the work because like Valentina wasn't helping like write the scripts and she was kind of like joking on joking around while they were trying to like paint the set which is funny to watch but then you're thinking like if I was Naomi I would be I would probably be more like tents and visibly nervous. Because I would be like no dude. We need to get this props to her for like kind of caring that team. I feel like Valentina and I went back into her old because she'd kind of the same thing last her season when she wasn't like studying the words like she kind of just coasted through it and that what's in her home. So I felt like Valentine just like missed the mark on this missed the mark this episode. So I think so too. I just felt bad for her.	-1.0
I you know, that's a very common plot of a kids show like you look at I don't know if you remember this, I'm gonna pull out Nickelodeon. Sorry that this is a Disney podcast, but there's no sort of Drake & Josh where they do the same thing like Drake doesn't like a girl. More so he pretends to like be really disgusting to like get her to not like him. So I guess I think I'm used to heat like a spaghetti dinner. It's like I don't know but I feel like I'm very used to like that plot device which like again. It hadn't no it's not my favorite. But like it didn't bother me, I guess.	-1.0

Yeah. I mean, I'm actually you kind of make me feel a little bit better about myself because I thought it was just me because literally this is how it happened it came out and I want to say I started the stream because I think it was what was it was either 11 or noon my time. And so I started the stream, of course my wife got off right around the same time, so I had to go get freaking groceries. But I only got uh game in I got a single game in I got two kills which you know for me was actually really cool. But I got I got both of the kills because of the jump at the first was in midair and then the other one was after I had landed so it felt really satisfying and I'm like sweet this is how I'm starting off the season then literally I go grocery shopping. I get home. I get some food for the kids, you know, like shut up go over there and he And then I start my stream again and just out like you said I just started getting slaughtered left and right it was to the point where like high morale was just so low and I'm just like, oh my God, I'm I'm trash I hate this and yeah, I mean like I feel a little bit better knowing that it's not just me that apparently was a lot of people because yeah, that was that was what happened with me. It was so yeah. Oh my God, I felt bad for a couple of reasons. I mean for one, obviously, I have a podcast where or like here's some tips and tricks and how to get kills and so to get slaughtered like that really really puts a damper on your mood. That's number one. But then number two is I'm trying to stream it. So like for anybody heard out there who doesn't know I'm a bus driver and this week happened to be this week happened to be spring break for the Boise school district or so. I'm like, okay, I don't have to go to work. This is awesome. I have a whole week division to Now they're dropping the battle pass. And so I was starting to try to get a little bit of a schedule for my twitch going. And so I started that but I'm doing horrible just absolutely terrible and it yeah, it felt horrible and I'm like the other side of the coin is the fact that it's like well, I'm trying to entertain people but it is so hard to entertain somebody when you're just not having a good time. I mean just losing one after another after another. I was just like okay, this is this deck dad's when I get it.	-1.0
So stop with that. Yeah, but like, of course, I knew like that there were hypocrisies about Among the like Christian Community and so I don't want anyone to ever think like that's why like I left because I've always granted like there are you know, good people and bad people in every community and every group, you know, and so so I never really liked of course things could be hurtful but like that never caused me to then think like, oh, well God must not be true because all these Christians are hypocritical. Like it was never that way of thinking and I know it's hard for some people to understand like one of my videos recently got promoted by YouTube and it's actually really annoying because I have all of these Christians who are just so hateful like leaving so many nasty comments. I'm just like why are you liked so many people try to say like like not all Christians are bad, but like when 99% of the people are so I mean and then you get like one nice one and it's like okay obviously like something needs to change here, but they were all saying like you were never a real Christian. You must have never been saved like that's just impossible because and I feel like it's a defense mechanism where it's like if I was a real Christian and then left like what does that say about their belief system, you know, absolutely I think it's very fear and that's like it's so much projection and that's why you know,	-1.0

If you want to follow along with us, then pause the podcast and watch the two episodes and then come back and you can comment or let us know what you think about the episodes if we Didn't say something that you want to put out there anyways, so this episode opens with a concert which some of the episodes of Hannah Montana do. I don't know why a lot of the earlier ones. I filled it and I just it's confusing because that it opens with a concert and then I don't know it's like when was it filmed where was it filmed it because it seems like a legit concert, but it's not like in a studio like this a ton of people in the audience. What do you mean? It's not a studio? It doesn't look like a studio film space, you know, like okay, so, you know how like the difference between like for example the set at Rico's and then watching episode of like and emac like the the set is different. Like it looks like a legitimate set it like just like, you know what I mean? Yeah. Anyway, so I feel like the the concert at the beginning that's episode look like a real concert hall and that like a sound stage somewhere and a lot or whatever you think that you don't think are you saying?	-1.0

Which is only 14 months long, but you'll get to see our journey and follow them and see how they're thriving in their life. So definitely check in on that. If you've read my bio or the summary of the podcast you see on there that I am calling myself the mother of all mothers. So I wanted to explain that definitely in this episode. So I'm obviously a mom of multiples. So that's one type of mom that I am the second kind of mom is just being a bonus mom. So I do have a bonus daughter. So for those of you that don't know what that is. That means she's my step kid. She's my stepdaughter. She is what I like to call my part-time kid. We have her 10% of the time and she has with her mom 90% of the time so we have her basically two times a month and In that short time frame she gets to hang out with the kids which are her siblings and her dad. She is not vegan. I think that one time she did try and attempt to be vegan. She was vegan for the weekend and she it was really funny watching her. Look at the ingredients the way I do and she'd ask me is this vegan is this vegan and I'd guide her through it and then next time we picked her up. She was like, yeah. I know. I ate a hotdog and I'm like, wow, it was really funny. And she said no.	1.0
I love it. I love this. I really do. We've had a few questions from people and a lot of the weird random diems have to do with us and like the most absolutely hammered we've ever been It seems like we give the impression that we're drinking which we are we do. We do give that impression and I just want to say that yes, we enjoyed a drink but like we don't we don't do that every day, and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. No, it's we're working on it. We're working on our no so as we're drinking wine, so no, so basically a lot of them had to do. With stories of us and like the most Hammer we've been together and we were thinking and I said to myself. Well, I mean the most hammered I've ever been just hasn't been with her. Yeah. We kind of came to that conclusion that like we have been very much hammered together college high school, but God well no together. No, I know but you mean other than like being together. I like we're going to tell some stories and one of my stories of the most drunk. I've ever been has been in high school. I started early start him young start him young I really did. Like I had like a lot of things in high school, which mine was in college mines mines pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to start? I'll start. All right. Okay our love. Okay. So this was when I was 20 years old, so I wasn't 21 yet and I feel like when I turn 21 Unlike just a side note like I tamed down a little bit. That's not like as like yeah. Yeah, you're 21 like drinking song is fun anymore. Yeah, like don't get me wrong. There was no thrill. I mean there was a thrill they're still a threat or so, but this was back when it was like Wild and Woolly. Okay, so I was 20 and it was about three months before I was going to be 21 years old. So a bunch of my friends at that time. We're turning 21. It was junior year. Everybody was like had that calendar out, you know what I mean when like they were had like the 21 countdown. Oh, yeah, three months two months one month. So my friend had a birthday in January and she decided to hold it at this club called story bill and it's in Boston and it's it used to be super fun. I don't really know what it's like now, but I said to myself I'm going to go and it's going to be awesome and we're gonna we're gonna get in there and I had a fake ID at the time and it was a Real a real fake ID if that makes any sense. It was a real human being I had a girl from Suffolk who just like totally hooked me up like she had dark hair and blue eyes and just like she just let me have it. I gave her 50 bucks to get a new license and she just she was awesome. She was the MVP. So I had I had an ID and at the time I was eating a guy who was older so he was over 21 and I said, you know, we I really want to go to this. I want to celebrate her birthday. 'The day he said sure the day of the birth day comes I was I remember I like legitimately like of course went Forever 21 and like found a sexy jumpsuit with like a super crazy v-neck in it and I was like, I'm hungry. Yeah. I was like, I like feeling myself.	1.0
Sure, rough bro. It's the music. That's the that's the way it goes man. That's why it's like it's like now it's so much easier because most people can just go independent. But you know, then it was like, you know, you'll dream was to be on a major and get your music played on the radio and stuff like that like a lot of artists that going through that now like the product of the you know, I won't say pre internet but before the internet took control of the music, No, so that's just as is what it is man, they'd assign a lot of bullshit deals and paying for it right now to this day.	-1.0
Ann's in the fandom would get like we would get messages and like diems from people who are Anonymous who were like with the show and like there was instance where people from the show would like give us spoilers of like what's going to happen and it would be like written in a very vague kind of way but like you can get like the just of it and then when like the show kind of started turning against Eric, we would still get or at least I did we Get messages from like inserts in the show of like ways to like be one step ahead of like their mess. It's to like actively post about it. So that way when it came out fans will like already like in the know like fans already knew what the mess was going to be like had a way to like prepare for just how shitty the show was which was weird. Like I want to know who these people were who were like on the side of the fandom and not on the Side of the show like who like who would risk their job to do that? It didn't make sense. Here.	-1.0

Yeah. Well this your it's going to take you about 20 hours or so, I think yeah, I mean Yeah, what's crazy? What about the camera in particular? I remember and you probably remember to in Dark Souls 3 the camera of when they're you're like facing two bosses was always kind of annoying and I was like, well, I don't know how I'd fix it. You know like this is what are you supposed to do if there's to moving objects that you're supposed to keep on the screen. It's kind of impossible to fix but then this game for some reason it doesn't have that same issue. And even though there's like seven or eight enemies on the screen for some reason. I don't think about it. It's almost as if like the game was made with the intention of the camera as well, you know, like as a mechanic versus like making a level making a boss and then having a camera there like that's sort of what Dark Souls kind of fell into but it's true.	1.0

Aren't you master next RZ masks RZ masks? We bought four of them for the Department. We bought the EM ones with the F3 filters which are the carbon filters. They're really really great for mapa. Again. We were talking about him earlier tonight for medical calls. They're great for if you're on the if you're the pump operator is well and you're just getting kind of a little bit of excess smoke coming out. Its they're good for there. To ease them for them and they're great in the because they're neoprene is well, they're really good in the winter to keep your face warm and you're doing when you wandering around right? Like if you are at the idea, uh, they're very very useful still just the kind of take the edge off as well and and keep you moving forward. So if you would like to pick one up code you can use for 30% off is DTF. F for 30% off of your next RZ mask order. Again, we are not sponsored by them. We just bought them because they were good quality masks. We were looking for something a little bit less arduous like the like Runnin SCBA.

But as we are walking in the hall and we see up here, you know make eye contact and smile and say good morning or good afternoon or or something like that. I think that you know, I I know that you know, I've been in a lot of schools to where you know, you have teachers to get together and you know, when you get a group of girls together, sometimes sometimes we're not so nice and but sometimes you know, you see this kind of get-together chat chat chat or a teacher will be having the students come in and another teacher will join in and ask a question. And then meanwhile, there's interaction students are watching that so if we are if we were showing kindness to whoever is here, or if that conversation is anything less than kind about maybe a little gossip going on right students are noticing this so Be the person you want to see in your classroom. And of course, there's all types of great books out there on kindness and being paying it forward and you know being a good human. So those are things that we're going to want to incorporate in our classroom, but I think reading the books and checking that off. The list is not enough right?

Make sure the reinforcements are something you can keep up with. Otherwise, the behaviors may not be consistent either. You might find that throughout the season you will add new behaviors to your wish list and you'll probably change some of your reinforcements if they aren't working and add new ones only change something if it absolutely does not work or if you find that you cannot keep up with it.	1.0

I'm not sure. I've always thought for a very very long time that actually we have three options right from the current situation. We added also 20 years ago. Either we allow the government is no longer into beings doesn't try to bail out anybody and so on then we get a crisis and then we get actually a deflationary melt all of the whole system. As the first option the second option is you're just trying to inflate your way out of this and of course that's not really a solution but it will just Frank we will just wrecked the economy because you're the sooner or later you're getting very fast into hyperinflation. And the third option is and of very often is neglected. The third option is just to layer more and more regulations of the economy to it's late. But at the same time to eventually sort of Regulation to try to prevent that deflationary policies leads to higher prices leads to Greater redistribution and so on and so you're walking your way into a completely regulated into effect into a totalitarian socialist. And right now I think we're moving on a path of this way of this world now, that's that's a very I'm sorry. It is not very very very positive and in a bright Outlook, but I mean, we definitely need to take this into consideration. I mean, we cannot honestly all of the present situation is very fragile. So we all know so it's very unstable and cannot we cannot remain there. So where will be moving I think they But people who are running monetary policy or running the state the main objective is to stay at the helm a to keep running the country handed over to their friends when they they self themselves as step aside. So they will not consider the deflation or a mountain solution. They want to avoid hyperinflation. So the for them the way to go is more inflation and at the same time Again, I'm a greater control or the economy size. So I was yeah, if you think of something like the plunge protection T to they exist. Yeah, I mean, I mean the central bank doesn't call it the plunge for taxing to you. This is the jargon. Yeah.

That's totally that's that's a good I think that's fair because I felt the same thing like there are certain things that stuck out to me, especially in the first episode like remember that blue guy. Why none of that blue guy in the first episode he was so out of place in my eyes. Like he he totally like totally didn't fit the show because like the Mandalorian at it's very core. It seems to me like it's like a space Western, you know, and it's like everyone's grittier and it is cheesy in some parts like the I have spoken guy, but it's still totally relevant. But the blue guy to me in the first episode stuck out like a sore thumb like he he broke the tone for me. That's when I was like, oh this might Bad show so I share the sentiment but I think okay overarching lie like the show is darker grittier, but it still has that like that Star Wars cheese in it though. It's like the character like the hard thing is now to make the Mandalorian an empathetic character because he's not taking off his helmet. I think that's going to be really interesting.	1.0

So what's your I'm going to talk about cooking tips for people on their own what to buy and how the faith? Yeah. Yeah, we're not going to go alone. I like everyone else. I had a budget. I knew my total monthly net salary and I knew my expenses whatever I had left was for food entertainment in the inevitable birthday present. Yes. Yeah. I had my money in a credit union where every month they took out a certain amount and it was deposited into what I refer to as my rainy-day fund. Okay, when my yeah, it was a great thing on my car insurance bill came in once a year. It came out of the rainy day fund if I got a medical bill it came out of the rainy day fund saving it's important. Easy, but if you have a little stash of funds when something out of the ordinary occurs get a flat tire or something happens to your car, you know, whatever any little thing you have the money to cover it and it doesn't ruin your monthly budget. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great thing to have for Christmas presents to shopping. Say that again. Where did you go food shopping. I used to go to either the Stop and Shop or Star Market. Okay, the term Market isn't when I was I was living in Roslindale. Okay. Yeah, what's a good? Say that again. What's a good one a good cheat meal other than Ramen like a good meal. You know what when I was growing up I was growing up when I was living by myself, and I didn't want to cook but I happen to love. I love baked potatoes. Love them. That's what I go when I would do believe it or not. Open up the baked potato throw the mushrooms and peppers on top with a little bit of cheddar cheese. And it was delicious. I also used to do that.

Yeah, you know, I'm actually looking to supplement either I linebacker or defensive line here. Now this just to be quite Frank. This is not a good year for inside linebackers specifically when you start looking at the Packers thresholds now their thresholds for linebackers are actually relatively strict. There's never many prospects that meet them. So I think when they see Layers that are close to the thresholds or even meet them they're jumping all over them and there's only a handful of guys that you're probably even looking at here a guy like drue tranquill from Notre Dame. He's on that. He's on the cusp of meeting all the thresholds. A guy from Catholic. I like Cameron Smith from USC. Bobbio correctly from Stanford, but I didn't hear you. Say Caitlyn Saunders.

He's off come back in five years and we can have will be what are we watching?	0.0
Yeah, so and that is that is also really based on where you are in the country that we see in certain markets where you've had over expansion particularly multifamily. We do see it maybe not cooling off as the Word, but returning to normal, so Manhattan is a great example of this the multi-family residential boom in Manhattan. They were the let them in the market has doubled over the last five points there. And so it's going to pull back it's going to come back off of highs from probably probably do the extent to 25 30 30 percent decline of construction put in place, but it's still going to be a big building Market. It's just going to pull back quite a bit and it won't be as crazy competition will be fiercer DC star. Going to pull back a little bit in terms of Spin and so in certain Pockets where you can wrap intention Nashville's a great example, we've had rapid expansion over the last several years. We see a leveling off and maybe even a slight pullback, but you're also seeing a rotation and Healthcare sector fewer and fewer large sort of bed Tower Hospital projects coming out of the ground seeing a shift towards more. If you look at spaces like Hospitality hotels are going up all over the place, but the economy is good. Some people can afford to travel and so who broke warmest support the fact that what we've got more Travelers we ought to have more Hotel Beds.	-1.0

My piece of advice is we do not fake it till we make it but I do believe we become what we believe we are right on man.	1.0
Right? And I think it's interesting because first of all like a Navy a how we have to have like an individualized plan for every person based on their needs whatever it is, but that and also it makes me think of when we talk about validity and as we know validity is the idea is something NG men measuring the relevant Dimension that you intended to measure so right so like I might be like, oh my God, she is so healthy. She's so skinny. Right? Like I'm thinking that they're right her body looking a certain way that that indicates that she's healthy, but that's not really a valid measurement. Right? Like that's not valid if I'm measuring someone's like level of Health. However, you plan on measuring it it wouldn't be there skinny. Like when I think about it after I was hospitalized and so sick. I lost 25 pounds. I felt sexier than ever. But I was at my most unhealthy point of my entire life. I mean, you know, like everything was wrong with me. And so, you know to try measure like, oh she must be healthy. She lost 25 pounds. She's so on her shit, right? Like little did they know my fingers are falling off in the background or whatever is going on that. I'm sorry. I had c-diff or you know, like your body is completely out of whack at that point. So I think that's an interesting site on validity in terms of what we think measures. Health or what? We thinks measure someone having their life together or you know, and it's not actually that at all.	-1.0
A battlefield and yeah, well Firestone, but yeah Firestorm like we were talking about it on our Discord.

Like what I've seen of Firestorm actually looks really good and I'm like, okay that looks pretty cool. But there's one key problem about Firestorm and that's that I would have to buy Battlefield 5.	1.0

So, I mean that feels good something that fills professional and we did I think a pretty good job we learned a lot and that's definitely stuff we can talk about probably throughout This podcast as long as we do it we learned a lot we made mistakes. We did some things right and so we made a lot of mistakes and did some things right. We did a lot of things right and we made some mistakes but we learned from all those mistakes and what we're going to apply to the next movie jump see which we want to be really I wanted to be Top Notch.

Thought I was a different person and me being all dolled up with my makeup my heels my hair like it was curled. My hair was like curled like I was like really doing the thing. So Bethany thought I was some girl that she didn't like Bethenny was drunk as fuck. I like forgive her it's fine. Like she's been arrested like 10 times I Castleton like she no longer. I think she got like expelled from Casselton. It's fine. But so be bad, did he so interested? Um, well, yeah Bethany thought that I was a different girl like and me and Bethany like got along just fine, but she thought I was somebody else and so she poured a whole bottle of wine on my head a party and everybody just look here's Bethany like she'll Bethany. Yes. And so every this bitch pulls all pours a whole bottle of champagne on my head at a party in front of probably Hundred people and I was like, oh, this is an embarrassing or anything. I like go home and cry. But so I look over and she was like, oh my God, like she was probably unlike so many drugs and alcohol the bathroom. Okay. Goodbye. So what was I saying? So, yeah, so she turns around that. She's like like so turn out of her mind that she did say sorry. She was like, oh my God, like she didn't know it was she did not know that that was you whatever whatever she thought that you were somebody else and I was like, I think I was just speechless. I like got home and just showered because I was I had a whole bottle of champagne all over me Meanwhile. My boyfriend was living in a double-wide trailer with Three other men and I basically lived there too. And so I like go back to his place and like shower. Oh my God. It was just it was bad. And I think that was like the same night I could be wrong. But I think that was the same night that girl like got expelled. I have no hard feelings against that either like we're all young and do dumb shit. There's no hard feelings, but I just think that this story till this day is funny as fuck and I'm the one that got a whole bottle of champagne pour it on me and I still think it's funny. So love Bethenny Bethenny Bethenny and Mary. I just know I don't want to say names but Honestly hilarious though. Yeah, their name should be married. Bethany know their names will not be exposed. That's their real names though. Mary and Bethany probably this. So anyway, so yeah, I'm a little bit shorter, but my next one will be good Andrea back to you. All right.

Well Oliver. Well, I want to see the one thing that didn't dawn on. till now that would have you know, I never needed to panic because I scheduled a really early morning flight back and with the stopped at Chicago because I assumed that's the flight that the Indians front office Executives would take turns out they took a later flight closer to lunchtime. So they were in the air when all that was going down and when you had texted me and so I don't know why I panicked because I think they're means would have been pretty limited engaged in quote unquote serious talks as aunt.	1.0

I mean occasionally akid might wash their hands their if they used our restroom, but for the most part I have my own sink, he has his own sake and then the kids share a bathroom. So I decided that we didn't really need to have a pump of hand soap in the bathroom and I might change on this later. But right now I keep just a bar of soap but it's sink and one of the reasons I like to do that is sometimes if I'm getting ready in a hurry and I'm not going to take a shower that morning.	1.0

Well, I think you see it in the case of Greece right when the socialist government came to power the wake of 2009 to to positive the 10 2010 to the left actually, so they got elected because they promised to get wreath out of the Eurozone. Yeah, okay, and they did this they got elected but they didn't take grease all over Europe politicians lying. Well surprise surprise, but I think they were honest when they were running to be elected and then actually they did a lot of learning and they Folly considered what their options were. And the truth is grease dropping out of the Eurozone would have suffered an enormous door back in really comes. Okay, this is this is there's no comparison. I don't say it wouldn't have been good for the country at the long run. Yes. I do believe it would have been good for the country in the long run. Especially if you're no longer on the monetary Lifeline right on the heart-lung machine then well, actually your own economy starts developing organic. Actually production becomes more important than just spending spending money, especially spending other people's money. So that's certainly a good thing but that they would not have survived this politically and actually most of the voters probably would not have liked it. Anyway speaking of Greece right Aristotle once said that actually most people were born to be slave simply people actually most people they they they they don't mind but other people are telling them what they should do and how they should So on as long as they have a nice cozy house and a car and they have enough to eat and saw that they had basically these Aristotle it said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Yeah. Well, I mean for him. Yes, of course that that was the only life worthy of man. Yeah, and as as a rational being so what is our objective as a rational being its he would say well to contemplate those things that they are terminal. But that is not the opinion of most people so I think coming back on the Eurozone their fight. I think even though the problems are greater than the periphery. The cost of moving away from the Eurozone are also greatest in the periphery Germany could remodel The Zone it would be hard but Germany would get along I think actually would be a great relief for Germany because right now contrary to what politicians in Germany always profess maybe that Germany's greatest beneficiary of the Eurozone. I think we actually the guys are funding this writing in real terms because all we what we exporting are real goods and services and what we are getting Hey, what's up promises?	-1.0

I like that idea for the in-game. So it's like the last squad or something and I can't remember what episode it was, but we did bring up Titans in the fact that like what if it was I think it was actually it was our first reader mail and somebody somebody had brought up like It was something like evolve. We're like there was one person on each squad or there. You know, there is they tweak the numbers so that basically it was kind of like evolved in the sense that you had to hunt down this Titan and kill it and I think something like that or something, where's this super rare item? And then you'll be able to call it in but you have to go to like certain spots to call it in the you can't just like have it call in anywhere. Yeah, I mean because once again, I hate to compare it to Fortnight, but when Fortnight has like it's Thanos limited time run. I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just have this nice little limited time thing. You have the Titans. It makes people happy, but then I guess the other problem with that. Is that what if it makes it better exactly.	1.0
No, it's the other way around. I think that people in power I interested in spending a lot of money. Yeah. Okay. So they're using they looking for justifications of their own activities. They want to know why is it good what they're doing they want to do anyway see and so why they should text more and why they should they be put into place a monetary. Student that allows for the at-will libitum creation of money and here comes canes and he's not the only one who's one of them and explains them why this is a good thing. So therefore I think they'd hire people of this sword there are constructive. So say if you've got this kind of comments off my back when you apply through you make up a research by for research and and so on and say, okay, so where is this? He's leading us right what kind of policy can we justify with this or help help ameliorate and so on if you say well I probably this doesn't justify anything it if it goes anywhere it probably rather leads to criticizing the whole point of intervening in the first place. Well, then they're no longer interested in finding it because you're not being constructed.	-1.0

So here's a couple things first of all, I don't think you're raising enough.

He's the tech guy he was as you know, he's slams it and it's so I want him to start diving into this but I invest in people and a lot of ways and I worry about your defense ability and a very big way. Okay, but the fact is is that I think you have something truly special in yourself and I see it and I want to be a part of this and so let's take the next step. So right I can't commit a dollar sign until I really do a little bit more due diligence.

Right? So again, like I told you earlier when I first came around went to work for Dawn Kish and and sure if anybody anybody knows anything about bucking bulls and those who've gone to issues and knows what he did for a lot of years and and So I worked around that outfit for a long time and you know, I learned a lot about bulls. I think I learned a lot about bubbles in it and with around a lot of bowls and a lot of cows and lot of All That Jazz. And there was a time when like in the late 90s when I first went around there and early 2000s when if you wanted really good Bulls you need to raise them. I mean, I think everybody would I think you'd be naive to say that in that period of time you needed to raise the goal is to get the kind you wanted that were that were beyond what everybody else had but as we all know through the last 15 years, it's changed, you know, the You know heck there's there's people showing up to those a BBI events that nobody's ever heard of that just flush the cow and put it with this did that and have a mother and had a really good bull, you know, I mean II am not and when I say really good, but I'm not talking about bushwhacker. I'm just saying they have both it turned back in the gate bucket or you know, 22-point Bull and it's somebody that's not really a bull person. They've just bred that way and and and not to try and get and I don't Mean it like this discredit people like they don't know what they're doing. I'm not saying that what I'm saying is it would be no different than me and going and Bryant buying a cutting horse out of highbrow cat and some fancy mayor, you know, I the Bloods there it's in them. So if you know, if you don't as long as you don't mess him up, you know, the Bulls are available and so forth for through just the supply and demand of the rodeo the kind of bulls we Rodeo with week, you know, you guys all know that we don't need both like, you know Long John rodeo with or frozen or whatever, you know, you don't need those but we just need you know, you just need good Bulls to turn back and guy can be 85 or better on and and and so for us what works when my wife Haley and I started Bridwell pro rodeo, you know and and here a couple of years ago. We just found for us. It was more cost effective just to buy the boats, you know with with raising them and that I just don't have the feed for him don't have enough country out here in California Every Little Bit of Country. I get I have to put the horses on because I can't afford to buy the high-end horses, but I can I can I can buy, you know, I have to raise those but I could I can match around and they're really good Bulls, you know, just for free.	1.0

So score was 1:1 towards the end of the first half and Josh something happened in the box there didn't look like it was a ton of contact, but you went down and were down for a while with an injury and I can tell you standing next to You your parents and other people on the sidelines there were some worried people over on the sidelines both one for your health. But also then if you couldn't return that would be a big loss for the team can tell us about what happened there. And yeah, so basically like this kid earlier on the game he went for like a slide tackle and that's when I went down on my shoulder. Like that's when it started to hurt a lot and then later on another kid like hit me in the shoulder and that's when I went down in the box. So so you set off for the rest of the Half did come back in the second half and then I don't know 15 minutes, maybe into the second half you took a shot from just outside the box that the fans over on our side line were ready to cheer and explode in excitement and then it hit the crossbar. So what were you thinking on that chat do you think was going in? I thought I was going to go in because I put like I hit a knuckleball and it was moving and the keeper couldn't do much. I felt bad. Yeah, I was gonna ask you. What was your feeling when it crossbar pretty bad? Yeah. Thankfully we were able to still maintain our composure there and then Auggie you got a penalty kick late in the game there then end up being the game-winner. There were some Chestertown fans and the calvary players and some of their fans to kind of yelling at the keeper trying to give them instructions as to which way you were going to go. Did you hear them at all? What were you thinking when you stepped up to the Penalty spot there?	0.0

Yeah having the having the redeploy. Once again kind of just means you can kind of take your you could take your time. You don't have to worry too much and you can either go to the redeploy or you can go to that thing just to the South which was the overhanging bunker and then boom there's Cascades right there Cascades is the mid-tier and it also has the redeploy right there. So no matter where even if the circle is going all the way down to like Thunderdome like you can really take your time in that area. I think that's what's so enticing about is no matter where the circle is going. You have you have a couple of avenues that you can go you can go to the read a pulley right there, or you can go down to Cascades kind of get a feel like okay. Has anybody been here and regardless you still got that other redeploy. You got a lot to choose from and I think that's that's probably the main reason. It's number one.	1.0
Yeah, this is almost as perfect as it gets and I can almost guarantee. There's going to be craziness on draft night and only Brian gudykunst in his team know who they're looking at and what they're looking for particularly and all we can do is sit here and speculate based off the team needs, but it's fairly how it goes, isn't it? So I can't wait for the draft personally, but if they at they ended up with this kind of Hall addressing so many positions with the value that we got and want Thornhill Debo Samuel Noah fans. I'd be over the moon and I great also folks.	1.0

It was like every call back. It was a smaller group and it was a lot of chi don't remember how many callbacks but I wouldn't be surprised if he was something like 15 called like something out there and then there was like there was like eight of us that they were kind of like trying to put will you to read this role and you read that role and then they had a dinner and I remember my manager at the time she was like, you know, they really hot on this guy 2-pack 2-pack shocker and I was like what you just like whatever you do try to sit next to that guy because they really love love that. And of course as it would play out we sat on opposite ends of the table, you know what I mean, but after we had this dinner and everybody just vibed out and about couple days later.

Well those profound thank you. That really was that changed like that. I've been thinking about that later time again. I'm not always an upstanding citizen the other day saw kid wearing a trump shirt went up to him and said hey asshole dumb fucking shirt, and then I walked away. So like I am not always tolerant like that's that's not to say I'm always a fucking piece love ya person. Like I have my mole of unity respect. Yeah, you know Fleur Fleur life, baby. They'd always the case. But I try as hard as I can and that's all you can do. That's all you can do and again like that comes back to like kind of what I was talking about are just being kind to yourself. You know, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall back. It's okay, but if you're mean to yourself, you're going to sink down deeper into it. So what I used to do when I was in high school. Yeah. I know I'd be like, yeah, I fucking suck. Ooh, I'm going to go do this and then feel worse about myself and be like Oh, my life sucks. I'm like, yeah. Yeah for me. Yeah for me then your victim card gets maxed out and you're like I need to make some changes definitely, you know, there comes a point when you're just like damn it really be all me not all you but like well, no, it didn't a its. It says I don't know. It's just your responsibility to take care of it, but it's not your fault. No exactly. Yeah, because like you it's not your fault that your brain isn't firing neurons correctly and like you don't have enough chemicals. Of Serotonin or dopamine? You can't regulate go green like it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with it a hundred percent. Yeah, because you know, you don't want to be you don't want to be kind of putting out more sadness into the world if that makes sense. Yeah, if humans don't have a way out like if a cell doesn't have a way out it will die. Yeah, like it doesn't have any pores. Yeah, it will like become full of its own waste and die and that's like people if they don't have any Outlets they become I'm full of negativity and they can't Thrive. Yeah, you know really? Well that's where made up ourselves. Yeah, exactly. And so it's like just making those channels to connect with things that you really love isn't really important because if you get in the flow state where you're like, I'm forgetting that time is a thing. I'm forgetting about everything else like when you paint or like stuff like that like that's when You're happy. Yeah when you're going out, yeah, not even happy but just like it was kind of music and yeah concerts and dancing or after something you forget or moshing for a while pockets are the best or they make you remember when they play that one song. Yeah. It's remember that memory and just cried out. Yeah, that's so true. Yeah. A depression is a bitch it can make you think a lot of things that aren't true, but just know that. Your thoughts aren't always real and just note that even though it does not seem like it you have the ability to overcome it. Yeah, it's in you it's in all of it's not gonna happen overnight. Hmm definitely but it can get better and it does get better like speaking as someone in high school who's always thinking about dying. Yeah now I'm 22 almost I don't think about die every day definitely. It's good. Yeah, and if you obviously like this goes without saying almost like if you're feeling these negative thoughts like please tell someone like people want to hear it people would rather hear you complain then hear about you dying a hundred percent. So like there's outlets for that too. Like there's support groups. Like there's so many things you can try like so many things you can try and it's not like It's not like one thing it's not like maybe one thing is going to fix you. Like it's going to be a bunch of different things that you use in your little toolbox exactly to get better. So find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia your straight.

What's on Cops and it's so luckily. God blessed me that night. Oh no, and the woman was like I have a daughter who is also not 21 and does and reminds me of her to a tee. We're gonna call a cab for you guys, but you're going to go to her house. And and he had to prove out lucky. I know right? It could have been some douche mother. But so I know I got in trouble underage, but we'll get into that. So yeah, I mean they called a cab and I got home and like went to bed and woke up in the morning and this is the real kicker. This is where it gets to be like genuinely like and I didn't drink for weeks because of it because I was just so disgusted with myself. I woke up and my foot is stuck to the sheets of my bed, you know, and that's raunchy and I was like don't roughhouse with her. She gets really viable. We got to be easy without okay Elliot easy easy easy slipping into and I ripped the sheets off of me because I was like, what's wrong? And I was in a legit pool of blood and I had no toenail.	-1.0
Associated with that outside of these really like that, you know, not a lot out of body or anything like that, but this is monologue going on in your home. Yeah. It was just I have absolutely no fear of death anymore because I know that death isn't scary, you know, being a parent and being attacked by a shark yet terrifying really but death itself and going on to whatever is next. It's actually quite peaceful and the First thing that I think now is well, the only reason that was was because I had no regrets and I had nothing no thoughts of I should have done this or I should made up with this person. So now it's like, okay. So all I've got to do for next time I die is make sure I feel that exact same way. So now I get to really really live because there is no fear of death. There's no having to hold on to the Mortal coil. I get to be anyone I want to do anything. I want I'm happy and all I have to do is just have no regrets and they loving to everyone and help where I can and now I just really changed the whole direction of my life and my mindset so you're saying is the key to happiness is to just almost died and then live it.	1.0

I don't feel not special anymore, and I've noticed wow like as I'm growing like I am definitely somewhat extra extraordinary in terms of like just my abilities against my peer like or just you know, like around the common people the people at work and just everybody else in my life. I was definitely I stood out like I just had because of my presence because of the fact that my mind is basically silent, you know like you when you're acting on Divine instincts. You naturally are just pretty Next Level and you just always the Right Moves or something, right?	1.0
So there's the typical what people see in the media right that people living on the street that are using hardcore drugs. That's what is all of the TV. So that's what people think that that's where the crisis is, but it's anywhere from The Accidental overdoses from people or first-time users sharing a pill Young. Is trying to get high first first time sharing a fake Dilaudid or something and they accidentally overdose versus just a an elderly patient who may have certain morphine or Dilaudid on board as well other pain medications if they accidentally take too much that still isn't stolen overdose. And if you have a kid, you could still use that to help them come out of it. You have there's there's so many facets to to being able to respond to an emergency and there's could be totally though just those accidental overdoses fentanyl now is in everything. Some people are putting it in in cigarettes and selling them as Cocoa Puffs. So they think it's cocaine mixed in with the tobacco. However, it's actually fentanyl it's fennel. So cheap, right? So they gets caught with everything we're seeing in our area now with one of the the team's I On we're seeing friend all in everything. We're seeing in crystal meth we're seeing in cocaine. We're seeing it in marijuana. So people are just lazy it with it. So you never know what you're getting. So people always argue with us say, oh, it's I get it from my normal guy fickle that street pharmacist. Sorry. It's not gonna be it's not gonna be as as good or as pure as you said, you never know the consistency of it. So when you Consistency. I always go back to one story of you know, two people they want to split a pill they break it in half. The one person takes it he over also the other person takes the other half. He's not going to overdose and the reason is because it's there's no consistency that you can't you can't mix it super well, like I always describe taking a handful of salt throwing it on table take a pinch of salt and so the color Sprinkle it over that and you're going to see a random assortment of different colors specs in nicer cutting that up into piles that one pile might have two specs three specs for aspects that other pile might only had one Speck and depending on where that spec gets put on your side of the pill or whatever wherever you're smoking or injecting. You don't know the consistency of it. So that's why some people overdose harder and go down while harder than others when you you took a picture of	-1.0

It could be a really good player because positioning and that he's got the they've got the football brain. You can say that it's just physically he's it isn't found a little bit wanting still but he's a big boy, and he thought I said I put a bit of size and I'm like the dummy of the pies are never as you look at pictures from when they saw into.

Well it to me, it sounds I didn't hear John William. So I think that strong consideration has to be given to Jonah Williams. Now my consideration there with Williams is that I know that there's not a lot of concerns with him being able to move to the right side, but I think he's best suited as a left tackle. Now a lot of those skills are translatable. However, that doesn't mean every single player can go from one side to the other and Not entirely sure, you know that they want to try and do that. It kind of depends. I I think if they take if they take Williams, I think that that's a that's a luxury pick for them at that point. But how about you go through maybe the top ten that draft network has there that at 12 basically?	1.0
It was so cool. She's just a cool and I think what's important to is that Kate was very open to having Pasha because when you get told Have the new Pro sometimes people are like, whoa! Wait a minute.

So I was glad to see the Dancing with the Stars was something that you were able to yeah, it really is do it was so great because thing was Derek story was my first tour ever and it was hard because it was three months long with the preparation and everything and that meant I had to move to California for just a little bit for the rehearsal period and being that we live in New York not to see him for three months was Only extremely difficult so he did come out and see me like time to time. But of course, it's not the same when you're living together know right away the moment I got Dirk's called to be on this tour Tasha said I don't care what you do. You're not even going to think about you're doing this tour. He's like it's not just for you. It's for us because we want the world to see way more basically ballroom dancing has been seen as all Glitz and glamour, you know, that's and rhinestones and which is great but great hands. Right and at the same time like even in our competitive career whenever we danced Ballroom, it was really more pedestrian type of Ballroom where you get up and you wear jeans and t-shirts and you make it sexy without all the rhinestones which we saw in World of Dance right season 2. Yes, exactly. And that's exactly what we wanted to deliver. So the fact that I was able to kind of go into Derek store and like really fresh out of the competition floor and just do what I love to do and just kind of Be as partner on tour, which was great at the same time. It was just so great for Pasha and his family. So it was it was definitely something I shouldn't have thought twice about but the only reason I did thought think twice about it was just because Pasha was in New York.	1.0
That's a good question for me. I don't know if there's one thing I could point to to say. I'm most proud of I mean, I'm proud of the whole my whole career and and I'm excited about the now and the future, you know, and as my career evolved. I mean, I guess I'm proud that I've pretty much I was able to preserve my Integrity, you know, and you know my for the most part keep my moral compass as a man, you know, and that means something to me, but for me like my career is like pieces of Mosaic like half of it is done. That's the half we talking about another half. It's like it's not there yet because I love it. I love the whole thing. I Fact that I get the opportunity to take care of my family doing what I love to do is supreme blessing.	1.0

That's fine. Just keep in mind a few pointers on one designing practices. Remember to keep explaining to a minimum unless it is a drill or concept which needs clarification and will be used multiple times throughout the season make sure skills practiced relate to any games played or are emphasized during scrimmages. Only start with foundational skills and build your way up. You can see where your players are at a might catch a few mistakes that would go unnoticed if you just jump into more advanced drills. Okay that was chapter for the beginning of your season from coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season. I hope you all enjoyed this longer episode from get the pancake. If you're interested in getting yourself a copy of the full book, which is 10 chapters long and it takes you from your decision to coach all the way up to starting ear to it is available on Amazon both as an e-book and now in paperback. Just because it's on Amazon doesn't mean you can only read it on your Kindle. You can also get the Kindle app for your iPad. But if you are like me and many of the other coaches here the paperback version is great my intention for writing. This book was a to give you a heads-up about what's coming. If it's your first season and be to serve as a reference point for you throughout your season, I recommend you read through the whole book before you begin coaching, but then keep checking back throughout the season because things will come up that you're not expecting or you may forget about it in the beginning of the season and then in the middle of the Season you realize that you need to talk about burnout or something with your players. This book is great. For those of you who are coaching middle school high school or Club volleyball for the first time youth volleyball coaches. You will probably get a lot of value out of the book and if you're hoping to advance into Club coaching Maybe more Elite youth programs. This would be great for you just to give you a heads up as well. There aren't any drills in the book. But if you've ever been to get the pancake.com, you know that you can find a ton of volleyball drills online for free and you don't need to pay for them. Especially if you're just starting out. I hope you are all enjoying your weekend. Thank you so much for listening again to the get the pancake podcast.

Now I have one other thing. I don't know if this is about intuitive eating but this is just about me and I look at it behaviourally in terms of response effort, which response effort is. Exactly what it sounds like your response takes a lot of effort. So like you would always amazed me when we lived together. Like you'd be like filtering your own water system making your own milk to put on top of your like veggie. You're like oats in the morning or like your Chia what puddings I don't even know and I'm like this chick is so not lazy. Like it amazes me is like so like I what do you recommend? Doing because I find a problem also. Why okay, this is I know this isn't maybe not intuitive. I like why it's easier to eat unhealthy for example, or like maybe you're not even listening to yourself intuitively because you're honestly doing what is easier at the moment and like the easy options are like have you ever gone on a road trip and like tried eating healthy along the way it's really like it's like, oh my God, I'm gonna try be healthy. I'm gonna get Plain potato chips right like or I'm gonna get this bar that is essentially filled with so much crap or whatever it is because it's a matter of response effort to like you. I remember actually you want a way with people some words like some music festival or something. We're in Austin and like you packed all this food and like that seems like so much effort to me that I feel like it also does make like I don't know if I'm not necessarily listening to my Intuition or I'm just like doing what's easier.	0.0

Like I yes, I know this feeling I've been this low before I can get out of it and then you know, I'll might eat a potato and now make me feel a bit better and it does it. I don't know. Yeah, it's weird but not as good and you know, like I say and some phenomenal This is one of the ladies I coach Jennifer at. Oh sir. She is 50 years old and she finished. I think I trained her little bit too. Well, I coached in a bit too. Well because she was only like 14 minutes behind me or something. And so thankfully, I mean not that it wouldn't be terrible if she'd beat me but you know, I'm competitive I don't you know, she she did really well and she was wrapped and up the first series. The name of the first woman and then was a lie someone I've never met her before. She probably had me on my half an hour but there's a lady named Sonia Jansen who I'd love to try and get on the podcast if she's listening and she she only had a baby six weeks ago.

No, I agree. He's just really Limited in the coverage and it's one of those things where Taylor rap is a player where you're taking a high floor with a not much higher. Doing so it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Yeah, you're right. He would kind of solidify the position and he wouldn't be bad but he wouldn't be amazing. It would just be solid and I guess that's worth something but that's not what I'm looking for here. This offense needs Playmakers specifically, I would love Deonte Thompson here. I think that that's a good pick I wouldn't be upset at they took Deonte Thompson 44. I think it's great value specifically considering what he does. He's got legitimate concerns about some of the facts facets of his game one Thornhill. Would be a fantastic selection here as well. He's also got legitimate concerns, but I think that he's going to be a solid selection, but I'm looking at Marquis Brown. I know that I know that he does not fit their traditional receiver, but I do think that that could change a little bit this year with Matt LaFleur the home it's tough to get on board with Marquis Brown because of the lisfranc injury and just how small he is but Man, when you turn on the tape, he is electric and it's just so much fun to watch and to think about what he would provide this not only does offense, but the Special Teams unit Depot Samuel is a close second in that department. He didn't he could just do so many different things and Kelvin Harmon is just solid, you know, you're getting a good receiver of Kelvin Harmon. So I'm good with any any of those five.	1.0

I want to do are things that are fast like boxing or you know, or I mean I can't do it as well as I used to like with my health things, but I just effing hate it like I really don't enjoy yoga.

Okay deaf, and Alice is surely now.

So my favorite girls and I'll just like watch them and see the way they move their bodies and get inspired but a lot of my inspiration comes from hip hop dancers and especially people like his funny but like, you know, Casey rice. Yeah, I know keys right here comes Shawn and Casey are she has no idea who I am, but it's okay, but I'm a put it out there in love with the way. She's connected to her body and especially people like I don't really know her like Jade Jade Chenoweth. Yeah, I'm not really familiar with her. But her work is just I love the way. she's like she's committed into what she does wrong and Fierce and Powerful years people like that really inspire me people like Beyonce when she releases those videos and she has like her hair flying like that also inspires me like her Persona inspires me and I want to be like that like that kind of girl in that Ballroom field because a lot of times like you don't really see ballroom dancers out there, you know and feel like I want to inspire people the way these icons Inspire us, you know, like people like I like that Fela or Beyonce.	1.0

You know, it's one of the highest level caliber competitions. It brings out some of the best competitors in the world the best competitors in the World in nogi, grappling and it's a good time for us to watch what they're doing and try to figure out if the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is changing and I know we've done an episode before on The Meta but I'm just going to do a quick review in case you forgot what that is. So the meta is usually short for the metagame and in it means actually two things in game theory in sports the metagame refers to anything outside of the Actual game that influences the game a good example would be like the crowd the crowd is outside the game but depending on their volume level or you know, whether you're on the home team or the away team, the crowd is a part of the metagame that will influence in some intangible, you know, maybe slight ways the outcome or the performance of The Players. So that's sort of one definition in sports in gaming particularly in Competitive Gaming The Meta is something A little different an acronym and it stands for the most effective tactic available. And when people use the term meta or someone is playing on meta with that means is that the professional level players will be using the most effective tactic available because they're professionals and it's very high stakes and you know, they want to win clearly. when me and you practice rolling in the gym we may or may not be on meta which is some of us may have sort of unique games that work well for us, but they wouldn't work well for other people or players and then some of us may not be competitors or maybe we're casual competitors and we have things that work well, but they wouldn't encounter diminishing returns as you got to the highest levels of the game, or maybe they don't even work well at all, you know, there's a lot of And I've certainly been one of them before where I've fallen in love with moves that when I think about it, they were actually fairly low percentage. But those few times that I would hit it. I'd feel really good about myself, you know, something really exotic like a go-go plot or something like that. No offense. If you're a gogoplata player, I just sort of pick something that came to mind. If you ask an average person what the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is right. Now almost all of them would say like locks that we are kind of in this golden age of leg locks. That have started to come to prominence probably more or less in the last 10 years. But really I'd say in the last, you know, three to five years is when it's really really started to accelerate and people are wondering and I'm certainly wondering whether this is a trend that is going to come and go we've seen Trends sort of come and go in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. There was times when the spider guard was a really hot guard or when Marcelo Garcia was tearing it up in the early 2000s. The butterfly guard was Very popular, you know, those things sort of came and went and then there's other things that they sort of they experienced a peak and then they decline but they still stay in the game The Butterfly guards a great example It's Not Dead by any means in fact the rise of leg lock and leg attack positions has given sort of a Resurgence to the butterfly guard because it's a really good entry for some of those bottom leg attack positions. many people very smart people have recently kind of wondered aloud if the leglock craze has reached its peak and if it's going to start declining now, I was watching the BJ Fanatics brown belt Invitational and Gordon Ryan was kind of talking aloud and it was either him or the other commentator that was with him when he was it was Todd and they were basically saying, you know, they were watching these brown belts and someone said, hey, there's not as much leg locks as I thought they would be and I think it was Gordon said well, you know, People are studying the leglock game very closely. They're learning the defenses and they're not as high percentage as they used to be. So there are certainly not going to be going away. But they are just going to become another technique that you have to do and a TCC is a great chance to sort of test that theory because if there's something that's even slightly higher percentage than everything else you can bet that these world class competitors are going to be employing it. So let's talk about some of the things that we might have observed during a a DCC and whether it's going to start something that maybe lower level competitors can take a cue from first thing. I want to talk about was the dominance of guard players and that something we talked about last week, which is a TCC really penalizes you for pulling guard. However, it does not do that in the first half of the match and I should mention while I'm thinking about it. This is something that I wasn't really I didn't make as clear as I should have in the last podcast which I said if you pull guard in a TC you're penalized but that's not really true. You are allowed to pull guard in the first part of a match. It's after the halfway point that you are penalized from pulling guard. And even there there is an exception, which is I believe in overtime if you're in any overtime, then penalties are in play right off the bat. So if you go into an overtime and you sit to guard then you will be penalized. However, in the face of all that it was fascinating to see that there were several competitors that made the calculation that despite being penalized. It was still actually a net gain for them to take a penalty sit in the guard and work their game some notable examples Paul meow took penalties and over time twice, I believe because he wanted to be in guard and it wasn't just him I know meow is you know, he's a very unique person in Brazilian jiu-jitsu with kind of a legendary guard game, but it wasn't just Tenth Planet Phenom Elvira, she said to guard a couple times believe she was injured in that match. So that makes some sensor that might justify why she did outside the rule set, but even beyond that clearly she was a bottom player and even when the matches her matches were in regulation. She was sitting to guard right away Lachlan geils, he would run to the center of the Matteson he would sit in guard and in the high percentage podcast and on the website, we've talked before about how a lot Lot of these competitions atcc is one of them are structured where it's very difficult to accrue points when you're on the bottom, but despite that these competitors have still figured that they would prefer to be on the bottom because they feel like they have the best chance of getting a submission that way. Another thing that makes this impressive is that in a TCC just like in ibjjf the only way you can score points from the bottom is to sweep. However, unlike ibjjf it's much harder to score points on a sweep in 80cc because there is I think there's the to shoulder rule which is in order for someone to be considered down. Both their shoulders have to be touching the mat. I don't think it's quite like that and ibjjf, I believe it's the three second rule and it's What it allows people to do in a TCC is you can have your butt on the ground, but if you can put your hands behind you and get your shoulders off the mat, then you're not really considered down and that makes a huge difference. So people were commenting in the the commentators booth that even to get a sweep is very challenging because you have to really wrestle to get a sweep. So all of that you would think in abstract would make someone really reluctant to play guard especially when you figured that statistically submissions. Are less likely in a DCC. However, some of the very successful competitors this weekend like Laughlin geils for them. It was no question. They sat to guard immediately and started working. So what does that mean with the meta guard players are alive and well, they're not going anywhere at the Sip that the high level at high percentage. We still recommend If you're sort of a newer competitor that you take an approach of getting on top and and pursuing positional dominance so that you can score points. However, if it's no point scenario Then by all means play guard. That's what some of the best people in the world who are doing. And what kind of guards are these players using? Well, there were two guards that really stood out in the weekend. And I remember at one point me and Roy we were on a call together because in real-time to two guys who are trying to watch three mats worth of action, and I said to him men seem like to you like you you're seeing a lot of me Shield half guard and he said absolutely so the one guard that we noticed especially in day one of the tournament was a lot of people were using these Old half guard and and this includes some of its variation. So to get really technical there's the knee shield and then there's the Z guard which is generally like a lower kind of me shield. And then one thing that I noticed with Lachlan and with Craig Jones is that they don't play a close half guard like you would think with if you were like getting a dogfight half guard where you wanted an underhook and getting a dog fight or certainly like a lockdown half guard, which is very very close. They were playing this sort of distance. Eating half guard and the reason especially for Lachlan that he was doing that was he wanted to invert from half Garden to attack like so that was a kind of guard that I really noticed that people that were trying to set up leg attacks. They like that nice Shield half guard also in the women's division. You saw particularly some of Gabby Garcia's opponents opponents were making really good use of that knee Shield, but that was for a different reason. That's because it's a good way to keep large people offer you and this is something I can personally attest to you know rooster wait until And the second big guard that we saw in maybe this was even more dominant than the knee Shield half guard was the butterfly guard. This is sort of the the Gordon Ryan's kind of go to guard lock on geils really liked the butterfly half guard and it's interesting because even within it they have some kind of different takes on it. So, you know Lachlan seemed to go like a lot more knees out. Gordon was more like knees Point towards the ceiling but one thing that Gordon consistently did and I'm not sure why he did this was a lot of times he put his his hand directly behind them and he was on his backhand or he was on his back elbow and other competitors weren't necessarily doing that with her butterfly guard and it's no surprise both Lachlan and Gordon are leg lock guys Gordon has become a lot more well-rounded but you know he's obviously really skilled at leg locks and people that like to go for leg locks should be playing butterfly guard because butterfly guard offers some really good options for getting too eggs inside are even doing inversions which a lot of people were doing this weekend This episode of the podcast is brought to you by anchor FM which is how you're hearing the high percentage podcast right now.

I got to be honest with you. You don't want to look back on your life old and gray and say I could add or I should have taken that one opportunity. That one action that one chance that could have given me a completely different life to move that engine order to build even just the slightest bit of momentum 1 inch is all it takes it's the time in your life where it's do or die. What are you going to do lock into what you want and lock out everything that wants to keep you from getting there but makes you feel happy and fulfilled what lights you up from inside. How do you want to feel as Person, it's the time when you're feeling like you're scraping the bottom of the barrel you're in the dark, but it's up to you to change your perception to shed some light on where you are. It's the time when you're ready to give up. But you know, if you do you'll never be able to live with yourself with the guilt and shame of not pulling yourself out of this state become your biggest support system. You can't keep allowing the lack of support from others to discourage you to the point where you don't take action and you end up giving up. Up on your dreams overnight success of the fantasy but real success is within your reach no matter who you are no matter where you are at in your life right now for you to pull your way back out of where you put yourself in understand it. Was you to put you there. No one else you you are here because of you and you're the only person that can get back out of it. So most people stop but successful entrepreneurs evide Learners and groups and individuals know, The Becoming better as a continuous consistent process not a game where the night sometimes we get too hung up on who doesn't support our Dream, right? My wife doesn't support my dream. My husband doesn't support my dream. My parents don't believe in my dream. Well, let me ask you a very important question. Do you support your dream your gifts your Billings your value? It's about you. You created the pot. You already lined the white and inclusive. It is now easier to identify the things that need to be learned from now you own it. You've heard of the instant success stories the Legends the Trailblazers the Rocks aren't they are the ones we Envy the other ones we want to be the stories. I've heard about people who achieve overnight success. They're just stories. It's a lot sexier to say someone just showed up and success rained down on them, but it's not the truth. There's always a hidden backstory of hard work of A lot of pain no one gets to the top without identifying what success feels like for them without sticking to it for 10 years or more without mastery. If you can't think if you can't bring yourself to move out of your current mental state to one of growth purpose and progress. I want you to follow me. Take a deep inhale. Ask yourself. What you need in your life right now close your eyes and exhale into the vision you have for your life. It's going to allow you to climb back out of the hole that you put yourself in shed light on your current position and be grateful for the experiences that are now about to take place. I'll ask you now. What is above you what's in front of you. You can't go any lower you spiral down as far as you can go. The only Direction now is up. All you have to do is just move that one inch many people won't understand why you're grinding they won't understand why you're attending masterminds and private workshops instead of partying all night long at the club. They're not going to understand that, you know that short-term sacrifices lead to long-term prosperity. Sometimes you need to let go of what you want now to get what you want later, but it's worth it because you're playing the long game success takes time success takes effort. But I promise you that when you finally get there, you'll look back at all of it, and you won't regret a single moment. They will understand that you're building a lifestyle that most people only dream about adding value that will pack the thousands of people and that what you do will leave a legacy long after you're gone from this Earth. They're not going to understand any of that and you know what you shouldn't care if they understand this or not. He's the thing to people can get to the one destination they can get to the same destination. But who's stronger at the end the one who had it easier or the one who started further back who started in a deeper hole who had to overcome more adversity those two people are going to get to the same spot the same destination. One of them is going to be stronger. Your only objective is to lock in on what you truly want for your Life so from now on get rid of the things that are just a distraction if it doesn't fall in alignment with your goals your values the direction you want to go and the place you want to be it is not for you. You need to Define your teeth aim not someone elses. The only way to achieve success without giving up on your happiness is to understand and Define. What is it? Like for you? You got to understand that when you have a vision or a great purpose to add value to the world. This is your journey alone to travel you need to clean yourself to look further than a few months a year. What do you want to do? Do and have at that time. Who do you want to be? How do you want to serve and contribute when you have that vision gets real with yourself and ask what needs to happen now to make that Future Vision my reality. So I take a deep inhale stand up straight lift your chin off your chest pull your shoulders back and start to look in the direction of where you want to go move that each when you get to that. State creating results in your area of expertise is almost effortless. It's an organic process that comes easily to you. Remember the further you spiral down just means the more growth there is on the way back up in the stronger you'll be and you're still waiting around for some kind of signal to finally go hard and give your dreams everything. You got stop seeing it as work ahead of you, but there's only growth ahead of you. There's only That can be had that's it. You can only go up from here and the growth is needed to be where you want to beat. I want you to tell yourself right now that you don't need permission to pursue your dreams. Not my permission not your family's permission not loved ones. Not any expert who rules or anybody else. Never needed anyone else has permission to tap into your greatness. The only kind of success that matters is the kind that lasts if you achieve success only to have it slip through your fingers. All you have then is Disappointment understand that you can't change what you've done wrong, but you can change your perception of it and that's what's going to help you move that inch.	1.0

I guess he let him grow maybe no who just I don't cut them I cut my son's toenails but wife takes care of I don't like talking about toenails skeeves me out. It is gross especially when it's that my son's toenails are really gnarly. Yeah, I just got weirded out.	-1.0

Remember Duran's guys where we talk about one thing from the episode that really grinded our gears and we just really need to Hash it out. Out right here for you guys. You have one I did we did sort of touch on it, but it was Reggie and his storyline. Well bringing his father in I feel like I should be more sensitive about this, but honestly, I'm just like, where is this coming from? It's very left field. And again, like is this just going to go away and then we don't see Mark for like eight episodes and he randomly comes back in.	-1.0
Hi everyone, welcome back to the high percentage podcast. I had a terrifying 20 minutes there because I was having microphone problems and I was like, wow if we don't got a microphone, we don't got a podcast today, but got that worked out. Hey back after a Hiatus last week. We did not upload an episode and an old teacher of mine used to say there's a difference between excuses and reasons and I have reasons for this. Which was I did a DCC play-by-play last weekend. It was great and it was brutal at the same time. It was two days of nothing but watching matches and typing, you know, quick play-by-play summaries on to the computer and then quickly kind of uploading them and getting them refreshed on grappling insider.com on the plus side. We had the most traffic we've ever had in a single weekend. I mean, we really crush it and I think we did the only play-by-play really that I could find on the internet. Yet and I don't know why because it's something that definitely people look for and find Value in so that was fantastic. The downside is as far as I could tell we watched over a hundred Jiu-Jitsu matches and you know, I love Jiu-Jitsu as much as the next guy or girl but that was brutal man way. It was nine hours on Sunday and we didn't finish until the Super fight ended like it probably seven o'clock and I just didn't have it in me. I couldn't talk about Submission grappling anymore. So I took a break but I did post an article about a DCC over the week and that's why I like to talk about today because a TCC is a fantastic time to kind of check in on the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission grappling because it's generally agree that it's one of the top.	1.0
I mean they really I mean if they were going to do it, they really should have passed it off to a girl.	0.0
Well, you should be sending it to people who are more trustworthy. I will get you told me to send it to him my mistake. I didn't know I didn't know he was a sneaky snake. Oh, you did it man.

Well, you know the turning point it what they were quieter, but it was because the show was supporting steric a at that point still and so as soon as bizarre weird Twisted happened just like with the stupid election, they became emboldened and we're like very just going to spread our hey, I do want to talk more about the poses mom thing and of course, you know, there is a bit of sensitivity to the issues since she has passed but I thought that that was so foul. And that's really if anything that got me. Twisted and what steric was actually about it was that because that was dirty on another level when it came to the Scott stands and they're like for them to go to her and then be like, well he say he made death threats against your son never happened and they're just like, why would you tell her that and then of course, she's like, oh who's this whole the wolf person she needs to get along just completely clueless and like okay, Mom. AMA lecture, but it was just so it's just thing that's kind of happening that kind of happened with Megan Tandy that still really upsets me is that like they go to her specifically to turn them against us when it's like we don't have a problem with you.	-1.0
It's this Friday Orion this Friday. Okay.	1.0

It would be boring. I mean, I'd like to say it would be boring.	1.0

Well that might go, you know, you kind of go into these these corporate positions and he's you know, this uniform style. I shouldn't say like physical uniform but right now this is a certain decorum. Yeah. Yeah and you I got I get a little nervous because you know, and I'm you know slightly I have a hard time trusting these types of that atmosphere should be With good reason yes Oven stuff you've been through but I agree man. I we walked down and we got some lunch and and I was like, yeah, this guy's cool. And you told me you had an Emmy and I was like, this guy's really freaking cool.	-1.0
Ding today. Yeah, so do this like the first your head you did? Yeah. I was like me and him of the same like birthday day on the sleeve. Oh, I could put two and two together my dad shot Hoots.	1.0
Now, we've made just thinking like what's the next doesn't like this small thing that was the creek and now it's like sick and they even like added a reason to buy the Galil and Farmers. I think the only thing is the Gloom forms are really sick now like I just played him in mmm where I spent the entirety side only buying khalil's no other Guns and it's $1,800 now sand. It's actually like deals just as good as neikei even better. So so that's a little bit of a problem because it's like $1,000 less. Yeah. I don't know what you do. It's good. Isn't it? Good, right.	1.0
So well, it's been you know initially like in the in the heat of it Josh and then the heat of it like as I'm leaving the pitch back, you know back in Austin. I'm on cloud and Cloud Nine I go through all the steps, you know, it's important for me to be persistent with all investors including James and initially it was tough. If it was very tough because that it felt like a lock when I walked off of the off of the stage. Yeah, and so initially it sucked and worst case scenario of everything bust that we've got a whole lot of other great things going on for us. So we're not you know, I can't I'm not going to dwell on that because I'd still be stuck there and not making the progress we're making right now.	-1.0

Yeah, that's you know what the other thing those two is. I feel like this show does not do Kevin enough justice as I've talked about last week two words, like the you say they've been best friends and that's what the show says and we rarely see them having more than like a scene or two together. And then it's you know, then we go several episodes and then reconnect for a hot second and several more episodes. We never really see them hang out just but there's never a Betty kept storyline there hasn't been an	-1.0

Okay, and they praised they went on record by praising Jay-Z by not know streaming the music on title because of they like no we're not getting anything from it. So so they praised Jay-Z for that too and sucks a snowman. Yeah. It really does artists that can go overseas like you said. Yeah, man, that's that's huge when people like I don't think people know how rewarding it is that when someone that don't even speak the language no every word of your song and appreciate your music. That's crazy. Like a lot of people think that's weird here. Like somebody come over here ramp rapping in French or something like that or Germany, like what the hell is that? Like it's very rare that one of those type of songs pop here in the US. It's been a couple that would like most of the songs is like not even in language, but it's extremely rare for when they hold. Olga celebrated like that. That's that's tremendous. It just goes to show that the rest of the world is like, you know a lot more appreciative of good music than we are here.	1.0
No, I think we should have you all three. That's that's seems to be working at the moment think that Chomp control damage to Citizen. Yeah, remember and then Bennett mess anything up in it.	-1.0
Exactly. Well, that's the one thing I was kind of fearing was like cause you played a bit of the multiplayer to you kind of got you you kind of got them familiar with some of these people who are like Titanfall veterans where they were grappling and then once they got like to a certain speed you basically could just go around the map by sliding and sliding and jumping over and over and never losing speed and every time you do you use the grapple, right? So exactly like I think that would make it pretty hard for Apex just because time to kill is just so much slower in Apex and if someone's moving that fast it might be a little bit difficult true true about it.	1.0
Yeah. So Jeff was like he came to me. He's like I saw that you posted this thing. I'm going to just take a step back and be like, I think you've been off more than you can chew and I think you're going to fail. Well, I appreciate my husband telling me like, I don't think this is a good idea then it was like he put the anxiety in my head of like, whoa, I think you're going to fail so like it was yeah, I'm setting myself up to fail, but I'm already being I'm already failing. So yeah, it was like, I think I'm not going to that. So anyway yesterday girls like Did you start at South both 75? I'm like no. No, didn't you enjoy it? She's like, okay. Just checking. I was just like and then she felt bad because like she thought I was like, right I was like no it's not a big deal. I was just it was it was like a like a gut decision that decision in the moment and I'm like, but that like for me and my lifestyle that I don't think that's a good fit, right? Yeah. I mean for me it's my goal is to get up and to go to the gym every day and feel good about you know, if I wake up and I don't feel right or like my Foot doesn't feel right. Like I don't go like I want to I do it feels good for me that day or if I need a rest day. It's great. And then yeah, um, that's what I do on that kind of a thing. Yes words are hard today. Apparently. What else do you do to help with your anxiety though?	1.0
like some kind of like medical yeah yeah yeah I was getting volunteer hours I was working at a hospital I did also did an Outpatient Center and but were you fine like did you find like enjoyment like no matter how it every time I was I was looking at the clock you know and once I came to the point where I was not present in my work I just told myself why would I like why would I trade that well when I trade my time for money and at least I should be doing something that actually lose myself in like loot like enjoy your work you know they say the three habits of Happiness the first one is journaling take it like you know really increase your awareness of everything that's happening like I'm having my first podcast my two cousins I have the pretty ladies over here you know we're all 26 When We Were Young you're healthy our family's okay like journaling support because it helps increase your gratitude right the second habit of happiness is savoring so when you have a cup of coffee or cup of tea don't just drink	1.0
We agree and I'm so excited for this draft because I don't foresee any more big move from the Packers prior to the draft. I just don't think they have the ammo that they're willing to part with and then also the financial flexibility is a little bit less now that they've kind of, you know revamp the defense through free agency, which is honestly is all going according to my perfect plan for the Packers offseason. And that was to supplement the defense with veteran free agents and then go into the draft and address the off. That's with depth offensive pieces. So I'm very excited for good cuz he can do anything he wants to do, you know, he's going to have to work with patent and the floor to make these decisions and get get this team back to their Championship status.	1.0

I was watching you all's game online at the same time that I was at that game trying to keep up with both games and it was crazy to think because I guess Holly thought they already had The bag and post kind of surprised on him. You guys have been blowing people out my playoffs like if these have been like big wins, like if you guys blow out Stratford, that's gonna be the craziest thing. I know it's gonna be a dogfight.

I think you can it's a noticeable different if you play a lot on client, but yeah in terms of movement stuff, I think it's like so my new and I don't think and maybe this is like a contrarian view. I don't think the right move is to move everything to 128 take like, I don't think that's smart. I think it's like right there.	-1.0

Yeah and you are I mean because it Dave did a very similar sort of thing with me kind of helping helping look at who we are and distill down what we might be good at and help you support us in those ways. And by the way, Like we're not going to just you know be all about Dave and never let you hear from him. Dave will probably on here somewhat regularly. I think yeah, he's got a lot of knowledge is good guy. He's fun to talk to he's gonna be our first guest as me first for our first guest. But so I mean, yeah you like you he hoped to still you down into a DP and then the result of that was you start actually D peeing on the short films that we worked on together, right? You know, it was two weeks after I started by two weeks that we did the 48 Hour film project in Salt Lake two weeks after Drew started and we won and we well we won the audience award which I like for me. Okay, I think the most important like I want to hear more about the audience than judges to be completely honest.	1.0
I think they only did like two seasons. They weren't very for some reason. They were really good show but I'm surprised it only didn't like to season and then they took it off.	1.0
Exactly. Well, I also think that's a common state of behavior. Like we could put this behaviorally into deprivation right when you deprive Yourself as something then how much more do you want to write? Like you're like, I can't be having this now. That's all I want. Right? I mean that's how it works. I mean it's even a simple as like don't think of a pink elephant now don't you want the Pink Elephant the think in your head so like I see how this works. Also. I assume when you're trying to stick to all these diets and like you create these contingencies if I'm only gonna reward myself when I do this for how many days I mean Casey what's one of the I feel like you've done like Whole 30? Yeah. Definitely. I've done probably everything and Whole 30. I actually thought was pretty good to just figure out if you had any sensitivities and I don't know if I'm that is something that you see But like eliminating like the top kind of things from your diet just to see if it does affect you right and then slowly reintroducing it. I like that style. But again, you are you're limiting yourself so you can't have carbs can't have gluten. So then guess what? All you freaking want is a pizza, right? Like you're like, I can't have it like, oh my God right versus that open flexibility or the psychology the psychological flexibility of being like I can have it if I want it does it? Serve my body right now. Is it going to make me feel good? Do I know the consequence of when I eat pizza? I feel sluggish. I may have you know, some Diet, you know some potty issues.

Oh, yeah, which is so great and I just feel like you Have to do it in your own way and if like you're not comfortable taking a nude, please don't feel like I'm forcing you to although one time. We did Force chaplain 2 times the first time but I have always just been a person I grew up in a naked house like that me my mom would was we were always naked like we had a pool we skinny-dipped before bed because like it was just cool our bodies down my moms, like don't even be naked in the shower.	1.0
He's my favorite Bustos pros from the Bustos Pros both of y'all. It's hard now. I think we're I think we're gonna but before we go got any shoutouts, do you want to say hey, hey what you where can people find you?	1.0
And how big how big of an honor is it for you guys to be the last big country team standing now?	1.0
Yeah, so we that's a really great question and you depending on who you ask and Industry you get different answers around that, you know for your commercial guys. They're looking at you know, what can be what could be marginalised in a commercial building. Right? And so that really speaks to things like bathroom pods or you know, anything with a bed really is replicable. So if you think about multifamily product launching even health care hospitals mean one of my clients ones don't The hospital is really just a hotel with Med guess and so it's it's maybe a little bit more complex modularization, but that is really where we think of modularization on the on the commercial side of things on the on the industrial side of things because the downtime is so expensive and an industrial environment. There is a much more incentive to explore off-site construction and push the boundaries of what could really be accomplished through modulars. Ation, and so the modules that you are seeing in the industrial environment are massive large to the extent where some of them can't even be trucked in other being shipped down rivers or up rivers or across oceans, you know from one side of the world to the other massive ships. You're seeing this very very large Mega units modulized units and it's because of the complexity of the work in the preciousness of So time in that industry in oil and gas to wear weeks mean millions of dollars for an operation and if I'll that can be constructed in another facility either in another state on the other side of the globe and be shipped in just in time to be put in place with minimal disruption to operations. That's really the advantage.	1.0

So, you know, what you worried at all after you know, Jewish. I don't even know if they said because you were so young. If this evening entered your mind said that were you concerned that you might get Typecast because as you mentioned if you think about juice in the context of everything else being made at that point, I mean, this is 1992, right? So you got boys in the hood you got mrs. Society, so discussing black trauma and putting black trauma on That way was a big thing. It became a cottage industry where you ever concerned that this is this is who are all of who Hollywood is just going to see you as no, I was never concerned about that because probably to your point because I was too young too, but I was never concerned about it.	1.0

Great. And like the reason that number goes back or the reason, you know, your weight comes back. And in fact, there are studies that show that in only like less than five percent of people can sustain intentional weight loss after a period of dieting meaning that 95% of the time and after a period of one to three years post diet you're going to gain that weight back and the reason why is because your body wants to be at a state of homeostasis, which means that it's keeping things at you know, your your internal set point of what is a normal and healthy weight for you and that number is different for different people based off of your Or metabolism your genes your culture so many lifestyle factors. So it's not that simple to just think. Oh, I you know, I'm going to go on a diet. I'm going to lose this weight and it's just going to stay off your body has so many complex mechanisms and Pathways to actually restore that weight that it wants you to be at and there's a reason it wants you to be at that weight and that weight is different person to person. So, you know, if you think that just adopting your favorite like And influencers diet and nutrition and fitness habits is going to allow you to have that person's body. It's just not because you have a completely different DNA blueprint than them.	-1.0
