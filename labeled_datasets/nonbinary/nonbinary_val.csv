Did you play how much traveling are we going to do? How do you decide playing time? What uniforms are we getting? Can you give my daughter a ride when our practice is going to be? How do you think will do this year? Try to address as many of these questions as you can in your introduction to the team the fewer questions. There are the quicker everyone will get out of the meeting which busy parents appreciate additionally. If you answer some of these questions up front like how long have you been coaching? It will feel less like you're hiding things and you will see much more confident and trustworthy do your research have your ducks in a row and lay it all out on the table a sample introduction for a first-year coach could sound like this. Hello everyone. My name is Whitney Bartok. And this is my first year coaching volleyball. Although I'm new to coaching. I started playing volleyball when I was in sixth grade and have been playing ever since while in high school. I worked at every summer camp and even LED Camp my senior year. What I loved about coaching during Camp was seeing the girls develop their skills and watching their enthusiasm for the Game grow. Although it's my first year coaching. I know that this program has been very successful in the past. I plan to build on those successes with an aggressive playing style which still develops the Er Team you should then go over team rules which is detailed in subsequent sections established travel plans the possibility for any additional travel uniform ordering if not already in place practice schedules and team policies. Once your presentation is done open the floor for questions. You should have addressed most of the topics which apply to everyone so you may get individual questions at this point note that you can discuss individual questions afterwards, so the group can be dismissed. If you do not already have it have sheets, which families can complete and pass around at the meeting for contact information follow the meeting up with an email summarizing your points and reiterating any questions, which you answer during the meeting one final note. Although I often refer to family members as parents throughout these Pages Please be aware that sometimes you may be communicating with Aunts Uncles grandparents legal Guardians step parents cousins. The list goes on and on I And being inclusive in your speech because not everyone will have a mom and dad as their primary support system. I prefer to use the term family as often as possible since this has always captured everyone who is a legal guardian for my girls. So despite my use of the term parents on occasion. Please note the family structure for your players before you say anything which exclude someone who cares for one of your girls more paperwork. I know I know you thought you were done with paperwork, but I have good news for you.	1.0

I do tend to Take longer than I want to but takers as quick or as long as you need for these questions and I will try not to interrupt or drawn out any longer than it needs to. Alright. So the first one is how has a failure or an apparent failure at the time set you up for a later success.	0.0

Yeah, that kid was fucking annoying when he was growing up. They had me one time. Pre-preschool, we don't know why we were in a room that was like a part of like it like shared a building with someone and they took us to a room and a room bunch of kids. He's guys here. You killed him.	-1.0
So let's talk about the secondary this legitimate and secondary part of this episode, which is the whole Jackson and his girl car quote-unquote girl car thing. Yeah. I hated that. Yeah. I'm not sure if I was the only one and it's funny because I haven't watched these episodes in a long time because when I do re-watch Hannah Montana It's usually the later Seasons. I felt like they I don't know. I just there's a lot of stuff that happened in Even this episode not only this episode but also the episode that we all the second episode we watched the didn't seem like it's a good well. Yeah it really didn't. Yeah.	-1.0
Well first of all, it's Christmas trees in England are the grossest things you've ever they're like the most anemic. There's like a literally a branch and then there's tree.	-1.0

Let me just like rattle off a list of things that God changed. Okay, they buffed the farmers and Galil spray. So the spray is tighter. It's not this different pattern what I didn't know that far. Thomas is $2,000. The glial is $1,800. They're both $200 off on sale special. Whoa, then they added a 16 weeks pass where you can unlock different price tiers kind of like Fortnight the exact same way they set up battle pass in Fortnight, which is just a good system. It's just extra content free cases and stuff like that. Then they added skins for the models in your game. So they added all like different like kind of better looking models to the game. And even though the game's first person they So added a screen at the end that gives you accolades for different things that you did best during the game. So if you had like a highest ATR most headshots or whatever you'll all be on display for your team to see and then they will show you liked what you were actually best at so like utility damage or Flash assists or ADR and then you get there. There's where you get to see the the Skins as well. I'm trying not to reach out right now and then they also added three new cases for new knife skins. Or for new knives with all of the same all the skins and then they added new map to scrimmage mapped as was is just made by like a community mapper. They had a like some Scouts knives math.	1.0
On any format that you could hear our podcast it is either it's either in Spotify iTunes and make sure you follow us our page in Facebook and Instagram social media is really I think that's it for now guys.	1.0
audience is seeing it and you want to give them the same show that you guys kicked off a month before two months before and it was great because the people in the show were so great and it was such a small cast. I think it was only eight of us all together including Derek. So it was such a good intimate cast that it felt like such a small little family traveling America together. It was so cool. It was just always uplifting. We never had drama like it was just always super that's helpful to Super positive. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah. Okay.	0.0
I was just trying to look I try to remember when Max Scherzer signed his deal because in my mind, I was thinking it with with the Tigers. He didn't truly become really special until late into into his Tigers career who's kind of League average me a little bit better picture up until but very durable very durable true and that was part of Of his Allure, especially when he really took off in 2013. That was his first 200 Innings season. He puts it together another one with the Tigers in 2014. So he had put together back-to-back season was where he looked like a front of the rotation guy at 200 Innings, but he had done that at the age of 29. So he and his free agency entering his age 30 season. That's a lot different than another 2 years beyond that I'm saying for Clevenger. Maybe maybe he builds himself up to to that. sort of level consistent But as you said you would be risking it more as a team at the age of 32 and there are already people that were a little bit nervous I guess is the best way I can put it about the deal that Scherzer sign with the Nationals. And again, he did that entering his age 30 season. So that's a little bit of a different situation but that was a little bit surprising that to me sounded like the Indians rolling through all these names in the Dodger said, oh well, if you're going to roll through all these guys that you like we also would like to make a Of it at Clevenger and then the Indians being the Indians a team that is just there not going to hang up or in this case walk out the door. Just based on you bringing up a name. They'll say okay. Let's talk Clevenger. This is what are realistic thought is on him and they would discuss him and even by the Indians entertaining it just to say we would expect you to give up this completely unobtainable amount of talent in return for Clevenger. You've now quote unquote discussed it. No, I'm not we're not we're not sitting in there. I don't know how as you said I don't know how aggressive these talks actually work. But to me discussing it means that the Indians entertain almost anything and if the fact is that they spent four or five minutes talking about it. They have already discussed it and then at that point leaking that sort of report is factual you did discuss adding my Clevenger to it, but it was completely and totally off the table in terms of reality. That's just the way that I interpret it well and they always	-1.0

So for this year, so to make sense, however, some of them they do that and like it makes it just opens because they open a lot of the older episodes like that. Yeah, like as I remember I could be definitely wrong. Yeah. I haven't watched any of like the first season a long time.	-1.0
It's a fucking party. You don't when you're with us this this fucking place gets late. We are the party. Yeah, like I don't know about you guys if you go with I changed it. Don't worry.	1.0
It's that's been a new occurrence though.	0.0
All right, let's go thank some good Insight now you ask your next question today. Alright, so the next question. Is what are two things you would tell yourself in your 20 when you are 20 years old and your early 20s.	1.0
No, I agree with you. And so let's go with it. Brian Burns who again is my draft Crush. So I trust you with Brian Burns again long athletic. He was a productive player at Florida State and he all he does is make plays he can really get after the quarterback. And as we as we've seen from tape with the Chiefs and what Mike Smith likes to do with the outside linebackers, he will get that football. He will get a lot of strip sacks and that is built exactly for what the Packers can do. So as we move to pick 30, so kind of recapping what happened. After Brian Burns was taken by Green Bay and 12 Drew lock goes to Miami at 13 Christian Wilkins to the Falcons DK Medcalf to Washington Jonah Williams to the Panthers replace Matt Khalil a Cleveland Pharrell to the Giants Dalton Reisner to the Vikings. That's gonna hurt Ross Cody Ford to the Titans Devin Bush to the Steelers greedy Williams to Seattle. That's a really good fit there Camille Harry your Arizona State boy to Baltimore Garrett Bradbury to Didn't Josh Jacobs to the Raiders Chauncey Gardiner Johnson the safety from Florida to the Eagles Hakeem Butler to the Colts TJ Hawkinson goes to the Raiders at 27 Byron Murphy cornerback from Washington to the LA Chargers and Mack Wilson from Alabama to the Chiefs. There's a normal name that I didn't just read and I think we're going to take him a 13. That's probably no offense.	1.0
All right, so we got past that bullshit laundry and dishes neither of them ever end. No ever they don't laundry Nate.	-1.0
Right and I felt like oh my gosh, I no longer have this negative burden, right? So that was cool. And then so I and then in 2016 as many of you know, I had that deep experience where so this is a few months later after that. I had this deep experience where I became president. I became really present and my mind stopped and I This deep peace. I achieved this realization of self. I realized I am. Not my mind. I understood that I was I was Consciousness and beyond that once you realize that you are liberated.	1.0
Well like not cool.	-1.0
Two other siblings. I don't know where the fuck they were. My dad opens the blinds. He's like murder. Is that a corn dog stand? He's like yo, yo, you want a corn dog? I like yeah, so we go down there and get one and that's that's when I blank I don't remember anything else. All right ready? I got the corn dog, but that's why people story of getting a fucking corn dog or a hot dog, like peoples it ready. I can Mexican this story up. This is happened to me we go to Mexico, right? We spend like two three weeks. If we get a cold not all know, I'm not gonna finish we're at the border, right? It's long as I cuz people immigration.	1.0
Okay, so that's very strange what the new tradition that we have. I'll call it new because I think we my parents used to put up an honor not a live tree, but fake tree.	-1.0
I think this kind of weaves into a lot of things that we've talked about today. We work with hundreds of contractors every year and we see the whip statements see the balance sheets. You see the income statements and otherwise good or excellent year for a contractor can be wiped out by one or two bad projects. And if you wind the tape back on those one or two bad projects there was probably a lot of warning signals that happened during the pursuit phase as to it was a project larger than we've ever built. Or was a new owner that we've never worked with or gosh at a time. We didn't think we quite had the team to do it and she's like a culmination of a lot of those factors that result in a really bad project and for contractors projects from my margin standpoint for my project Sim profit standpoint can go marginally better, but they can go infinitely worse. And if I had a megaphone to speak to the construction industry would be to really hone in. In on Project selectivity particularly now at the top of the market cycle when there's more opportunity than there has been in recent years and contractors. I think have I will say the luxury of being more selective being more intentional about the types of work that they take on what Tyler thanks for being with us today. Thank you. It's been a pleasure.	1.0
Here's what were yours? Right? Let's see.	0.0
Wow. She's really cool. Yeah, that's it. You actually have that camera, right? I do. Yeah, that's so cool.	1.0
Well, you live out here. I was like, yeah, I kind of like both. Okay. Alright, you like a loli. But anyway, thank you. Good luck with everything Omar's getting out of here, but I'm still sticking around one more segment to go. Y'all know what's coming people fucking I'm bothered. When I was in high school, my mother told me she had one goal for me to make sure I made it out of high school without getting pregnant. Now. My mother had me when she was 18 years old. So she was coming from a perspective of having truly been there and done that. I like a lot of other young women. I got the usual speech about sex keep your legs closed, but she also put me on birth control pills when I Fifteen or sixteen years old. She taught me how to properly put on a condom. She talked to me very openly about sex point. Is she army with the information she felt like I needed in order to make informed decisions about my own body. Now young people in sex is always going to be a polarizing emotional topic. And so I understand why everybody lost their shit when TI who was one of my first podcast guest said during a podcast interview recently that he went to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. And when she was in high school to quote check her hymen, in other words to ensure she was still a virgin the backlash was immediate Swift severe and intense but T. I also received a lot of support from both men and women for what he said now before diving into the reaction a few things need to be cleared up in the aftermath TI and Tiny who appeared on red table talk, which is hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith and her mother they told their side of the story T. I explained that he was joking. King and embellishing he did not go to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. He explained he did accompany his daughter and Tiny to the gynecologist once and it was mostly happenstance. He said he has never been in the examination room with his daughter and when he was at the gynecologist, she welcomed his presence but here's an excerpt from that conversation on red table talk.	1.0

We're opening like literally we had our first seminar meeting last week and we discussed our opening for an hour of how we're going to make this sound. We always have this opening session ceremony will be posting those pictures as she I took some level actually posting. Usually something we blow something up like to me on fire it just to get everyone pumped. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
Wild and blue? Yeah. Yeah. She's been every year since so I actually bought her from the guy here and right here outside of town a friend of mine named Chuck Norris. He raised he raised his bucking horses and does some high school college and it's Amateur rodeos and has a brief program himself and and I actually bought two members from him and I'm kind of think that year. I bought those murder. I'm gonna say I think I bought those mares from him and like, oh, wait right in there and and I bought wild and blue who herself, you know bucks bucks. Obviously really? Well, she'd been to the NF are all these years and then there was another mare that came with her and her name was His Indian summer. Well Indian summer, she's just an okay Bronk. But remember when I was talking about that consistency of being really solid she oh one of those kind she's solid. She's like a 1920 pointer every time and she her oldest cult I have is a bronc named Indian burn and I took him we've taken him to the finals the last two years. He went as a four-year-old and five-year-old. So and And I know you're playing with fire taking a four-year-old to the National Finals. But but he's just that good and anyway, so that that purchase worked out pretty good for us by an electric bears from Chuck. So, you know, we got a boy, you know a really good mare that produces Colton and one that bucks really well herself. So yeah, that's about what they sometimes it hits like that. Now I've got other stories I could tell you that didn't hit very good that one did so so kind of transition into the to the Bulls	1.0

So if you have clutter get that dealt with so that you can kind of isolate the mess down to just dishes if you have dishes to do You're going to want to put away clean dishes. Maybe you have a drying rack that you need to empty, or maybe you need to empty your dishwasher. And put those things away and if you don't have any dishes to do, you know while I'm talking about dishes just get right into the deep cleaning of your kitchen because some days if you've been, you know cleaning as you go doing dishes after meals, you might not have a messy kitchen. So if that's you this would be a great day to just deep clean your surfaces like, you know, maybe even the inside of your microwave the inside of your fridge.	-1.0
It's all very similar. But the difference is you guys have Specialists. Sorry, there's a department specifically working or H sort of thing that we do so you have salvaged and repair unit that works with the tools and uses the helmets. Then you have an underwater bomb disposal unit. Then you have the Tactical operations team. Then you have the land-based EOD whereas we don't have as much as many people as you and so the current starters we have to do all of that. So it's an interesting but it's hard to remember a lot of stuff. So it was really cool to just come out and meet with everyone and I made lifelong friends from that trip. Any one of those guys is my best friend to this day and the water spins the opposite way, correct? Yeah, exactly. You know, I kind of fell in love with it and America has this really romantic sort of feel for Australians because we all grow up watching. It on TV and in the movies, and and so when I got the opportunity to come out here all a jumped on it and I love living out this see that's how we feel about our show you is that we have very romanticized absolutely.	1.0
Yeah good back then. I mean that was the only way that you were really going to pop and you know as a young kid, especially given your situation, you know, you wanted to just signed a deal you wanted to get that money. So you just did it unknowingly, you know, these kids don't know anything about business. So there's how it is like the labels were literally just taking advantage of all these kids that just wanted to put out some music and I wanted to be famous and get some money.	-1.0
Isn't this episode's sponsored by two guys in a hot tub by feet away because in that ye dudes don't be aware of it. Laughs. Yeah, we couldn't get over it. Ha ha ha and instantly the podcast is like because it's like more natural in the podcast. I had boys who's going first to new stuff from last week.

His face was so funny. Yeah, and I was just like, yeah, I can't write anything down about this because it's just too funny.	1.0
Usually I wipe them down after I use them. But sometimes you're just on a roll wiping things down and you'll wipe down your small appliances to but remember when I talk about bonus chores in the kitchen, those are not for days when you're very overwhelmed.

So hopefully that will be launched soon and I guess going back to my be the overall online store idea because I've seen other ones where similar sort of things but bedroom packs around the furniture more than just the the kind of the lighter or the smaller pieces and look. I don't have any experience at all. But my initial response to when I see those is I'm a little Little about how well they would actually do not because it's about I think it's a great idea, but I often wonder what I look at those, you know, some of the prices for the full living room pack or Furniture whether there's actually much demand out there and and given that there's actually a lot of competition as you say retail is can is struggling on this at the moment. I imagine that's the case online as well and I guess it in an of a selfish it could be a time business, but it's kind of sitting as a second priority to for the most of These staging businesses as a second or complementary part of their business. So I guess I'm just wondering if somebody has no idea at all how well these things are near you've just said that you just received quite well. Have you found that it's something that buyers are all I guess. What do you think about others who are doing similar sort of things but in a Furniture space, do you think that they're actually going to be something that given our industry? It's actually received were Lords in demand or or my kind of missing the point a bit.	1.0
Like I can't wait to hear about how you guys are growing like how you guys have transform how you guys used to feel negative all the time just like me and now you're feeling amazing all the time and people can't believe it and people think you're just like going crazy or something, but you're just feeling amazing and people think Bob la like but know you've you've made it you raise your vibration and like you Lies wow is really simple feeling good is my Birthright. It's how I'm meant to be. I meant to feel well. And then when you share this with your friends, you're going to sound crazy. They're going to be like, yeah, he's making it up.	1.0
Oh my God. I cannot wait for you guys to see it.	1.0

Well when I was still in school, I used to play basketball, but not really a varsity level is like pickup game stuff.	0.0
Totally. Yeah, and so what happens and it's interesting that you know, you all speak so much about like deprivation and I'm curious to hear the connection. But like when you when you go through that process of whether it's fasting or just restricting your calories in some way even if you don't think you're restricting your calories, but to your body like your body doesn't actually know if that's intentional that you're on a diet or you're trying out some new fasting Trend or if you're literally like experiencing food insecurity or a famine. So on the weekend as soon as you are around abundance with Food or as soon as you like loosen the reins on the tight grip of your eating habits, your body is also kicking up your Cravings your hunger hormones your metabolism to try to compensate for that missed caloric energy that you missed out on. So again, it's like it's not even Something That We're consciously doing but as soon as your body believes that you're that you have access to food again, it will send you into overdrive to try to make up for that loss.	-1.0
Moving it out. Yeah daggers into yeah just know we've had some where we were shocked.	-1.0
Wait, well, the funny thing is in the periphery you have I mean everywhere you have the same type of problem Google department and greater region inequality. Right? But in the periphery these problems are stronger, especially the redistribution problem at the if you look at people initially the upper class in Italy. There is a greater difference between them and the lower classes in in Germany. Hmm. Or in Spain or Portugal and so on so probably all right. The problems should explode in the periphery and there's an exploding for free as you know that Greece Spain is very particular. I'm very iterative of Spain right there all the way through this crisis. There is a lot of coverage but then the society it's definitely not something they literally went through things that the Greeks for instance did not would not tolerate the silent could say the same for our the Irish.	-1.0
Yeah, I mean small businesses tough enough. So I think you'd be keep it as simple as that then it can be I feel like it's achievable.	1.0
A lot of people did Pickens. I'll give ya Tommy you're not wrong, but he wasn't. It's strange to see what people think of decade is because they were picking like Matt Murray and people like someone had Kevin was scattered Steve more exact dude.	-1.0

John Singleton, John is He was he was super intense. Good good dude fun, you know, but he was really meticulous. That's the one thing. I remember about John like everything had a purpose every single thing on the set. The way the setting was everything had a purpose for him because he was into the he was like a genius Storyteller. So it wasn't just the words coming out of your mouth is what you have on is what's the picture on the wall? wall behind you when you're saying this line and and it was um, it was an intense set and it's really interesting how that was another set where we you can you can this certain projects with it feels bigger than the parts like we're saying something profound here this thing and you could feel that permeating through this set, you know Cube doing his thing and and Jennifer Connelly doing her three Kristy Swanson, but You never know like you look back on high alert and now and it's like sighs like prophetic, you know, you can't really know that in the moment, but I just think you know, that's a testament to his storytelling and you know, he picked he was talking about Universal things and and Timeless things that are unique to the American Experience.	1.0
Well, they weren't going to pin her against Latrice.	-1.0
Ideas that that's what we should like to yeah, and and you know, I do believe that there are people out there who are experts in nutrition and you know these different Medical paradigms, but somebody having a lot of Instagram followers does not necessarily mean that they know what's best for your body.	-1.0
So I like to use a bar of soap in the bathroom that I can. So use on my face and then of course your guests want the soap to come from a pump. So in the kids bathroom / guest bathroom, you know, it's a hand soap pump and sometimes there's also a bar there if you know one of the kids wash their face in the sink, but for the most part they do that in the shower. So I tend to wash my face in the sink on some mornings. So I like to have that there and my husband doesn't seem to mind using a bar of soap in his sink either and I feel like it's a little bit cheaper. So when I mentioned soap dishes that's more in the master bathroom, or maybe it's for someone in your hall bathroom to wash their face with but I do recommend having a pump for guests to wash their hands with when they use the restroom.	1.0
Yeah. And I know you mentioned like there are things we can start doing now and that's really it just just beat that example. I do want to say as we gear up towards yellow days not until May right but Deedee you said it best like why wait till then start some things now and I think we've covered quite a few things my favorite part about this kind of talk to is that when I do this talk or this this conversation as a keynote when I go out and speak to schools. My favorite part is just seeing people now their heads, you know, like yeah. Yeah, that's a great act. Like I already do that and that sincerely that's my hope that These are things people are already doing maybe that's just reignites your idea that come across has try that or maybe I can do this for my students know really busy in the classroom.	1.0
She also does really have anyone watching her though. So she kind of like lives alone, you know, so I think it gives them a little freedom to maybe keep a dead.	1.0
There's a there's this book and it's basically like he talks about the value of live like of like sub like, it's not just live it's live and you are part of the content as a viewer. I think that's something really unique that only exist but we had on screen.	1.0

Oh my gosh, I I actually have a blank on this one. I think maybe two sides of the coin from a client's perspective. This may not be answering your question directly Jake but from a client perspective their perception of home staging it could be quite an expensive investment or them and they might not want to spend that money to Stage a home to sell but then on the flip side. The home stages I guess wanting to come into the industry that it isn't there is so much more Blood Sweat and Tears involved in in home staging then just, you know, making a bed and fluffing pillows. Yeah, there's so much more involved. I think that's probably all I can give you at them.	0.0
This isn't working. I'm thinking but again I'm able to apply that knowledge that I'm learning those stories from people. I'm kind of starting to know more people in the industry and then I do freelance for probably two years things get a little bit slow and that's when I A call from Dave attics participating Dave mopper. That's what and that's and I actually met Dave at Redmond.	-1.0

Next one number seven is Skull town which from the map. I'm actually surprised that it's not a purple Landing Zone. I could have swore. The purple zone right think they drop their like it's an orange Zone. Yeah, and I think and I think we talked a little bit beforehand, but I think one of the main reasons why it is such a good drop zone. Is that even though it might not have the best quality gear? It has the most quantity of gear. So you might not get you might not get your purple armor. You might not find like an orange helmet, but you will get a lot of it. So if you do find Shield cores, you're going to find a lot of them. You're going to find a lot of Medics you're going to find some gun and a good amount of ammo and then kind of like our one story about how we got down in this skull town, you know, if you're able to survive that encounter, you can have like a lot to choose from you can have up to like, you know anywhere from 15 to 20 death boxes should be like, what do I want? Oh, this guy had this I'm just going to pick that up that there.	1.0

Okay, like I shouldn't be having to like take shots of a smoothie to try gulp it down. Right? Like I and I just feel like these behaviors are essentially just reinforced or like doing these certain things or reinforce even by like seeing someone get so many likes on Instagram about it.

I presume the vocals in the production, but obviously takes a long time to make sure to get all the samples clear that they have mix and master everything. So again, it's a process. I know that you know as Fans of dreamville. I wanted you know the stuff to come out a little bit earlier when they first announced it but under their realistically I wasn't going to happen. I was trying to say like the end of February but obviously going to take a longer time in that but he was just talking to some fans the other day and he did not like directly confirm that it's going to come out in April what this is just what he is hoping that the album will come off revenge of the dreamers. Meanwhile, we've been trying to make sure they and the dreamers 3 is done and then put it on video. So the middle child videos now and of course he was at all-star weekend. He performed and participated in the in the dunk contest as well helping out not some people so it's cool man, but I'll open it.

That was very by far and the I don't know what happened. But the tape was just trashed like I'd put it into like the other capture at real-time weird. Yeah, you gotta play it on TV. You have to walk away. Yeah as it's going through the acts like if it's an hour of Tapley, you have to wait for an hour for to go into the computer. Yeah and like you want to talk about I do not miss that. Oh boy me neither man. So the I mean the biggest sinking feeling in the world is realizing have to Talk to the client and say hey, I lost your wedding. Sorry luckily in this case in this particular case. I was very lucky and and they were actually very very cool. And I think we saw I think we had a second camera but in no audio is like we could see it was sort of Salvage but like not really kind of my me so, okay. So anyway, so after after doing wedding videos, I'll speed this up because actually we are cruising on time the first three minutes of this was was us trying to record. Oh, that's a good point.

So like I've I love yoga. I also tend to not go to yoga when I have shit going on in my life that I don't want to face. Like I know when I go to yoga, I'm gonna have to like sit with myself and you know, I you know, and then I will instead when I'm you know, experiencing more stress or whatever. I might fill my time. With other things or in a cycle class where they're yelling at you I get it. You're so great Kick-Ass versus in yoga where it's like you're going to maybe you're gonna breathe here in this like pose for five, you know deep breaths and like maybe that's it. I mean, I know I don't make time for things like when my Apple watch goes off and tells me to breathe.

You know, it's just nice. That's like a really kind of like that's like a kind of very cordial handshake right where it is. Yeah. Everyone was just trying to have fun. That's what that is the point of the game, you know, when people I do like when people are like they know sometimes it goes too far with like I ice beside ins streams and stuff like that, but when people are like, oh it's content its content like everybody is so aware. Yeah what that is almost sickening but like at least it's better than people not being aware and buying into Something that they don't understand it's kind of cool that if you'd like people are I remember like when he's first started it like watching YouTube your favorite YouTubers couldn't have a fucking sponsor without everyone calling them fucking sellouts or Yeah by trying to dissuade them. Tell them they're unsubscribe and shit like that. And now people understand the plights of the guys were probably make it like millions of dollars more than like their parents do they'll be like no he's just got to do this right? He's just this is important. How is he going to make a living if he doesn't take on a Sir, we have to be supportive like all that stuff. That's the kind of rhetoric.

I probably the sweetest hot spot.	1.0

So I guess there is a good part to the story. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm just looking at my notes and I had a couple different stories and I just looked at this and there was a time where I fell asleep in one of my best friend's driveways in high school. But other than that that was a whole other story, but we're not going to get into that. But yeah, so I'm like crying to this cop and they like clearly tell that I am struggling and so as I know from this point is that I have a drinking ticket and when you go to drinking ticket, I think you need to Like 30 days until they call you because you need to like go to these classes so you can like you like path I be in a yes at 16 years old. No, but listen to what happened, I actually got pretty lucky. So they're supposed to call within 30 days. And if they don't call you, then you're like off the hook. They like forget about you. So that's what happens me. But if they did call me I would have had to do all these classes. I would have had to pay like a huge fine, but they never called me. Oh my god. So let's assume I'm fine. There's bigger and better things to conquer. I know I think I like Even Lee was like people doing heroin. Oh, yeah, and I was just like drunk off of two bears at 16. Like I was fine. Yeah. I feel like in high school like drunkenness was very different than drunkenness in college. Like I got hammered and lost my toenail and didn't remember. Yeah, but for me a school without it happen, I would have seemed very much remembered. Yo, I don't know my high school was pretty like it's funny because I got into a relationship with Cody the my freshman year of College so like I'm not trying to saying this like lame in college because I wasn't like I still want out and shit but in high school like I think like I don't know our fucking high school was pretty wild like I had some of my wildest times in high school, but also in college, so I think it's like pretty definitely I would say training College. Yeah. No, I think I hit it early in high school for sure, but I do think like equally I've had just this crazy times in college then I didn't High School. I had to get my eggs for me in high school was like a thing thing. Like I was smoked I was so against weed for the long. I don't think I had like my first oh my God, my first so bad like blonde or whatever J anything until Earth smoked out of a bowl. So I was in like 11th grade I used to but I got drunk guy in like seventh grade. So I used to go to my car on my lunch break when I was in high school and literally roll a joint and walk in. Oh, yeah our like history and just like Oh, yeah of weed and no one would ever say anything because they were scared my like whole high school did that was so bad. So we have one quick interview today.	1.0
At the time I had this like very innocent idea what was going on that these were just kind of like fan moments given like spread out throughout the show just to be like, oh we see the kind of like things that we see you, but obviously we're gonna go there but now that I'm looking back on it. It just looks like they put in those moments to string us along. Yeah, but it worked enough that some people were strongly strung along enough that they went to the end.	-1.0

So I set up a coffee station in the formal dining room, which was perfect because in that house when you first walked in your in a foyer area with a piano in a bookcase, that's when my kids would make a mess with the bookcase, but I hadn't really thought that through and it looked nice there.	-1.0

Yeah, and I mean, it's just I feel like another reason is I've dropped there so many times now there and there and like the wetlands and things like that. I've dropped so much that I'm so used to the layout of it. I feel like I have that that first like hot Drop if I was going to hard drive anywhere it would be there and then obviously number one but it's like those are the places that I'm so comfortable with that. I feel like I know the angles I know the corners and I really I just like the setup of it and then if you get in a pinch using that zip line across the tooth, you know the to He's or whatever is really nice because you hit somebody just right.	1.0

Yes it is. It's true. But then so once you're through this and the last quarter of the book, then he presents over this intellectual digest out of this right what came out of this and it's really a very positive life-affirming surprising. astonishing comforting comforting View and philosophy is all you on the other problem problem of suffering and what I love most is this ways that while we need to think of the meaning of life in the copernican turn like we need to think the way we are thinking about this because the way Buddhist would think of it and many other people is well with you need to look inside right and goes look for the meaning of life in Our own soul the belly or wherever and then try to realize yourself right go out and then transform the world according to the meaning that you find in yourself and he says it's exactly the other way around you need to look at the world around you and see what challenges it poses to you. And that's where you will find the meaning. That's where you find. The the starting point for Meaningful life is just astonishing it's great.	1.0

That's my point to reinforce that point someone who's just had the catalytic converter stolen from my car because of the the epidemic of thefts that are going on at the moment. Yeah.

Can I say you can take you got your good girl, you're fine saying kick ass, and there's no problem. So she's like a real contact one.

You can rip you can replace a leg Yeah leg is it's great, but you can replace it. There's not that many moving Parts. You need a knee and ankle and while they're not, you know, it's not replicatable to Perfection like You're like a human leg. They're pretty damn good now but a hand they have not worked out how to do that because you have multiple moving joints that move instinctually you can feel where they are. There's sorry complicated and the robot hands don't even come close. My robot hand is amazing. It's the best in the world. It's about $90,000, but it's a $90,000 beer can holder.	-1.0

Hopefully she wrote it here.	1.0
Oh and they also forced out or foreshadowed all over in Lily's relationship, which I'm sure they did not even know it was going to no, I don't think so because I'm sure that writing didn't happen for many years down the road that was really funny especially from a perspective of right now. Yeah knowing that eventually they would write them in as a couple and several seasons down the road. So that was kind of I like that.	1.0
No, thank God my parents never did that.	-1.0
I know that I have tried to handle all the details. But sometimes God is just calling us to be obedient in just taking a step of Faith out. Right and we most of the time we don't understand how God's plan or his. Promise is going to work out but we need only to be obedient to what he's calling us to like that first step right not having to have it all figured out anxiety stress overwhelm. This all comes like in our life. I know in my life when I try to take when I try to figure out all the details right like when I try to be in control of everything or Get super impatient while waiting for God. In in in when Waiting for God period right like I know that I can become very impatient. Like if I'm like, okay. Yeah. God is definitely calling me to this like let's make it all happen overnight. All right, like I am so impatient. Oh man, but it says Be Still In know I am God. So this is actually in Proverbs or in Psalms. I'm sorry.	1.0
But what I'm saying what you're saying in these peripheral countries is that the political situations are changing because it's clearly not working. Otherwise, you wouldn't have got a Greek government elected on the basis of leaving the Euro same room same in Italy. So I take your point that it would be bad if people left but it's got to be pretty bad if they're campaigning for governments to actually get them out. So This that's not going to get any better really. It's can only I can only see it getting worse and these differentials becoming bigger.	-1.0
Doing well.	1.0
Yeah, you're right. We're starting to give the territory where you get to groupthink with these pics, but A reason why the no offense selection specifically to Green Bay is such a popular one. He fits indeed. It's a good fit for the offense on top of that just like every other player. We're going to pick today. He fits what Green Bay is looking for at the position. He meets their thresholds easily. So I think that Noah fan is an easy selection here, but I'm curious who else is on the board. I may be you said it I just missed it, but I didn't hear Drew lock either.	1.0
Yeah, we've talked about that's unbelievable. We talked about the last episodes of the packing lunch.	1.0

Section 8 and ventilate these people because when they're coming up there's a very misconception that people are hammering with the locks on and they come up swing and they're just fighting. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they're probably fighting but they're hypoxic. They're you know, they're not thinking straight some of them. Yes, they come up you can kick them in withdrawals. If you give too much of a dough. So we generally start with point four point eight than one milligram, etc. Etc. But yeah, we don't like to hammer him right away with one two milligrams immediately because you can cook them. Into withdrawals. There's a very small percentage of people that could present with like a flash pulmonary edema, but the bacon is with those withdrawals. So then yeah, you won one of their going to feel gross from the barf, you know, then could have a whole other vast problems going to go into a seizure. But yeah, usually you're getting a little bit of a fight with them. They're getting a little nasty because of the hypoxia as well write that lack of oxygen for so long.	-1.0
Thank you to everybody who has enjoyed the podcast given feedback five star reviews. Earn you a beer if you ever see us keep that in mind. What is the you have changed our opening music to some crazy heavy metal that is not you fired up. And then but our podcast is like a roller coaster because you start with that and like your heart rate goes nuts and then we come in and we like the Indians are not making a trade, you know, maybe they won't that's you.	1.0
That's a class. It's like you seem like a normie if you're going to talk about SpongeBob, you know what I mean? Cause like that's just like wonderful back to you if you just say I watched SpongeBob, okay, but everyone watched one fathers and so if it's your favorite like that's true at least once or twice. Yeah. Like Regular Show or something like that and that's interesting. You know, I mean regular so I eventually time was good.	-1.0

So if someone's watching this right now and they're like they've never even stepped on a treadmill before and there. Life and you know, their eating habits are really bad.

I mean if you can think of anything draft related, I've probably been working on it. I've got my own personal big board that I've been kind of putting together that I'm hoping to release probably the top 100. I am going to be nowhere near the level that the guys should like the draft. Gar, as far as how in-depth into the prospects I get I'm not able to watch 300 guys. I just don't have the time for that. However, I'm hoping to release the top 100 which would be a first for me. Hopefully working towards maybe a top 200 next year. So but that's kind of hot right now and also the Packers thresholds as one of my I think my proudest little accomplishments that I put together. It's just, you know, I can think Justice mosquito for putting together the hard data and then Then I just kind of put it all together each year and last year. It was relatively predictive. So I decided to do it again this year, even though you know, it's only good to come second year. He pretty much kept to the thresholds that were established under Ron wolf and that and then under Ted Thompson so we can get a little bit more into that, but I'm pretty excited for our show today.	1.0
So and is it a useful just to know what other teams think of of your guys hours it helps it all and that's what the winter meetings are.	1.0
Yeah, and I think one thing you were saying to that or when you were talking that made me think of it is like eye for me like when I'm feeling anxious, I feel like everyone around me knows it. Oh for sure, but I'm really good at hiding it sometimes not necessarily around my kids or my husband. Because you day just kind of always get the worst of you unfortunately because they know you the best but you know, like tally your spouse or tell your kids like I've gotten into the Habit where I'll just tell the least like Haley some really struggling right now. Just give me a minute. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be short with you because I think like just saying it out loud is like this is a real thing. Like if I had a headache I would say hey, I have a headache or I sprained my ankle or whatever. It's like this is a real thing like this is Real condition that I have and you know, it's really flaring up today are probably having a rough day with it and just having somebody to that you can reach out to and sometimes like just laughing about how ridiculous anxiety is because it can get you like the other day Dex came home from school and he just I go are he just doesn't seem like himself. He just seems kind of sad and so are goes. Hey, buddy, so Dax is for okay, he goes hey, buddy. Do you have any pain in your back or your legs or your neck and that's was like I don't think so and here it looks at me and he goes well sometimes kids have cancer, you know, and that's how they find out about it and I was like what the hell if you can't say that to me and then I my brain like when you know, of course like, you know, I have a kid with cancer and how am I gonna deal with this and my mom has cancer but it's like I just had to kind of laugh and just shut it down and be like, nope. We're not gonna yeah. We're not gonna go there. Because it's not doing anything now, sometimes I've heard people what they'll say. Well what if this what if this and then they'll take it all the way? Yeah. Okay. Well, what if that does happen? Hmm. Well, okay. Well what you know and then just kind of played out and I mean even if the worst possible thing for to happen, there are people who they're resilient that you know, we will carry on and so I think it's hard at like it's easy right now to talk about all this because We're not in the middle of like an anxiety storm because with wait till this afternoon is this weekend, right?	-1.0
Hawk babies is terrifying because you're just so these are our so scared. You're gonna clip the kids skin and everything is so tiny.	-1.0
Yeah, well love while stuff. So again, we'll see I will keep you all updated when we get some some proper dates and will also let you know since Lee Daniels is on it. I'm pretty sure this is going to go to the Silver Screen. But again, a lot of these ball picks up going to like lifetime it BTW and stuff. So I'll hope that they you know end up giving it more Justice and put it on the movie theater. So, you know, we'll see how this one goes second bit. Is Wu-Tang they're going back on tour. This is going to be a majority worldwide tour. Obviously, they're going to be in the States but the majority of the legs of the tour or going to be overseas. They are going on tour with Public Enemy and they lost soul and this is going to be called the gods of wrapped or and it starts actually on the first weld it with this is when it did let's give me this one when to take it when I say, oh, I'm sorry, but the actual leg the first leg starts in London on May the 10th, but when they come back to the States, they're going to be in flocks area and going to be in Chicago on June 1st, and then they're going to be in Cleveland Simpsonville, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Asheville Boston on Cassville. I think that's in Connecticut and Landing City Seattle Mountain View, California, Wichita, Kansas Council Bluffs, Iowa, I think and me and hapless, Minnesota on August 2nd. What to end the tour now I know that we did talk about will take last album, which we didn't think was very good. But I'm more than certain expenses just going on tour Public Enemy. They'll also they're going to be doing a lot of old stuff like that's that's just what it is, especially for the we talked about this before as well how a lot of a lot of people overseas like that's where they get their money and if you can still go overseas and still perform all your old hits, then you're still popping and people overseas love love artist over here and they love all of Their old stuff that they that they came out with over a year. So how you feel about this tour with this be something that you will be slightly interested in since they're coming to school.	1.0
Super bot in man. I think the director Jon Favreau who's just incredible. He's so talented. It's he done. He did Chef remember having seen that some a lot of shit man. He's really really talented and then Dave filoni he did. He basically did all the cartoons for Star Wars which was really dope. And so it's like edit strikes that Vibe too. So I'm super excited. Let's keep watching it. There's only eight episodes 30 40 minutes. It's I think it's super worth it and Disney plus Rock so I'm a big hill.	1.0
Yeah, even when this films that I've been in and out when I'm like but this is how I pay the bills so I gotta do this one.	1.0

What is right or wrong.	0.0
And I guess you're like you said, they're very complementary businesses. But at the end of the day, they're still two separate businesses and different. In the in the sense that although the obviously there's some crossover in the fact that you've got home Wares and things that you can use in staging as well one is still a retail store and one is a service. How do you find running two businesses that are very different at the same time?	0.0
So I like I had started right at home staging in. And just as I'd move back to be you this home where Shop opened up and it was amazing. I would go there and buy pieces for staging and then 12 months later or less the owner put it up for sale and my cousin just off the cuff said maybe we should buy it. That's what we did. We went in and we bought this home where shop and it actually is a real blessing in disguise for right at home staging because I can access A lot of products through the shop and also they kind of a good advertising for either side of the business. So if I use some art in runner home staging, you know, you can buy through the Hub so good cross promotion and it's a it's another creative outlet for me when I'm not staging so I really love it.	1.0
If you happen to buy a bull that was you know, the similar genetic line do you have well, I you know, I it's not so much about when I'm riding bulls as much as you know, like I said, I like the speedballs because I grew up around them. But then for me now I like going back to any Anything that that's related to page blood and that's just because of value, you know, we were talking about jive turkey while ago again, he comes up and Toby Floyd rays that go but he's out of a page bull. I don't know what I that's messing about that. I think yeah. Okay. So whatever that is, I don't know but you bull guys know what he is.	1.0
It can be very tiring. I do sometimes find it quite mentally draining because there is so many things that you need to do as a business owner and so for me, that's kind of doubled in both businesses. I'm my cousin Amanda who owns The Hub with me we have found it quite difficult because we've never run a retail shop before and at the moment retail is in a recession in Australia. It's very quiet, but it is quite tiring at times but also very rewarding as cliché as that sounds I don't I couldn't imagine my life without either business.	-1.0
I thought was pretty good until next.	1.0
Do you think well, I mean what happened if the Central Bank does no longer increase the money supply so its own money. Yeah, right or if it doesn't increase it enough so that people who have been counting on the stronger increases. I left in the cold as we've seen lat. Actually quite with the liquidity issues on new are so if something of this at this can spill over right and that's also the reason why the Central Bank step very vigorously in and prevented that interest rates would rise further and panic would Spread spread and so on so under these circumstances, there's no definition of a meltdown, right? But of course my solving a problem springing from debt with more credits. You do not provide a true solution. Yes problems. Right? I mean, this is something that most people are understood that we are in a very tired are paradoxical situation. They were trying to solve problems bringing from debt with there are more credit. This of course observe because we are just reproducing the problems that we had in the past on a higher level almost exactly as Marx put it in the capitalist system reproduces his own problems on a larger scale because it's not difficult to guess.	-1.0
So I'm allowing myself to record it again and see how it goes. So yeah, I I wanted to talk a little bit about friendship. You know, I am really selective about who I spend time with because you know, like I've been in recovery now from my eating disorder and like pretty much sober for about 8 months which is less than a human gestation period and it's still really new and it Really new and it takes a lot of work. And so I kind of treat myself with gentleness and acknowledge how much mental real estate this is occupying. It really beats being fully in the disease or in relapse, but you know, I do treat myself. not carefully or gingerly or with kid gloves or anything just with like, you know, just a little more tenderness than I have historically and so yeah, like I might not see a lot of people really often like I shared earlier about how I manage my day and how I only really take on two large chunks of activity a day because any more than that and I just get really anxious and	-1.0

I think it's more the latter. I mean for me, you know not having a relationship with my biological father is it?

Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying like that's that's a few and look at TV Dude TV. Is also like all these Netflix deals that are all these twitch deals that you can stream certain shows on Amazon. That's like the next level because people want to be the content, you know, and I think just viewing the content isn't enough for our brains now just passively watching something you everyone wants to participate in it and Twitches like gaming is the ultimate medium. That's right because it's like a sub entertainment now, you know, it's like weird. It's like you it's chat is responsible for Providing a good stream in some ways. You know, it's like hey, it's a very strange phenomenon was he just did he talk about Twitch in that book or know? So I mean he taught he basically it's a really good book. I suggest everyone reads it but he basically talked about the emergence of like modern entertainment and the sense of like The Simpsons being the one to break the ground basically completely breaking the fourth wall inviting people to participate almost in the sense of like like this is ironic. I'm going to make fun of things in a very ironic way and You know it as an advice like as someone who's smart and pays attention like you can participate in that because only you understand this for reference. And then in the same same stance like Twitches in the live entertainment is the same way like you can under you are able to watch this at this present moment and can participate in it. So he's saying that basically his product prediction is that people will get more and more involved in the content that they consume until it becomes extremely homogeneous, you know. Yeah, it like breaks down the relationship of An audience number until everyone is up on the podium together. You know.	1.0

Yeah, I think so and I think that's where what like your strong suit is like like you get story like you have all sorts of great ideas and where your story sounds really comes out is in Your visuals like I you know when I give you a signal we're going to shoot and I have the storyboard and I'm like, I think it's going to look something like this like you're interested like okay, where are these characters heads out where they're doing and you shape your lighting and angles and stuff kind of around that like whatever. I might not have already thought about that's where you jump in. You're like, I want to have, you know a dark back here because you know Duality or whatever, you know, and like that's that's a, you know, a huge part of the storytelling as well as well as the place where you Excel that I do pretty much nothing with is, you know, Partnerships with Brands stuff like that you're able to I mean, it's at the moment. We're still working on our funding but at the moment, it seems like the majority of its going to come from you being able to talk to these Brands they like hey, here's how making this movie can help you guys out and exchange for you to give a little bit of money to actually make it. Yeah and like so far it's looking like we're gonna get a bit of money out of that and that's something that I would not be able to like, that's not I'm not I don't really create content for Brands other than it might like my day job, but I don't sell that content to help make it.	1.0
The defense of the FED though, if you take information and strip out inflation, the inflation X inflation rate is remarkably static over time. I got in case you're interested. I got that off at a satirical u.s. Website called long or short Capital. Well, I thought it was rather good the inflation X inflation rate.

So take the time and thank everybody and thank them by pre-ordering / or during the draft guy.	1.0
I think they both could be tough to see how much is a it's a tough place to go. So four points is really stick and I think reasonable. Yeah, definitely. I don't know. It doesn't matter how they come with us a pointer or three points away. But yeah, I'd say four points, but after that it's we could have range from anything to zero point mean if we don't if you don't lose one of them was that we're gonna be 11.	-1.0

Yeah.	1.0
No, I agree. I'm really excited draft is always been kind of my thing as well. I've watched it every year really going back to when I Javon Walker was drafted. I've watched almost every round every year since then so it's been a long time of watching the draft on and on this guy's case and and in recent years I've gone with you guys a little bit with the threshold and what focusing on the relative Athletic score and doing a little more mocking and just reading up lil bit more and kind of paying more attention to people who aren't named Mel. But we look at this year specifically there is a lot going on for what the Packers could do their work in free agency over the past week bringing in a miss the Smith and Billy Turner have really made things a little less clear as to what they're going to do in the draft. They don't have to go get an edge right away. They don't have to go get alignment right away tight end to you probably should but if there's there's still options out there for what Brian go to comes can do and this is the perfect draft class for him to make moves and move around and get the guy. He wants no matter what position it might be a couple.	1.0
Well, that's for the job that they're asking me to do it. Yeah, but that's over.	1.0
Glad to have you here. We did meet recently at the symposium. Dan in Sydney for the first time so that was kind of the first time that we met face-to-face and now we get to talk a little bit. I think what most of our interactions as they would be with most others in the industry are online and social media. So it's kind of nice to be do something a bit different.	1.0

I'm sure I mean again it goes back to it's all about the core four and then everybody else is just at the whims of whatever the story dictates. I guess we could use Kevin for a scene here. Ok, let's write Kevin and see him but we're not going to do anything else with that character until we need them again. Like it's a little frustrating for moments like this because it's I could go either way with at least the amount of screen time that you've given me on Riverdale of Kevin. I could go either way to whether he's being truthful it better or not. Mmm.	-1.0
What are y'all ready? All right guys, you mentioned and I'm really really nice toast.	1.0
It's like I've never jump I never did any plyo exercises before so it's really scary, but it's fun at the same time and I was really hook about it.	1.0
So I know I didn't take off fast. I'm jumping here because my brain doesn't work here - come on me. I'm still covering. I think I may have got got some brain damage. No, so I didn't take off fast. The first k I felt very comfortable first sort of 500 meters or so. I felt very comfortable. But there was a big pack of guys blocking the track in front and then we came came we came to the first style and climbing arnall and then you're waiting you just standing there and then I thought there's going to be so much of this waiting. And so what I did I thought I'm just going to get myself some space and I like so I jumped when I climbed over a style. I just accelerated and I broke away and I I just I wanted to put a bit of space between me and the group because I just got sick of this is where local knowledge comes into its own. Yeah, and so I known as I pushed her and I felt great which was a good feeling, you know, like I didn't feel like I was running threshold or anything else till conversational. But yes, I was running about five minute case in that first couple of kilometers and and running you're running through paddocks already and through long grass and and the lead At that point I was in second place. So Andrew Hoff who's a phenomenal Runner who I interviewed on the podcast a while back. He was already after a kilometer. He was already a couple hundred meters in front. And so and then he disappeared and went on to break the course record broke broke Brandon Davies course record, and I think he got 9 hours and 43 minutes so which is phenomenal and he's and I would dare say that and Who's not even in the best shape of his life yet? And so he's just a good runner. But anyway, so I'm running and I probably about the first ten kilometers. There's no major. There's a fair Climate about kilometer 6 to 7, where you go up this long road, we your dirt road and you just it's a it's a just a grinding uphill climb and there was me and this other this young bloke will running together second third for all of that and just we'll just check. But we will just sort of holding a reasonable pace and then we came down through the forest into Inman Valley which is checkpoint 1 and about that would be it about kilometer 16 and I was very quick turnaround. I got I filled up my my my bladder filled up grab some food said Thank you to the volunteers and then we were off again and So from from checkpoint one to the next checkpoint to is your where it starts to get a little bit tough, you know, so you there's only five checkpoints in the whole race. And so you really got to be self-sufficient and I was feeling really good at this point. I was just like yeah loving it conditions are good legs feel good. Everything felt good. So I kept running a bit well, and then there's a fair grind as you going up another Hill and you work your way on these Road Hills until You come to the first technical section, which is not until about kilometer 24 23 24, maybe. Yeah 24 and your head into my ponga Conservation Park, which is go so you're going from running on these dirt roads. It's very runnable, even though there's some climbing to the some of the most technical terrain you can get and it's a this is the part that breaks people really early. This is actually where I had my first low point. So you're going to my ponga their traffic is it just yet was there for a second?	1.0
Came from our names like about that Community about being together. We need gold to each other. Yeah, right and the well, that's our motto as well as like That's what I want to bring here is to bring a positive positive thing to our members lives like right and help each other in any positive way. Yeah, so iron sharpens iron and some days. I don't like have man sharpens another right? So luckily I've got not rejected.	1.0
Okay. So the one thing that redeem this episode for me was in fact the ending, however We already discussed how the ending was kind of a little much because they were like, oh like we should have forgiven each other before me like blah blah blah and that was just in genuine. However, the message kind of was genuine to me.	1.0
But I always I feel like it's so much fear because I remember feeling I remember being on the opposite side of that I could see myself introducing someone as a non-Christian back in the day, not tomorrow. Yeah, but I was I love God so much and I have for so long that if anyone didn't have that and then and then when I can Christian church or an Evangelical Church when they're pounding into our heads like you said, this is your identity. This is the thing that gives you purpose. This is where true happiness. Flies I just felt sad for people that didn't have that. I wanted them to have like salvation. And then when I was even younger I was so scared of everyone going to hell. I was like, oh God, I love Nicole so much. I really don't want her to go to Holland is actually like excuse perience a genuine heartbreak on both and and it's not healthy for either party.	1.0

No, it's like basically the salt like a little very small amount.	-1.0

Yeah. I had a record deal before I booked my first movie A lot of people don't know that and so it was me and my cousin we had a group called wolf pack and we were trying to get after it. But that was the gatekeeper days. That was when you couldn't I mean it didn't you know right now you can just hit send and this out to the world and it is what it is and you know, they wanted I was kind of an Ali and his sense of now there's just hit movie out and we got this kid signing with deal but he's spitting up because we was more awesome like revolutionary kind of Dead Prez type of field and it was like nah, we we need the radio and I'm like, well, that's not me. So it's just got bottleneck that that you know at that at that point and I was young too. I was young little bit cocky. I guess you could say because I've this things I look back on like I remember sitting in cash. Now's office and he heard the demo we had he was like Ayo, I'll put you in the studio with primo and y'all do for joints and my dumbass goes now my man need to do the beach.	-1.0
I would want to run away from that and I want to run towards it. I am slow motion.	-1.0
He's that's a good term.	1.0
Right and I need to and I'm going to suffer the consequences of my of my bad choice, but instead it is it's so much easier to vent our frustrations in our anger and try to place it on somebody else. So at the end of the night, I went upstairs and I looked at my husband and I was like I don't even think I said anything we both started laughing and I was like, you know, I'm Kat I've been asking the Lord to soften my heart about this to forgive me. I was like, it's so hard. You know what I told him. I was like, I really don't want to be nice to you right now. And that's when we started laughing because I knew that it was even though I could not replace this or an imminent, right?	-1.0
At times need to be wiped down more frequently than just areas that maybe need to be dusted weekly.	0.0
You don't want to bring them to your church because they're going to think it's weird or you don't want to you know, You don't want to talk about the things of God with them or the things that you feel called to do because you know some somewhere deep down inside. You know, that they're not on the same page with you. Well, that's the first thing you need to you need to dump them because they are not on the same page with you and especially if you're a woman and you're looking at this guy and you're like, you know truly he's not everything that I ever thought that I could have in a husband but you know, the devil's lied to you to make you think that you this is as good as it's gonna get I want to tell you if you're in a relationship like that. Get out of it quick and just be thankful that you didn't get married already and just be great glad that you still have time. God can restore redeem and he can push you with the right person, but don't be caught in this trap the way you think that since you're in this relationship already that now you have to conform your life to fit into this relationship with this person. That doesn't have a Zeal for God like you have just because you're already in the relationship for whatever reason it's not it's not permanent. And you know, if you are married then you need to now pray for your spouse. You need to now make it your goal that you're going to believe God that this person is going to come around on the same page with you, but I will tell you that's the harder road to take. So if you're not married to that person yet. Don't marry them based on the fact that you think well because they're just so cute that everything's going to work out even though they have no Zeal for God and you know that you can run circles around them spiritually and they're not even interested.	-1.0
Yeah, and I think everyone would agree.	1.0
So fun, I think it's been important to to describe like this is what the judges are looking for.	1.0
Yeah, I mean I wouldn't as same thing for me like at 12. That was when I first was told that I'd be worthless if I had sex before marriage and like you're saying identity wrapped in Christ. My identity was wrapped in my virginity that was definitely an aspect of it as well. Yeah, so like and then when I wasn't a virgin anymore and even when I was married, I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know what made me a good. Person anymore because that's all I was like, that's all I heard about. What a good person is a good person is a virgin. Well, yeah. Yeah, it's a disaster. So my Christian advice to anyone in countering any theist or someone that simply doesn't believe the same things or God forbid a Christian that actually believes different things than you two just like trust the Holy Spirit if you believe in God you Proclaim to like believe that Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit puffs. Faith that like everyone is on their own journey and everyone's going at their own rate.	-1.0
So the real honey is we are the first company that takes it even one step further.

Well, I'm in a bralette like and now it's like full-blown lingerie. Like the lighting is on point hair and makeup is on fleek at all times Yeah. We actually she could sheet room clean when we lived together us and our other roommate decided that we wanted to take some Some group nudes. They were beautiful. They were works of art and now they hang in our home for my 30th birthday my 30th. It was my 30th birthday. I went to Paris and Mike had the best time and we had taken these nudes like right before I had gone. So I came home and Jaclyn like in our other roommate Meg who is a delight set up this whole birthday thing for me. And Jacqueline got me a full-blown canvas of one of our nudes that still hangs in my home to this day. The biggest size will take it. Yeah, it's gorgeous. It's like a shot from above. It's like we're in these beautiful like red and black colored coordinating panties and undies and it's probably my favorite picture. It makes me feel like a whole Queen. I love them. So yeah - yeah, so I post pictures on Earth. Well posed pictures that We'll definitely be there maybe one of the other ones from the shoot to like the one that's literally hanging on Jacqueline's fridge for all to see her all to see. Well, I think that's the thing is like you have to be confident in your own body and I don't take these for anybody else like I guess that first time I did but like I feel like it's 2019 like I'm out here taking these for me. Hmm and you yeah, so it's like I'm not knocking it. Send it to you because I need you to be like that's a good one. That's a bad one. Your ass looks amazing. Right we don't live together now. So like we have to send them to each other exactly like I can't just come in your room and be like is this a cute outfit to wear in a nude? I know it's tough. Also, I feel like when we say nudes it's like a range of things. It's like full blown like I'm in a robe cute towel to like up my vagina shot. Hi. How many vaginas shot? Yes, that's me. Neither.

Yeah. Yeah, and there's been and so I think when you think about particularly in this audience, the construction users Roundtable, which is comprised of a lot of industrial owners. All side says something they're pretty familiar with and it's really their conversations are how do we continue to push the envelope? How do we do more of it? And how do we get the rest of the industry on board namely contractors and I think - real space is an area where owners have really been leaders and that regard because the incentives are there two things off site or as maybe you look at the commercial side of the industry where commercial owners have kind of said well contractors can go figure it out. And if you can deliver a building faster or cheaper through off-site construction, we'd be interested in contractors go. Okay, great. We're not Apple or Google and we'll have billions of dollars worth of R&D to go figure this out come up with a new mouse trap. So it's innovation in manufacturing and off-site construction is sort of limped along this some extent and the and the commercial space because there's been a lack of funding or interest or incentives on either contractors around or side on the big stuff.	1.0

I'm a And it's like that's but that's part of you. That's all of you. You know that the good the bad the not so good and I think like if you can't take me with my the best of me you're at can't take the well, well they say with if you can't have the worst of you can have the best of me kind of right have you got it's all the all makes you part of it, you know, like for us to like some of that achieving that anxiety kind of helps us to achieve more and the you know me like worrying about people and caring that makes me really caring person. So there are aspects of anxiety that are good. I think it's just when it gets out of control and it becomes like a train that just won't stop and you can't make it.	1.0

Listen to fall into a life of sin, you know, and that's the thing, you know our life as Believers. We've been called to a higher standard and then you know on top of that, you know, if you if you want to go the extra mile and you want to be a person you feel that you're called into Ministry. Then you go the the extra extra mile to be an example to other believers, but whether you are a Ministry or not, you're an example to Believers, you're an example in your love and your faith in your Purity. And so you have to be you have to be on your on your A game when it comes to what two people see it. If I had to wear a t-shirt that said this is you know, my life mission statement. I don't pick it. It's just what people have evaluated of Me by what they see on my Instagram by what they see me doing what I actually want to wear that t-shirt. You know what I be or would I be ashamed of what people think of me and what people say of me when I'm not around so, you know, we want to challenge you and there's probably a lot more that we could say on this but you know as a single young person in this is the question we get so much, you know, what do I do with my singlehood years? as you know, how do I what what is what is expected of me as a single person and I'm going to do some more podcasts on this because I believe it's something that if you're if you guys are if you guys are wanting to hear more on it, we want to we want to be talking more on it because you getting bombarded so much with impunity and and immorality and so we want to be that voice that tells you you know, what if you're being pure stay on the path God is so proud of you for setting yourself apart and for putting a you know, putting yourself in a position that yeah it may make Stand out to the world and maybe even make you stand out to your family.

So the generally the naloxone has a shelf life and like 45 minutes 40 minutes somewhere around there I think and so the opiates will reattach to the ER opiate receptors in your body and then you'll start going on and not again, so it's just exactly what sounds like you're nodding off asleep you're falling asleep. So they could potentially go down again generally will give repeat doses over with them or by that time the hospital will end up giving a repeat dose if they're still willing to stay in the hospital. Some people actually go on the locks on drip in the Bill because they've got such strong opiates in their system.	-1.0

I had to watch the fucking the the football game in the bedroom last night on our worst TV because she needs to hang out with the tree in the living room with the lights on and all that shit when she needs to maximize it as much as possible. So we get the tree this weekend.	-1.0
I think yeah, I think that's going to be the one thing that's going to be a little bit of a struggle in the type fall to a campaign. Like I was just like you I bought Titanfall 2 on sale like probably 20 bucks. It was yeah, it definitely wasn't on release and bought it for the campaign because my friends were telling me I had needed to play the game but I got caught up in the multiplayer. I think I was playing the multiplayer for a month before I actually decided okay. I'm going to To pick away at the campaign and the campaign honestly is a lot shorter than what you expect. Right? Yeah, you don't have to dedicate too long to it. But the moment I finished that campaign Titanfall instantly became one of my favorite games of all time. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't want to blow the ending and it will hear our kids though. I mean the story itself is probably the reason why a lot of people are a big Titanfall 2 fans, but the whole Apex Legends reference Reference I think that was that's like really really cool. And I know that the I hope that they respond cut it does the same thing they did with Titanfall 2 was they sometimes had a little bit of lore that they would add on to the game in general, but you had to find on the internet in terms of like like scripted cartoons or something, but I hope that they do that with Apex just to give a bit more background to all the characters and I don't know about the whole Jack Cooper Legend to like I would love that. Yeah, but I feel like his ability is might be a bit o p yeah.	1.0

How Rogue chemists are creating the deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic and he just talks about it like him when he went to you goes to China and it's like the drug dealers are kind of making this stuff and I cheap it is to get hold of this stuff. Right? It's insane which is why everyone's cutting it with cutting it into everything. It's just it's a quick easy boost. I think he said something like it's just like 50 times. Stronger than heroin so to Rice grains of it basically can can absolutely decimate it like insanity episode 2 listening to you.	-1.0
All right. All right. Well, I'll let me bring this up. I think able companies are actually It's going to it's going to do a cycle and come back to cable companies. I can tell you this right now because so many different types of streaming services are coming up and they're taking all their shows basically off of Netflix and they're like, okay. Well now you have to get our streaming service fee and watch the show. So, okay. I want to watch Friends.

Anyway, I think that Danka he's pretty much saved us about doesn't he like they slide in has been unreal. I was really worried and we know we can play there. But yeah, I'm real seis on the left. I think when Polly comes back I don't be harsh and then dunker I would just slap body back and on the right. So he's remembering its besiktas away using real that game. So you have to fair play to Dent Anka. I mean like I say he saved us because I was really worried when body got injured, but the way he slaughtered in has been incredible. I think I'll come over for said it last time but but I think we look better going forward with those to the back because they bring the ball in to Midfield don't like a bit more fluid than previously we retain possession a lot better as well so far.	-1.0

Yeah, so I think honestly here I'm looking. This is possibly where we might see a running back come off the board. I think we're going to see the Packers pursue a past catching running back a passing specialist running back. There's a couple of them in this year's draft one of the James Williams from Washington State. He might be around five pick. He doesn't meet any of the thresholds necessarily he kind of is just below all of them. I think Miles Sanders is like the only one that meets them. All right now. Tony Pollard from Memphis is a guy who's kind of rising updraft boards as well. So this is where it really starts to get interesting with the Packers decide to do where they did where they decide to add depth, but I think what I'm doing here personally is I'm looking at a guy like dalen mac. So a guy like dalen mac. He's he meets the thresholds for the most part. He's a little little less agile than you'd want him to but he's a true nose tackle. He would take some of the duties off of Kenny Clarke the Packers have already met. With him, once which kind of says a lot to me, they're not meeting with a lot of players at this point, which is very surprising to me as considering the amount of visits at the rest of the teams in the league of had but the Packers have not met with a lot of players. So I feel like they're kind of they've already got their guys that they're kind of like targeting in on day lamech is a guy they've already met with I believe that was back at the Senior Bowl and he's a guy who pretty much meets what they're looking for. He's going to be a specialist guy, but he's gonna he's gonna be a tremendous nose. The NFL he won't provide much more. Other than that, but you'll be a tremendous run Defender and he can provide some juice from the interior as a pass rusher as well. He's got some he's got some nice moves that he likes to whip out every now and then so I'm looking at a guy like Darren Mack here. That would be my value pick and my best fit.	1.0

That's where a lot of the circular thinking and rumination comes from so sometimes I just let it out and it just makes it a lot. Better but yeah, so what I had to sort of assume like the first baby step I took in this entire Enterprise of like human decency and I city is that I just like pretended as if people cared about my response like I used to be the king of being like, oh, you know just fine Kelly and you know, whatever like tired or like.	1.0

Shantabai, it's not an obligation. That was it.	1.0
And cut around the country by right?	0.0
Danzo's the timing on that. The delivery was just purchase pristine. It was me.	1.0
And then I remember it exactly how messy that was what it was because I remember the interview because I had a scheduled like webcam interview with two of the people. All that were in charge of that and they just like ask me a bunch of questions. So they've asked me like who's your favorite character? When did you start watching the show? What is your favorite thing about the show and literally my favorite character was Styles. I started watching the show when it first started airing like the very first episode I tuned in and I told them like my favorite part of the show is steric and they were like, why is that, you know, your favorite part of the show and I explain to them why I liked the two characters together and like Part of what shipping was like I gave them kind of like a like Outsider kind of information. So I didn't go into like depth as to what it was and they seem fine with it. Like they didn't seem like shocked they're like hesitant and then of you went fine, and then I guess I got handed down to the other people who were like no, but they did have a steric on they had it right when they changed president's yeah. They had a guy. Who was supposed to be doing like a game like a video game? Yes, and I never happen. I wonder why they probably got shut down or something and they were like you can't make this even though it was going to be like out of his own time and again nothing to do but the show but that game never came out. But I remember he had like video footage of like the first like be getting up. Game, yeah and looked fine. Like I was excited for it, but it never came out.	1.0
Yeah, I was I was actually surprised when the Netherlands were able to make it. That far it was one of the weird things that I looked at. Yeah, because Sweden won third place against England wanted to today. Wow.	1.0
He was trying to like cut each to like bringing the Skiles fans. Like they have a so gross so that they would watch now a cut pocalypse.	-1.0
Yeah, you did make that me happens to me all the time. You get your whiff of that fucking cylinder of fucking repulsive.	-1.0
They make pretty cool gear. They make the snagger tool which we talked about. I've seen it used.	1.0
No, it's Batman and Robin with George Clooney and mr. Free forever was with Kilmer, which is the Riddler and timely Jones Batman and Robin. Is George Clooney Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy in arms, but it's on it's believable how bad that movie it's so good Alicia Silverstone Alicia Silverstone.	-1.0
I never really blind the shock. It wasn't it's just that she's doing stuff.	-1.0
So I love that about like twitch and YouTube. It's like everyone who knows knows and if you don't you're just a boomer like an actual Boomer like not even the meme. You know, yeah, that's it. So safe.	1.0
The worst thing was the day like the day after the Friday when we were flying back. Back, it was still the same weather in Porto. So everyone obviously again on the plane the couple of jackets big coat and then we flew to Lisbon before flying back to England and Lisbon was like 20 degrees. So you get out the flipping trivial I transfer you sweating will you like panicking when they pitch inspection that was happening?	-1.0
I agree and I think that comes with positives and negatives but I think the positives outweigh the negatives where it's like fuck you and also fuck you too, but it's kind of funny, you know like that, you know, because that's a thing. I feel like this is gonna sound like very Boomer talk, but I feel like the actual Baby Boomers don't understand that about the internet, you know, like the actual baby boomers are like, oh my God. Russia and oh my God, like these huge issues on the internet but like YouTube is consuming my kids days and nights, you know, but the kids know it's like a big meme, you know, and nothing is really serious and it's like an inside joke with the kids who know something that the adults don't don't you explain it to them.	1.0
Oh, yeah. Yeah definitely have some parents come and you know be there for the prom to like security what I do.	1.0
Yeah, I did it. Oh, that's a spoiler. That's okay, dude. I forgot.	1.0
Well, hopefully it's just good timing and now running slowly introduces a little bit more anyway, so yeah not really care.	1.0
Yeah. Okay. Why are we so you don't have any excuses what you're saying?	1.0
Hmm. All right. So finally we have the album suggestion section flock. What do you have for us this week?	1.0

Google so we bought our tree on Saturday and because they fucked up the trunk as I said this on the live earlier, right? So like usually the tree place trims the trunk and trims the shitty branches the bottom of the tree cleans it up for you and I think because we bought a tree from like this look specials rack and we didn't realize it the guy didn't give us any fucking but he didn't even put it in the tree stand with a lot of times I do for you to have to worry about that. You didn't do that. So we get home and I get rid of some of these shitty branches and there's like two feet of just bear trunk. Mama Bear was not having it. So we didn't end up decorating on Saturday night. How tall is the tree at the end like four feet? No, it's actually still pretty tall because we got one without all that it was like bumping the top of the ceiling we have tall ceiling. Yeah, so we didn't end up decorating them Saturday night, which was the plan. So on Sunday morning. I had to saw part of the tree off with a hand saw and then we decorate it on Sunday afternoon and the entire time we're doing a time like I am so glad my nine-year-old is 9 years old so that he can decorate the tree so that I don't have I can do it except I still had to do wrap around with this is the worst part wrap around with the lights that and then like the beads and all that shit.	-1.0
Yeah, I'm sorry ashes in there.	-1.0
But the other thing is that like Oliver and Miley are like in the end and the end of episode like talking about how close they were like out like stuff.	1.0
Yeah, I'm surprised you're taking this.	-1.0
So I told to my wife. Hey, how is it hard is it it's really hard to just open up a box because my idea there's like I could have my own place to train because it still looks like yeah, I'm just training two hours a day is like, yeah, it's gonna be much easier if I could have my own place to pay and not travel.	1.0
So we will have these degrees that were bet would be better place mats. Yeah for the most part.	1.0
Okay. Well see this that's a if I live with my parents my entire life, but most likely be dead, you know, like before I die. So like technically would I die at the same time they die because if I'm going to be late my parents would have to either live until I die or I die when they die, you know what I mean? Patsy that's the type of thinking you have.	-1.0
There's no way he can feel that good all the time.	-1.0

It's been a couple of goals like that that have just shown everything that's good about our attacking play within two or three seconds. And then we score a goal everything from that goal was perfect and showed bettina's class and think a quick-thinking tray. All right is showing that he's on the same page everybody else now and making that run and human has his His and product from compared to last year particularly good like I'm real and and if you notice all writing about 85% of the time we attacked on the right now because I think of some Jolly Joe or on the other white did that much today really was always going down the right way to take some imagery.	1.0
Else and it's just like like and then the thing too is like well, you don't know how the games like how the modes going to play right?	-1.0
So they're just like we gotta tie these bitches how I don't suppose that the Vodka they're busy nap time. Okay, bust out the tequila.	-1.0
In there, you kind of look at that as an accomplishment, but you know, you have to be active you keep using that word active in Paris. And that's the truth. Like you can't just send a check or pay bills like you gotta be active because kids remember everything but money they remember time. Yeah. They remember when you weren't there exactly. Yeah. So, you know for me I would say, you know, it was more about out of there was no pattern that continued. I think it was just like I set the It for me was going to be the opposite of what he presented.	-1.0
So he was like a year and a half old. She was born into June 2009. Okay, it's this handprint and there's like Little Snowmen and oh my gosh, it's a glass ornament is my favorite ornament because it can't be replaced. Right? So I like I double box it when I put it away and I store it and when I take it out, I put it high up on the tree. So none of my other kids can touch it. Like I love this ornament it if it breaks All Is Lost right? So I finally took down the tree after New Year, but I first took all the ornaments off because I really just wanted to get the tree like out so I took the ornaments off I put him in a little pile. I took the tree down. I like swept and stuff and all of a sudden it was like boom. My Deegan was awake. My two-year-old like things got crazy. My husband came home. Home at the same time and I had to go take a meal to a friend because she had just had a baby that was in the hospital. All right, whatever. So I'm like, oh my gosh, babe. I have to go take this meal. And so while you're watching football, can you just like start putting away those ornaments boom? I was out right? I should have put away and I the first thing I thought to was like you should probably put that ornament away ever, but I was like nah, that's fine. Right dumb because my two-year-old and a four-year-old were up. Round I should have known I should have known and I was like the Lord told me you need to put that ornament away, right? But I didn't so I came home and Lord.	1.0
I was a little sad on that one actually Ricky that tell them about what was going down with me though.	-1.0
Yeah. All right, let's so back then. I kind of know if this I have that passions like well, I can't explain the movements right and back dead before I got my in Before I tried to get my internship after I move after I went to States. I got my L1 certification just just just for myself.	1.0
We're going to different direction and she had to start from square one about three days before but being on a show like this, like if something doesn't work, you have to change it, you know, right there should be a lot of like little tiny changes here and there but when there's a drastic change she was able to just snap into it and just like Curry. Eight the coolest great.	1.0
Yeah, we have a big party and we know we've got for that. Yeah.	1.0
I'm sad I think both of you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're gonna get our shit in order open up our animal shelter, then we'll have kids together probably. Yeah or just dogs and cats.	-1.0
I think it's giving me plenty To Wong Foo realness kind of we went to my least favorite. I have to say the hey I just was too there was too much and I know she's usually so so like spot-on. I just there was this things on the shoes and then the dress and then the head He's and then the earrings and I just wish it was just the dress and a simple shoe. I don't know. It just it was too much.	-1.0
That's what I do in HPD all freaking dead. I do want to Pat myself on the back for one thing though. I did mention that I thought the Angels would make a lot of sense for Corey kluber and then like three hours later. There was actual smoke on that so good job TJ, putting that together anybody with a third grade education could have match those two, but I did it on the podcast and then it became reality.	1.0
It doesn't perfect her Ballroom technique, but it is definitely really good at like jazz your type things and like the Pumped kind of dance move. She's really natural at it. Like there's some things. I remember Posh. I came home from one of the first like rehearsals he has with her and they did a Cha-Cha and they had like this like funky move in there. He's like, it's just I didn't teach like I don't have to teach her that she just did it naturally and she just made it look great. So he's like I have to use that because her like comedic skills and like the way she moves her body when she does do her comedy is very simple like similar to the Cha-Cha or Jazzy or quick subtype 5, so it's very easy for him to teach her that kind of stuff. But when it comes to the technique, obviously, it's very difficult, right? She does a great job learning it. So there's definitely a great sense of her body awareness. She knows what she's doing. Not so it's very helpful.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know about that. Oh, yeah ain't going back to Burrell like therefore bar set up like that. That's that's the Pharrell sound read. The four bar setup is for Real sound who else I want to mention and why can't I remember his name now and this is kind of kind of sad.	-1.0
So scrub that out wipe down the handle, you know, maybe you need to go a little bit deeper and actually clean the shelves the walls whatever you need to do if it's a	0.0
So you want to know where to get a spaghetti dress. He will be able to tell you.	1.0
It's lazy writing. Honestly, like very lazy writing. That's this whole show has lazy writing and I'll definitely have a couple more notes about At but I just was like dog and and while they were in the car, all of the lines were total plot narration, like explaining and feeding the audience stuff that we didn't already know which I guess is like Fair because it's only the second episode by you just referring to the fact that like Oliver had a crush on her.	-1.0
They're all very there's a lot of variations of different programs out there different splits, you know, but the most important thing again is just consistency because I don't focus on the Minor Details. I mean if you are only able to go to the gym three times a week, I would probably do a leg Push Pull or three full body workouts or depending on whatever your goals are. You just have to prioritize that workout program towards whatever your goal is. Gotcha.	1.0

But you know, you get to that that that point that you're talking about with the boy is like testing the waters already.	-1.0
Look inside your soul.	1.0
That was like, it's his crappy looking as you remember video stories looking into can it is in the best way possible.	-1.0
Yeah, I felt like pretty good. We had a pretty good crew in the in the hall. Yeah. It's a big thing that I've been working in. My normal job. A lot is a lot of Education and Training people on the locks own and just changing a lot of the stigmas and the Misinformation out there voted as well because everything is a miracle drug and and you know, there's lots of things that people are ingesting and so are smoking or or injecting and in our locks on will not actually reduce or reverse those effects with more people think that if somebody takes something and they've overdose that naloxone is the golden ticket is not so lots of good information with that.	0.0
Yeah Douglas attitudes terrible at parallel. But yeah, I do think I do think he's days are numbered the injury hasn't helped but if you look at the shame, he's been a good servant of the last night.	-1.0

To kill some of the flying creatures using Hank Marlo's Katana a in case you know what that is a gitanos a sword. And the skull crawler then set its eyes on Conrad and and reg slivko, but we were rescued them by tossing a lighter. I one of the Subterranean events creating an explosion that killed the skull color immediately. Then then the giant skull crawler which given the nickname scold devil was waked due to seismic explosive dropped on the Skull Island along with the rest of his kind after calling was incapacitated by Packard. It's called out the skull devil left. His presence be known by emerging. From the bed to the water thus and that began a three part about it what's called? I will have the upper hand on confidentially. And as he changed and as he chased James Conrad and the other survivors of the research that I've mentioned said to Skull Island Earl Cole tried to sacrifice himself by arming several grenades before having the massive creature tried to eat him to both creature up. However, it's called Apple didn't fall for this and he batted up against the cliff as a grenade went off killing him as the skull devil. Finally reached the rest of the crew calling appear to just in time to start with a large Boulder as the crew ran to safety and then the and then thus called overturns. Devil turned his focused to Kong counting on him and gripping his throat with his Jaws called in the skull devil could take them to brutally wrestle puddle and bite each other until the skull down Force Conga to a shipwreck with a blow from his tail where what he had came became entangled to the chains. I think that's a reference to the to of on King Kong film. And with conch subdued in the wreck, the massive skull down will return his Focus to the humans. And as he approached the crew once more the skull Devil's right.	-1.0
Maybe look. I saw a lot of questionable movies when I was a kid and didn't ruin it in screw me. I buy a successful podcast have a fucking blue checkmark.	-1.0
She's like we gotta do it again. She was like this was a genius idea.	1.0
So I just made the pick Debo Samuel. Welcome to Green Bay. If this would work out for me getting a Friday which we will be recapping day 2 of the draft on the packet a podcasts ourselves in just about a month or so for now is picks flying off the board. Now as we are into round three just waiting on a few of the simulation to go. Well. Luckily. I have it on the fast timing so that will move fairly fairly well, And now grimby up at pick 75 names that came off since then notable names Daniel Jones went to Washington to do quarterback Hollywood Brown goes to the Panthers Chase winter, which breaks Jacobs hard everywhere. He goes to the Dolphins Dexter Lawrence to the Browns Charles omena Hue from Texas to the Vikings Kelvin Harmon to the Steelers Michael Dieter first Badger off. The board goes to Philly Caleb McGarry and Taylor at back to back to Houston Trayvon Mullen to the Patriots running back off the Cordero Henderson from Memphis to Philly Dan to the Dallas Cowboys rakia sin quarterback from Temple goes to the Indianapolis Colts David Edwards for another Badger goes to the Chargers Julian love gone to the chief Sandy Isabella to the Saints Jason Stern Burger Patriots get another cell a tight end which really hurts the inside Eric McCoy round 3 to the Cardinals Paris Campbell just went off the board Tyree Jackson Off the board to Jacksonville Blake Cashman off the board in a Rasta, whatever. And him to Tampa Bay last pick made was the Andre Walker Edge from Georgia to the Buffalo Bills. So one Thornhill still out there at 75. So the rock in the podium, I read it.	1.0
You're great. Keep it together. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard. That's that's where you're drawing the boundaries of the about the fact that their hurtling through space and freezing apartment of might be different maybe SP gravity's like 400, but then it seems like the gravity for other occasions like when he's running does it look like it looks like it's the same gravity as Earth. Okay. So let me let me address this from not a physics. We're not going to talk about Gravity of planets like that has some factor into it. Like it's like different different races to so like there's there's like so you're talking about the main character the Mandalorian the guy on his armor. So like 'hey, so the lure is that he mandalorians never take off their armor basically like so he's used to that so he's probably like pretty strong, you know,	1.0
It's good for her but Thanksgiving was so late. Like it was the last week of the month, which normally is not maybe not normally know sometimes it's earlier. Sometimes it falls on like the 23rd or something, right? So the 28th is someone who wants I think was a 2087.	-1.0

It makes me better at loving money fast. Yeah another great question and the way you opened up his body him and asked us to tapping of your left foot and he's on fire any at the moment scoring all those schools, but he's got a The the balls coming in.	1.0
Yeah, and I think that's something that I would encourage like more Christians to think. about is that like is it possible that these people that do have a good amount of self-worth and that are happy and fulfilled in their life and you know are truly living like enjoy like is it necessary for you to then go and like tear that down to try to like put your belief system on them like you could be causing more her and more harm and I honestly think that that kind of is what happened when I was 12 like I was such a happy The little girl and like that didn't obviously go away overnight, but it was like I didn't necessarily like need these messages that they were telling me and they didn't they didn't help like they didn't make me feel better necessarily but I mean a lot of this like analyzing has come since I've left like, I don't want people to think that like I was miserable for 10 years because I wasn't like I still liked my time as a Christian, but it's just looking back. It's like, I don't know if I would Choose that again.	1.0

So the two the three names actually that caught my attention. We're Darius Slayton Connor McGovern and then there was another receiver in their mouths Boykin. Excuse me. So both Boykin and Slayton are guys that have Packers I can guarantee you're going to be in love with they blow the thresholds out of the water. I'm looking at the position though, and it's starting to get a little log jammed with a selection of Depot Samuel. Connor McGovern is a guy that I would be looking at in this area and this part of the draft solid solid player, you know, he's a little bit developmental but that's what you're getting in the fourth round. I think that's exactly what they're looking for in their lineman right now. Not only that he fits what they're looking fits their thresholds with the four five seven short shuttle and a 7-6 6-3 cone. Obviously, he fits the size. So I think Connor McGovern is the selection for me here Joel Marino talked about his ability to play in a Zone. Out and also has some lateral Mobility. So I think he fits with the Packers going to try and do in the Run game very well and then you can try and teach him to coach him up. I should say in the passing game. And so I think that Connor McGovern is the selection for me here.	1.0
Yeah, and it's not no. No, you didn't do anything wrong.	1.0
It's ER it's pretty far but we were able to split it up under like three or four nights and we just kind of we like visiting these little museums and the bread make a nigga was fun out of it was and the car that I had like a Scion at the time. I'm and like that thing was just wheelie and all the way on wait a minute. Yeah, did we know that we both had Saiyans at one point? What was it? I had a Scion tC. Yeah, he's black TC. I had a black XP. That's why I don't think I don't think we've ever talked about this. I don't think we have we'll do a whole episode on silent. They don't even make them anymore. Mine was basically a Pepsi can on Wheels is what I kind of thought of it was a hollow a scar Paolo. I liked that. It was a hollow car basically, so now he was cool. So at the time, you know, I moved out Here I didn't have a plan on the way out. I did apply for a job at Backcountry.com and a lot of my friends at the time work there as well. And I was thinking, you know, I'll just apply and I'll work in the call center. You know, right? I'll talk gear. I know gear I ride for companies. This is great yadda. And on the drive out. I actually about six hours away. I got a call and I got the job. He does awesome. So that was really cool. And at the time a job was a job. I was just going to snowboard and I always had film and you know video to you. No lie back on it in case something didn't work out. Which was really really cool. So I don't feel like in school. I learned as much as I could have. Yeah, but I knew once I started going in the right field and working for people that I could keep developing those skills, right? So what was really cool about Backcountry as is I was there for two months and I get an email about job openings via email like internal and one of the jobs was for video and I'm like, okay, they're building out a new video program. This is great. This is this is a big opportunity for me. I apply instantly boom. I don't hear back for a month I hit. Back, I'm like, there's no way I got this but it's worth.	1.0

If you have just a bookcase and small children that are just pulling books off the shelf or whatever, maybe move that bookcase to about bedroom. That's what we that's what we did at our old house. We had the bookcase out front and it became kind of a mess now. It's in a bedroom. The kids are older. They're not scattering the books as much but it's still just saves time when straightening the living room that you're not just worried. I'm not just worried about are these books You know lined up correctly or something. They can be a little bit in perfect. If they're just in a child's room as long as the child is happy with how they're organized. You see what I'm saying? So if there's a problem with clutter in your living room, you met our family room. You may want to consider downsizing as far as putting some things somewhere else and just keeping that room a little bit more sparse.	-1.0

Paperwork really before the season started you had to get all of your employment forms and certifications done. Now that you have your team chosen, there are a few more paperwork tasks, which you should do. This is a time when you can be creative. So embrace the fun that comes with coaching. If you're not the creative type. However, you can choose to find some of these items online and save yourself the time regardless of your coaching philosophy. You'll need to be clear about at least one topic during the season team rules while discipline is disgusting. A little later on discipline should only happen after team rules are broken after reading the discipline section create a list of your team rules and print out enough to give to each player and also to distribute to families at your first meeting together this way everyone knows what is expected of them and it's not caught off guard when you take disciplinary action, if you have different levels or kinds of discipline depending on the rule, which is broken list that out as well. Not only will this help deter rule-breaking, but it will also help you. A consistent once you've created your team rules, you need to hand them out to your players while you could just give the paper to each girl and hope she at least keeps it somewhere in her gym bag. I prefer to hand out team rules in a folder which I customized for each player. This could be as simple as writing their name and number in the top right-hand corner. You could get a little more crafty if that's what you're into and add stickers quotes drawings Etc on their folder. It might also be fun to have a folder decorating station at the beginning of this year. Meetings to keep the players entertained while you talk to the families younger players will probably appreciate this more but the right group of high schoolers might enjoy it just as much so why hand out folders when all you're doing is handing out team rules folder is generally more sturdy than the paper which will likely end up crumpled at the bottom of their bag next to a rogue sock which are not even sure is there's but now you have a safe place for other papers to go if needed say you're traveling for a tournament and want to hand out the information at practice. You'll be safe in the folder. Maybe you want to create a habit of writing down team and personal goals before each match that can go on the folder to you're helping yourself in the long run by giving them a safe place to store anything you think is important enough to print out and give to them later on in this book will look at keeping stats for your team in that chapter. I will give you tons of reasons to implement stat tracking in the beginning of your season, but I want to give you a tool now which will help you use stats for each individual on your team. Not just at the broad. Level if you search hard enough online, you can download a personal stat tracker for your players. This encourages one-on-one discussions with your players. If you have the time, but can also be an easy way to communicate about their individual performance and growth without having to use practice time to have these meetings. If you'd prefer to create your own personal stattrak or consider including the following spaces to communicate growth over the season serving percentage passing percentage setting percentage attacking percentage block. Aces assist digs and notes to demonstrate growth. I like to show the team and average percentage not including the most recent match or tournament. Then I have a column with the same stats, but for only the most recent match or tournament, this will show the players how their most recent performance Stacks up against their previous performance during my second year of coaching. I also included the team percentages so they could see where they were in relation to everyone else on the team. I decided to take the stat off of the form itself. Elf and instead share these numbers verbally team stats are a good measure which you should definitely track but you're adding insult to injury when someone realizes they're dragging down the team passing percentage every tournament. They'll know when you announce team stats. There's no reason to include it on their personal stat tracker. If you're going to have meetings after every competition to discuss individual progress, you can give players one sheet, which they can use all years track their stats if you prefer to hand out stats and only have meetings when necessary I Handing out a new sheet after every match or tournament one word of caution on personal stat trackers. Your players can take these very literally and the self-confidence of younger players, especially may suffer communicate with your team that they are a learning tool and cannot capture everything which a player brings to the team enthusiasm and teamwork are just as important, but those are hard to measure add positive comments in the notes section to discuss ways in which a player contributed that is not made obvious by the stats. Building trust and culture remember in the very beginning when I said that some parts of this book will have a greater impact on your season than others. Well, this is one of those areas and it is major right behind your coaching philosophy is your ability to build a positive and productive team culture and while coaching philosophy and culture are of the utmost importance. Your influence will not extend as far as you hope without first building trust to start. Let's talk about trust we all know in our gut when Trust someone or not, but what behaviors actually generate trust think back to your former coaches. Were you ever told you're going to get a lot of playing time today only to sit the bench like always or have you ever gone back to serve only to see your coach panic and call for a substitution, even though they weren't sure who they were going to put in or have you ever asked your coach about playing a new position or trying a new play been told? Yes, and then never get the opportunity these experiences likely deteriorated your trust in. Your coach and impacted your commitment to the team and their goals while it occasionally happens breaking promises to your players or not being prepared for certain situations on a regular basis is one of the quickest ways to fail as a leader of your team. So how do you build and maintain trust for starters? No your coaching philosophy. If you haven't taken the time yet go back to chapter 1 and do this now. This will show you your true coaching personality when you understand that you can create policies around. Values which you are more likely to follow even during high intensity and high-stress situations. How do you do that? It's mostly self-monitoring want to brighten someones day by telling them that they're going to get more playing time. Just don't even if your intention is to get them in don't tell them this a few hours before the match when you're still uncertain of all the playing conditions do they need a heads up? Yes, but only when you know for sure that they're going in not one you think it would be nice if you could get them more playing time. Or if they want to try a new position and you think the time is right let them know before I match so they can warm up in that position. Don't think you'll get them in need them in their regular position. Just tell them that delivering bad or unwanted news is hard. But if your players know that you're being honest with them the trust will build some pointers don't over promise if the answer is no say no explain decisions. If the situation calls for an explanation fight the urge to explain decisions other Eyes say what you mean follow through with promises. If you fail to meet a promise sincerely apologize behind only your coaching philosophy and Trust building team culture is one of the foundations of the Season which you need to make a priority your culture is essentially a mixture of the most dominant personalities on your team and your values in coaching volleyball and girls, especially it's important to maintain a positive and supportive culture.	1.0
I'm not going to sing a lot Bennett but a lot of the time it is you never did. No you are right, but those two are and Cody the Freer and natural with the ball at the fit. They're all they're all midfielders. So it's natural that we are going to retain possession better under distribution is going to be better. I mean the out ball is a lot better, especially Block then Duncan part of his leftovers, right? So yeah, I think we've adjusted seamlessly tight body's not even not even gone but even got he's got to come back straight to the team.	0.0
Yeah, so as I mentioned before it's it's truly truly the heart. Work has been done by Justice Mesquita. I kind of just piggybacked off of him and but basically a couple years ago, he did a thorough study and evaluated the prospects that Green Bay tends to draft and the guys that they tend to drift towards when they're making their selections and I can honestly tell you they draft athletes for the most part. It's every single one of the positions has a couple thresholds, but they're pretty much all inclusive of basically speed agility and size depending on the position, but pretty much this is Speed and Agility. That's really all they're looking for. They don't care about strength. They don't care about a lot of other characteristics. I think quarterback offensive line and defensive back are and wide receiver. Those are the ones where they care about size for defensive line and Edge. There's this couple special calculations called. Oh my goodness. They're the basically their agility and speed calculations. The exact name of the calculations escaping me. It's not like a super well-known one. But if you ever want to know just reach out to me and I'll do a little bit of digging and I have it in my notes the gentleman who originated the formula, but basically there's a formula that calculates agility and speed using their three-cone time 40-yard dash their height and their weight and their certain threats certain thresholds that have been met in the past and certain thresholds that were looking for moving forward, especially with the Packers needing Edge help. Till I would say that they still need Edge help, you know, it's a good tool to look at and it's been a pretty good indicator and I know Justice Mesquita, he knows its edges, you know, he puts out those Force players every year. So they're pretty root pretty good indicators of relative success in the so I'm very excited to just keep updating it and updating it weekly currently with pro day numbers as new players who didn't test that the combine or players just who are improving on there. Numbers in general I'm pretty excited for what it's become and what it's growing into and definitely going to keep continuing this every year as long as the thresholds are going to hold true. Which last year. I think it was like seven seven of the players seven of the draft picks last year fell Within These thresholds, so I'm pretty excited for how predictive it was last year and what it might indicate this year.	1.0

How did that come about that came about when my son was two something happened one night when I came home from work that made me question whether growing up without a father had crept into my father Hood, which is something I never thought about, you know, because I have two other kids, you know, two daughters and so that you know, I was kicking around the idea. That year. I think I kind of rolled out some chapters and I just didn't get to it, you know, and then like a few years ago. I just like I just really need to get this out. So I started writing to explore this question. Like I did Growing Up Without a father creep into my fatherhood and you know halfway through I felt like maybe my story could be a Thule inspiration to others that have similar backgrounds. The things that nature or maybe I don't know maybe it can help. So I you know, I finished finished the book. I decided to self-publish it which is crazy not the recommended thing. But um, you know, and I put it out there and I think you know, it's really getting it was a great run to have those conversations amongst men and women but specifically amongst men within our community about fatherhood and and the responsibilities of the mail, you know, and I black families and it I actually was inspired because a lot of solid father's out there's a lot of young Brothers is you know, they they don't have all the money in the world. They might not have the highest education but then the kids lives and they're trying to make it happen.	-1.0

Yeah. Yeah around that was just so uncomfortable. Yeah.	-1.0
I wish you told me that too now because we do our research here now, you know, we do have a clip of you rapping, right? All right, it's what you want a wolf pack. We're gonna play your verse right now. Remember that verse and you remember that whole yeah, I remember that time.	1.0

So anything kind of what you're saying to you like if you're Having you know a lot of anxiety and you're just not feeling great. I kind of like to say you have to give yourself a fighting chance. So I mean I noticed when I'm eating really poorly and I'm not working out and I'm just like I guess what's one more pint of ice cream and that's me and hurt me and Fountain Coke. Yeah, like you just you just feel like gross and I think I kind of made the decision last week and then of course, I got my wisdom teeth out this week. So I've kind of been knocked down but um, I'm Like you know what? Okay, I I'm probably never going to be the same size. I was before I had kids and that's fine. And but I need to give myself the best chance that I can so I'm going to drink water. I'm going to exercise even if like 30 minutes. And so last year I did an Ironman Triathlon, which released 1.2 miles Swim 56-mile Bike and then a half marathon. So for me to sit here and go. Oh, I'm going to walk for 30 minutes. It's like kind of like a In the face to myself because it's like are you kidding me right now? Like you just did this a tower of n but that's what I can do right now. And so that's what I'm going to do. And those little habits are going to build on top of each other and then you're going to get stronger and grow and yeah, and so I think part of it too is you have to give yourself the best possible shot that you can but that kind of brings up like self-sabotage. I know I do that. I'm so good at that where it's like, you know, I'll do a way. Weight loss challenge or something and I'll get so close, but I'm like, I'm not going to make it so I'm just gonna gain ten pounds anyways, and like why do I do that?	1.0
Pain that I feel like they have a significant influence on like the pricing side of things right? It's because that's what I'm wondering the operation, right? So in declaring company the parent company kind of controls the dislike the monetary side of you think any company or like any of the subs, right? So I feel like it's definitely an EA thing like even with a discount like the if you have like EA access origins or whatever you can get 10% discount, but even then that's like still a lot of money. Yeah. Spend on a gun skin that you probably won't be using for the full game. I think that they'd still I think that they need to kind of drop the price a little bit if they want to make more but did you hear that? They made apparently 92 million dollars. Yeah before the battle path. I was like who's buying stuff in the store?	-1.0

Okay, so we need to talk about that. This is what I'm so funny because I had completely forgot that happen. But that is actually how I think I got to know you and so I really do think that that was the turning point because that's when people are like Lenin he doesn't even like the show he just loves staring. Why would they invite him on and I remember cuz the very first guest Was Not Another Teen Wolf podcast test and then they had the Argent crew then I forget who was on after that. It was an artist was it not dot but Kendra. Okay. I can't remember her artist named Klaus some Kendrick laws something like that. It's like oh, yeah, right and it was all leaning very much one way. And so when there was kind of, you know thoughts of like, oh, let's have someone who's going Hysteric on like who are they going to choose? Who are they going to choose? I don't know that people were talking about it. But I think at that point that's when you kind of start with like, you know, I was kind of told XYZ and that's kind of where that all sparked it, but that's hilarious. I completely forgot about that.	1.0

I would you know again, I would love to give pennant Kevin the benefit of the doubt because certainly I would think that he would realize he was abandoned by everybody around the farm. Plus he found out where everything that the farm was up to amass enough to make you reconsider your actions. Like why was I supporting this guy that was going to carve out my body parts to sell to somebody else and then I just abandon everything and just took off in the middle of the night deliberately leaving me behind. Yeah, especially because he Frank says you were Left behind because they didn't think you could be trusted and yet there was no that Kevin did at the end of last season that even gave you the slightest impression.	1.0

to be the last of his kind and this is seen and in the comic book known as Skull Island berth of column and mentioned by Hank Marlowe and remains of advantage of the deceased parents are called receipt of the skull crawlers territory of the movie and given that there are no dinosaurs in the movie and that the remains are President Scholars territory is possible that dinosaurs Old Scotland if they were once present there may have been wiped out by the skull crawlers or or something else that some unknown event prior to the film and During the production of the film The reason why there were no dinosaurs in the movie besides Triceratops skull was because it was because Jordan Valle de vocht Roberts thought that Jurassic world was still fresh in everyone's mind and praises and Praises Peter Jackson for for doing a decent job for making King Kong fight of earwax and in 2005 version, so he did it. So he tried to make up completely such make them look completely made-up creatures in the film, but the but the but the skull cause I got a pretty good crawling Bo It's like they reach their it's like they reach their arms around and they step they can also fall over pretty easily.

You've got to figure out what it is that actually makes you feel alive. And if you understand that the game that you're playing is actually a game of brain chemistry and that nothing else matters. There's no objective truth. There's no one path to Glory. There's no one life for you to live. There's only the subjective truth that thing inside you that gut instinct that voice that Whispers to you. You've got to learn to trust that you've got to learn to trust it by building it up. You've got to The Trusted by taking actions and gut checking yourself and asking is that me is that who I want to be or is that somebody else cultural voice my parents my lover whatever trying to speak through me and his Harley Davidson said when writing a story of your life, don't let anyone else hold the pen. So right now ask yourself. He's writing your story. Is it you are you really listening to the voice in your head? Are you looking at and listening? Living by the things that give you the chills or are you trying to live a life that somebody else wants for you? And remember when you think about that question what William James said act as if what you do matters because it does even if for nobody else every step you take every thought that you were allowed to permeate your mind everything you obsess about your dreams the things that you want the hopes that you spend your time.

I think we spoke to a few race directors on this podcast and I just I always I would I don't envy their position when the weather gets really hot and about There's been some races here in Adelaide with it. The race had to be cancelled when the temperature got I think it was forecast to be over 35 degrees. And that was this particular race. That was the cutoff point. When is that? We can't do it and people give it and I'm really good friends with this particular race director in the the cops. A lot of grief when he has to cancel the race, you know every yeah. Yeah, so I don't know why God have you ever been in a race where the weather has been so I mean obviously on the weekend, maybe go into more detail about that you drink 17 liters of water people suffered.

Yeah to me now. Hard parts of a run but I also think you just have to I think it's worse if you try and push the negativity away like just kind of embrace and then it will pass. Yeah, allow yourself to feel allow yourself to cry like I cried on the weekend. I was yeah, I had my low point but then once you get that out of your system pick up again, yeah, yeah.	1.0
I would do 6040 60/40 I think 60% diet 40% workout. I think you know you do have to work hard to to get like you can't just you know, it's a good combination of both. I just say I would put 60/40 because I feel like a lot of people when it's January 1st. The very first question that they asked for that the devil's tell themselves is I got to go to the gym. They're not they're not thinking I gotta save calories or I gotta watch my eat my food just like I gotta go too. Like a lot of times when people are broke their like I got to find more ways to make money right now. You have to find ways to decrease your expenses. I focus on what you can control first, right? And so it's just really about detaching yourself keeping track. You know, I think having the ability what one of my mentors told me what doesn't get measured does not get improved. You have to have some type of Quantified measurement so that way okay. It's a Earth to see this time, how can I get a B next time How can I get a right? So for people track a calories while your food out for not waiting some of your food out in your kind of just estimating that can only take you so far but honestly once you get in the habit of doing so keep things simple prep your meals I just have a whole bunch of foods, you know ready in the fridge. That way you don't have to eat things that you know overload on things that are healthy for you now and you can still have a good time like you don't have to, you know, go be all in. Have to be too extreme like find a balance, you know, enjoy your life suposed to be a speed round.	1.0
All right, I hate folding clothes and doing laundry and I'll bring a lot of times what happens is will bring the laundry up and the basket just sits there full of clothes like a lot of people dump him on a chair on the bed and then just move them to the floor and it was just then eventually it's like you need to rewash them. They're so rich Wrinkled. So AE Dimock says changing betting after those fucking idiots piss themselves, which is another twist. So if you like wake up and we'll let your kid gets sick or pees himself and you have to like change sheets or like do laundry in the middle the night that sucks.	-1.0

Even if your room isn't completely tidied up or whatever. Just making the bed makes a big difference and a lot of times that's kind of the springboard to get your room clean. Once you see your med Bay, once you see your bed made it leads to other cleaning. Like putting clothes in the hamper putting shoes away clearing clutter from the nightstands. And then of course the bonus chores in a bedroom or just like the living areas. Maybe you need to clean a sliding glass door or wipe down a windowsill. Maybe you need to remove clutter. I often need to remove clutter from our bedroom dresser. We tend to accumulate stuff. So from time to time, I need to put those items away where they go. I think everybody has a surface in their house that attracts clutter. For me one of them is definitely the kitchen island is one and then the master dresser is one.	-1.0

I actually have three more things to bring up but we'll take turns I Eric.	1.0
That was the moment. I could feel that shift within me as I realized the truth the truth that you don't have to prove. No one has no one is born having to proof if they're good enough or not. We are all born the fact that we are born the fact that we exist makes us good enough. We are always already always will be good enough. We are all special. We are all completely special does not matter if you have certain abilities or not doesn't matter if you failed a billion times in your past. You will always be special but everybody is special. So nobody is extra special special or any less special than anybody else no matter which Soul was human what color how tall you are how big you are how small you are it don't matter. And so, you know I go that was a big shift for me that realization.	1.0
I'm stupid and it doesn't you are stupid. So yeah and is because of all the homework I had to do all the homework made you stupid exactly and so but what they do is anything they give them periods in school. They let them finish their homework and if they don't finish it, they have to finish it home, right? Okay.	-1.0
Let's do the same thing, but I'm actually Nick in the head or different. I was a young white. I'm thinking Mexico. You know, I was never supposed to be pretty lyrics so now you just rest them all.

This could also hit that the skull crawlers are are unbelievably malevolent as take Marlo calls some nasty and mean as hell as the apex predators of Skull Island Skull crawlers are fearsome and deadly in battle. Usually their Jaws full of razor sharp. Teeth is the primary weapons and they hold their own against opponents such as Kong as they're able to withstand the blows and public of the ape and then the serpent like tails are used for swatting or for wrapping around an opponent during combat.	1.0

actually some you know dense stuff behind him and it's very sad though to see abuse though, you know it is but then this feel like him turn my head or special segment here for a moment boy. It's okay, but it also brings it back to my frustration at times of this show where we get to see Reggie Evans kind of Ferris Bueller moment or I like Cameron. I'm sorry, he's camera moment from Ferris Bueller work takes it out on his dad's car because they never pay them any attention. Right and that's how he's going to show them and so Reggie doesn't same thing with the baseball bat to his dad's prized car and then we just cut to later where it's are cheating with Richie. Well, you know it started as talking like I think I rather would have seen that scene.	-1.0
Big fox big facts, so there you go people still no no concrete release date yet. But again, we will keep you all updated on adventures during this 3 because that is definitely my most anticipated project of this year so far. Let's get into the album reviews. We have one album that we are going to review today and that is going to be offset father of four now all set as head of hair. The 2018 the man has been getting it be for people. He got married secretly. He had a child with cardi B and he's been in his share of scandals. Not only did he get into some beef with with Chris Brown. Soulja Boy is going to come at them a little bit. And of course the whole cheating scandal which had pretty much everybody who was a cardi B fan on his head and saying that he was piece of shit and all that stuff. He was supposed to actually release his album last year. Here but ended up getting pushed back and I'm sure that it got pushed back because of all the scandals that he just had to try to salvage his relationship him and cardi end up getting separated for a little bit. But now they're back together taking care of the child and looks like they're being a family and they for the most part gotten through all of that stuff because that's what people when you love somebody. That's what you do. You got to fight to keep your girl and when he ended up bringing out the project, you know, The Breakfast Club and actually respected what he said on the interview, it seems like he's He's evolved and reflected a lot. I know that everybody is Presley these blind fans and want to just automatically condemn somebody if they do one bad thing or they do a couple bad things. But at the end of the day that's his wife, and that's that's his baby mamas life or his wife's like that ain't your life. So who are you to judge when you're on the outside looking in like that's not your thing that you have to go through and it seemed like all say realize that it specially in their Breakfast Club interview and on this album it. Definitely reflected a lot of like what he was going through. He definitely had multiple songs about his children about cardi situation. He apologized and million times on it and it seemed like he actually wants to be a better husband and a better a better father to his the newborn and his other three kids that he had with his other baby mamas now, obviously as far as talent wise talent and celebrity wise, I don't think we know any of them compared to cardi B and even if they did I'm pretty sure cars if he's gonna The biggest baby mama at all I know but but they're still you know, not to not to discredit any other any other baby mamas we had children with but obviously he you know loves all of them just the same and I just think that he's overall just grew as a person which people can do so for this particular album has 16 songs total features Big rule. Shout out to be a group. That's definitely a huge huge thing and Atlanta Jayco Jay Cole been doing a lot of features. I'm actually very Why did he just keep jumping on features? So that's that's pretty well gonna yeah, see low on here Travis guy 21 Savage cardi B. Quavo and Gucci Mane and I will say my favorite songs from this album would be quarter. Millie clout wild wild west and how did I get here? Now as far as this album compared to the other solo albums by takeoff and quavo. I gotta say that I think offsets out. Was the best I would have we said that that was going to happen. Yeah, but I think that we were a little bit worried just because when take off sound came out that was it was very underwhelming. So a lot of people like man, why don't all says I was gonna be but I think that again he had the best album after listening to it. I think he has some really good features. I think that in and this might be a hot take here is might be unpopular opinion. I think the offset out of the Migos is probably the most versatile. Especially after hearing this album. I thought that quavo initially was quavo the hood guy and you know, he he's a good songwriter or whatever. He definitely definitely rent some songs first Ojai name artist, but I think that quavo just kind of got to take a step back because quavo really isn't the lyrical dude. I think they offset is like takeoff and quavo mixing the one I think that he has a bigger a bigger bigger repertoire that Really propels him above his other counterparts and I think they really showed on this album, especially with the features. I didn't find one feature to be like out of place or sound weird North Star was CeeLo Green CeeLo. Green killed that obviously had big Ruban the very first song Father for J. Cole killed and on. How did I get here? Cardi B actually think our DB I'll wrap them which is funny on clout. I think the party be gonna kill - I would like, whoa, I'll say whoa. This is gotta is kind of	1.0

So in order to find security in God, you need to stop finding Security in everything else right and worrying about everything else will how is this going to happen? How did it end like stop wrestling against God and let him show you who he is right in chapter 15 Abraham and Abraham believed the Lord and the Lord counted him righteous because Of his faith not by his Good Deeds, but by his belief in who God is and and that he would be faith that God would be faithful in his promise right not worrying about the details of when just acting in obedience and being faithful to God when we ask God for something and have to wait we can be tempted to take matters into our own hands and then it interferes with God's plans. Right? Like I know for sure and I call this like a detour Because I opened a studio when I knew I rushed into it. God was not calling me to that at all II like instantly had anxiety. I was stressed like in those things do not come from the Lord right? But this was early in my faith when I did man when I was just striving for achievements and I thought I had to earn God's love. I thought I had to like like accomplish things in order to earn his Van earned his blessings, right? I took matters into my own hands all the time all the time. I wasn't allowing myself to be still it because I really didn't truly know who God was because I wasn't in in deep relationship with him because I was trying to be in control of everything.	1.0
Is that happen? Yeah, so it's good. It's so we had lots of training IP.	1.0
Honestly, the thing that saves Us episode was just all over in general. His character was great. I like I love the whole Oliver's like Locker man thing is adorable. Yeah and iconic and I think I found his Hannah Montana dedication kind of	1.0

You need it to look nice and you need and some of your Decor does need to be three-dimensional, you know, it's not all just pictures on the walls, but for the most part that's I decorate pictures on the walls throw pillows, maybe a plant or a framed picture on a Surface but I don't mind having a few knickknacks. And like I said, I need something in that certain space just to kind of fill it and give the room a little bit more Dimension and balance but you know definitely have a minimalist approach though.	1.0
understand	1.0
I'm talking just the cheap celery that's still kind of, you know, all together.	-1.0
Do you say someth or oh, I just think I think you're absolutely right, but it's I think it's a lot like the horse deal every day more and more. We're bucking females. And and I think you're right. I think you could breed, you know some Superstar stuff and have a pretty good shot, but I think	1.0

It's okay good I can I say something. It really is sad to come home from the Working Day and remove my suit to put on something that looks like I've been lounging around.	1.0
Okay, go next one much less disgusting question.	-1.0
Right? No problem is too complicated for God if you're willing to let him help. But that's it's so hard to admit our wrongs especially when were angry or were sitting waiting for a promise from God and we're just were anxious or feeling overwhelmed. I mean, I know I get so antsy in the waiting period but that's when we start to take take things into our own hands.	-1.0
So I I say a minimalist approach, but I'm not just telling you to have hardly anything in the room.	-1.0
Yeah, you're my kid that I didn't even know about Mmm, I still think that's it seems weird that we've got a kid that is both a half-brother to book Betty and Jughead. Yep.	1.0
You know what I mean? Like, I don't know that she was necessarily trying to do it illusion. I would just say, you know, it's statuesque or has a syllable. I'm referring to Latrice has thanked because I don't know that she was trying to do nude illusion. I think that was just the the colors that she chose like, I don't think that that's what they had in the band. Yeah. Exactly and sometimes you're working with this what's in the bin so she may have just been working with what was in the bin Monet her consistent Runway has always been this and I've seen it since episode one is the detail. Yeah. She has she has time like if you see this on the 4K that the shoulder Pat is completely Stone everything from head to toe is completely stoned no spots the details though. She had time. I'm she was waiting for it. This was another one that like Trinity that I was like, I like it. I don't love it. But I will say this I loved her makeup. I think that might be the best makeup. She's done seeing her is that she's not choking cares. Great. Yeah.	1.0
That's what your point was caused because he's like you already are from him and you fat shit.	-1.0
You get all this data from all these retailers and that makes you sort of Target better. And yeah, so that's don't talk to that. For those not already in the no network effect is when the more people use something the better the product becomes for example. Google is a popular search engine. So more people tend to use it and the more people who use it the better the search results it gives because Google is learning from every single user and this is one of the reasons why it is so hard to knock off big tech companies. They have such a massive Head Start in refining their product.	1.0
Thank you. So this is episode.	1.0

I don't know if that's factual or not. So I'm going to have to back it up with a second source, and of course. It's the only thing those rumors really successfully did was raise the bar to an unobtainable level for the enhancing these Lindor Terry Scott sessions. So now anything that's not a complete highway robbery by the tribe, which the rumors that were out there. Absolutely were you and I have talked in this podcast that we don't know if the Dodgers straight up would do Lindor for Lux and if that was presented to you or I I think I would very strongly consider accepting that offer if I'm the Indians. Yet the offer was Luxe plus six other seven other nine other guys that were really really talented. So and in really nice lot money, of course and really didn't pass the smell test, but it did make for a fun at least 20 minutes or so of taunting you and whether or not I was actually being factual or not because I sent you the tweet and the Tweet went along with the build antonetti a statue Now text which if you receive both you Have understood my sarcasm, but when you didn't get the Tweet part of the text because you're in the air you only got the text message. So then that's initially all you get and then what I what I sent back was another picture. I think I screenshot of the tweet and try to send it to you that way but that also didn't go through and then I said something else which could have been interpreted as they just made this fantastic trade. So I am glad that I at least cause you at least some mild Panic while you're in there.	-1.0
Yeah, so we should just get right back out and do them and make sure that we're having fun and get away from those. Terrible memories make fun ones.	1.0
So, why would they need you though? 30 have apps right there you have it.	-1.0

How's everybody doing? Just so you know? Alright, so today we want to talk a little bit about Fitness and you know trying to get into getting to healthy habits, but first we just want to introduce you and we just want to have you explain a little bit of you know, how you how you even know us.	1.0
Well, yeah then thank you for that. I you know, I'm I don't know how to respond to that. I appreciate that more than you know, don't get me wrong. I have my share of demons. My closet as well and there are people who know that I can I'm a big believer in in sharing your feelings regardless of what because that's how people get to know you. So yes, I try to be the kindest person possible and I hope that I am especially with students. I always am but let's be honest. We all have our moments right? I definitely want to wear my heart on my sleeve. That's why I have a tattoo of a heart stone on my wrist because I do but no, I really appreciate that more than you know, and and I can't take total credit for For my I guess philosophy or attitude or just believe on this subject it stemmed from well. First of all, my upbringing I was raised by the best parents in the world and completely always surrounded by Family transition that to school. I had some of the best teachers in the world. I was lucky enough to go to a very very small school. So everybody knew everybody, you know your teachers Knew by first middle and last name then your family. I was raised in a kind World, which I think a lot of people our age were and unfortunately, Times have changed like you said times are changing and times are changing in and I'm a big believer that no one was was inherently born as an unkind human being it's something you're taught. It's something that you've experienced. It's what you were surrounded by on a daily basis and my goal. Our goal is to Decatur's should be to reverse that statistics and get it back to you know, I don't know just get the world to be one happy place. I know that sounds so cliche and and cool, but Then moving forward I guess to go back into my philosophy. And reason for this stemmed from a woman who was my mentor teacher and I know I've told this story before on multiple platforms and media devices and want to hear it again.	1.0
For example, I place a high value on aggressiveness during one of my years coaching Club. I took Valentine's Day cards to my girls at a tournament on February 14th.	1.0
Yes. That's what I'm trying to do.	1.0
I mean, I feel like there's probably a reason they hired you. Something about you. They're like that's kind of the quality we're looking for.	1.0

Right, I barely noticed it nine-year-old still just it was just like you had to strap them down. It was hysterical. He was hysterical.	-1.0
I'm excited on it.	1.0
I actually I never got a chance to come in and do the audition. Pasha was doing the audition while I was on tour and then they asked me to just submit a video in and I did that like I've got some stuff with Derek Hough.	-1.0
It's all so yeah, I mean There are so many levels of toxicity with that because you know, that was a huge part of my life really imploded. I started being you know, you and I have this in common where we both had a breakthrough moment where we became very explorative and intellectual and curious about our religion. I left it as well. I didn't I would always say like I was never capable of leaving God or feeling disconnected from my virtual side, but I had to leave the actual building of the church because these things just weren't resonating anymore. And when you're surrounded by people that say every bad thing in your life is happening because of what you're doing wrong. It creates is never ending anxiety and and it's just not true.	-1.0
Oh, yeah, I guess that's true. I don't know why I'm sticking up for the parents. We have kids longer. Okay shit. I just leaked my kid. No stay over there.	1.0
It looks like an absolute bargain us. I think I think you can come and 30 million for him.	1.0
I'm like, I'm also the idiot. Let's get started.	-1.0
10 goals in his last season for us some names of central midfielder who had since then that could even rival also barred by the Premier League Lee Evans and your lie ever told shovel Michael Jacobs who was involved in this exercise is only whole light to medium actually.	1.0
Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone and forcing yourself into something that's just not meant to be. Hmm. So I do believe it's up to the person to push themselves in a way where it still feels like overall. There's a positive benefit here, right? Because sometimes exercise does push us and it you don't always feel great and you should push yourself, but if you I truly think if you are tuned into yourself in a in a profound way. You can tell what's an exercise that is like comfortably pushing you to be better and stronger and something that's actually just going to hurt you or is just not right for your body. So again, it's up for each person to decide what what that is. I love that. I really love that.	1.0
More too far and we could have a business but what was her reaction?	0.0
Be alright, it's being it's been an example to indict and just letting your students watch you WEA know wholeheartedly these kids mimic every single thing we do. So imagine if if you smiled and said hello to every person across your path, you know, we talked to think in one of the previous episodes about getting kids to to learn the names of other staff members, right? And I mean, that's something that could be considered a kind act when you can call someone by name rather than just just waving or giving a head nod, you know, so that's a simple step. Inclusion is another big one and I don't mean on the the classroom inclusion of you know, different grade levels and abilities and it just including people in your everyday conversations. I just think that's an important lesson we can teach to all kids that we include people who might not feel included you'll see that in bullying statistics all the time. What if you know, what if what if what if one person had someone sit with him at lunch or that one person that someone sits on the playground so kindness as a whole can be stretched in Seoul The different directions and so many philosophies and so many ideas or things but it doesn't have to be the purchase of an item or an idea that your intently doing. It just just just be a good human being, you know, the way that the way that you would want to be treated, right?	1.0
So just some random thoughts on how I get comfortable to clean, but the less clothing that I have on the better. Basically, let's see taking out the kitchen trash. That's something that I often do to make sure that my house is smelling good we take out the trash every day. We don't live in an area where they have the same. Separate recycle bins.	1.0
You know, what wake me up when she's 13.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, let's go first I got to think of a good one. I got one.	1.0
Yeah, if you have a trio of Thornhill Amos and then Josh Jones kind of up in the Box. I think you're in good shape. So we'll go with Juan Thornhill there and there he goes Dawson noxious went off the board Savage off the board. Am IA hooker to the Dolphins. So the Dolphins taking all of my topics Damien Harris off the board. Renault Ren from Arizona State to the Titans for you, drew Sammy off the board mile Sanders to the Texans Riley Ridley to the Lions. The hell warring a good tight end of the Cowboys JSA a white side to the Chargers. as we slowly work our way through round three max Crosby Edge from Eastern Michigan to the Jaguars is looking for notable names. This was Anthony Nelson final pick of the round to the Ravens as we're now in round 4, so we have two more picks left in this Mock. And in this podcast David Montgomery just went to the Buccaneers if this if this simulation were to hold So Packers, I'll pick one 14. Last pic was Will Harris from Boston College. So top five I'll go top 10 players. I'm getting later in the in the draft process. Number one Prospect out. There is Miles Boykin from Notre Dame wide receiver Josh Oliver from San Jose State tight end is the second top prospect. Jajuan Johnson safety from Miami Dairy is Slayton from Auburn wide receiver Connor McGovern Guard from Penn State. Antoine Wesley from Texas Tech treyvion Williams from Texas A&M a running back Jacoby Myers from NC State and Dennis daily from South Carolina and offensive tackle are the top prospects on the board according to the draft networks predictive board.	1.0
Yeah in the middle o is apply everything could probably still do a job for us now with Has Kevin McDonald for your class? He watched her brilliant. You think Kevin MacDonald could play in this County? Yeah, you do a job for us.	1.0
Yeah, which was terrible. We saw it and I thought like it was some some your dad that put it up and everyone was just getting smashed on super box. I'll go to here who's had one Supermarket told are going I searched pitch inspection on Twitter and it was just all these people tagging Spears and Joe Edwards asking in terms of pitch him inspection and said that they spoke to the locals about it and I just laughed it off so District, this is actually gonna be used to this at that time here.	-1.0
It's nice to see their body just like a drop down exactly one thing that I learned in one of my games if if you and the opponent is using the zip line and same time going the opposite directions. He will both just Bonk each other and fall to your death. Really? Yeah. That's awesome. I hopped on the zipline and I'm heading over there and this guy like had a gun. I didn't have a gun. I was just going to go over there and just Punch right died but he and I didn't know why I didn't shoot. He just hopped on the zipline and came straight at me and we both like a bumped into each other and fell to her death. So maybe I got the kill so I was kind of happy with that right you like I'll take it.	1.0
I just want me before Six or seven days absolutely Macedonian got as well, isn't it? That's what they'll go.	0.0
Joking Foley was amazing.	1.0
I think it's hard for me to say. Terms of buying a whole furniture package because they're I don't imagine they would be many people out there who would have no furniture to begin with maybe they just want to replace their lounge or their coffee table. That's why I think accessories are a lot easier to replace in a room as opposed to replacing your whole bed and bedside tables but also from where I'm coming from because I'm a regional person that shipping for me. He is very expensive. So I don't offer shipping for my bedroom packages. You would need to be a local to pick them up because shipping is just too expensive. I think probably in the cities the bedroom packages would probably work and be a bit more in demand. But yeah, it's hard. It's hard for me to say.	-1.0
Oh my God. I'm worried. If Tim says it's difficult.	-1.0
Wow. Well story so give her her musical background your musical background. How can we see a collab album?	1.0
Well, I mean the difficulty I don't see the difficulty there. That's not come from the fact that the others would be performing better by the Blazing their own currencies, but what they do is just to redistribute existing resources. Thibault, the politically well connected to the detriment of the others the problem I think for for this is ordinarily right for a country that has a sound o better money that other countries right now we've been doing for 10 years now, we've made great efforts to make sure that Swiss franc the British pound Euro and the American dollar becoming more is the same thing as really very few changes. No many just options that we exchange rates and so on but let's say if you have known and foreseeable differences the quality of money to different country. So one country is more inflationary the other is that this stationary What happens is that promotes? Exports on those countries that have a worse money because the residents of those countries. Well, they want to reduce Autumn minimize their Holdings of their own inflationary money as much as possible, right so they want to get hold of a better money. This is what you see in all countries that are so dollar rise rise the phenomena of polarization. All of these countries have export surpluses and the strings from the fact that they need to pay for the dollars that they really want to own. They don't want to all their own. Local pocket money they want to own as our bodies such as the last so long since nobody's giving the colors they need to buy them. So they export so they have a structural export Surplus and therefore countries with the better money than structural import circles. All right. So the the industry is those countries are suffering under foreign competition precisely because foreigners want to get some of the local Honey, that's the reason why the US for example as structural import deficit because many more even though the dollar might be quite lousy as a money, especially as compared to Gold. It's still better than most of the other monies that are around in the world. So people want to buy buy dollars and there are therefore they need to export services to get those those dollars from the US and therefore soup President Trump's policies that try to reverse this trend just with Exponent important controls with tariffs and so on will not succeed. Simply for this reason you see so the difficulty of such a country is not that the police use of work would not workers not before the country. It's that it creates pressure on the local producers. And so you get political resistance from that definitely that's that's brilliant.	1.0
And once again you guys are so amazing listening to me.	1.0
Yeah, we're back to let's play it even feel when it comes to all 124 Queen like a Pokemon. So yeah, it's know. I don't know. I didn't think that I don't understand why she didn't win. It was funny. I just don't think it matched the song. I think if it was a different song that it went with it would have won. I just it didn't make sense as soon as soon as she came out. I get that she was trying to do something different and show a different side of Trinity, which is fine. Fine, and I you know, and I encourage it but it should have been done with it. Just it didn't make sense for the song. It really truly didn't I mean if you can explain it to me and justify it I will take everything that I'm saying right now back, but you can't because it didn't fit the song. She didn't even like this in her 20s, at least she was in just in a dance costume and she just danced and she roll at least she rolled on the floor when they said you spin me right round like it made slack. I'm not saying it was phenomenal, but it just didn't it didn't work for me.	-1.0

That's the first time I've ever really I can still wear my watch but I felt was unnecessary. Yeah, like I was I didn't check my watch at all like that all around it as a race and then I got good times out of it and still felt like looking back. I still feel like I got more to give and yeah, just enjoy the race. Yeah. Yeah, so take whatever.	1.0
Oh, yeah. Nice. That's cheesy like FM phones up like worried to be like always worried about what what's going to happen with this Maps because I don't think valve communicate that well. With the mappers and people who get their Maps included in the game or anyone for that matter. So I think it's a probably a sigh of relief for him who I'm sure it does a lot of this stuff by himself without even talking about like for example with a simple graffiti that's on cash under Heaven on be site. He did that himself. It's not it's not actually a major a major moment graffiti by Valve. It's a graffiti. He added by himself picking up from from the major.	1.0

No, he never gave me a straight forward answer was just like, you know things happen or you know that and I even when I would question him about his own family like, you know, your siblings and this and how did because his family was from, Norfolk, Virginia? My will how did you end up in New York and how even when I'm you know, if I talk to my mom about like she can only go to a certain point because you know, she didn't know his family or she knew he had the one cousin over here. But you know, there's just so many just gray areas of, you know, we don't have the information and you know in some of our conversations. I've really tried to open that door like share your story. Like I know you have a story to like, you know, and he like I said, he would just close off he was just	-1.0

Need to go to a diner on one of those guys and there's a reason for it. It's because I went to Africa to shoot a documentary and I was working with a really brilliant guy called dynein Manda and he found he's an Australian Navy clearance diver. Also who founded the International anti-poaching Foundation and he started the first all-female run from the anti-poaching Rangers to the managers to the staff to the H all female run from Broken backgrounds abandoned by their tribes and Villages domestic abuse women and he's down in them together to fight poaching in Africa and I was there filming with him and he didn't eat me and that just blew my mind. I'm like why the hell would you like one big and I'm like what the hell is happening? I don't think me and I said why you know, I grew up. I love meat. I eat ate all the kangaroos in the world and he said we'll look I was out here trying to protect the animals and then I go home and I'd eat the animals and I felt like a hypocrite and that kind of run of bell with me and I thought well shit, I'm doing that with the oceans and I'm eating animals and I hate hypocrites, you know in the military were trained to lead by example to do as I do not as I say and so I always drive to be that sort of person so I can't justifiably go out into the world and say hey you need to protect sharks and look after our oceans and look after our environment if I'm going home and I'm contributing to the destruction and so very very slowly and I'm talking very slowly. I started canceling out different things and expanding my repertoire of vegetables and Grains and all that sort of stuff and I've been plant-based for nearly four years now and I love it. I'll never go back why I thought feel healthy strong. I didn't lose any muscles, you know, I didn't grow boobs for meeting so food, and I haven't had a single injury training in four years. So I'm Happy I'm strong. But at least I've got vegan barbecue. I'm screwed.	1.0
Okay, next you're going to want to spray your mirrors with a glass or multi-surface cleaner and that same step. I also spray the faucets and then I wipe those down could be with a microfiber cloth.

Yeah. So yeah, he's like guns or religion to me. And he's like all these specific things that he couldn't do. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I wasn't sure how cool he was. I felt like they're trying to do like kind of like a drive Vibe Ryan Gosling for Drive type 5, which I liked but then that's the vibe that if anything goes wrong, he's definitely capable of fixing it, even though he gets really fucked up. Yeah, but I right he's been he's been like Daddy by a couple of characters who are either smarter than him or whatever. Hmm.

This week daylight savings has been kicking our butts. So we have had a lot of just morning meltdowns this week of really like we had I don't know if Elise was ever like this but we have had he doesn't like to wear socks because I don't like to wear socks. Yeah, it's a sensory thing, but I also don't like to wear socks and I don't I don't I don't promote socks in the summer and she always wears like natives usually don't wear socks because they're perforated and my mom gets so mad at me because she thinks that their room Her heels anyway off topic there. Um, but it's the other day. She came out with a summer dress on and it was strawberries all over it. She's like I'm wearing this to school and I'm like, well, how do you want? It's like 20 degrees outside. Yeah, we got to wear tights we get tights on her and then it was just like the World War 3 with the seam in the thing in the boot and the we couldn't make it work. So finally like she's like in the living room no clothes on. She's like, I'm not going to school today. This is Aeolus and I'm like, well, you have to go to school one. So then we're trying to be logical. I'm like, well you like to go down the flagpole at school. So if you don't wear tights you have to your legs gonna get really cold on the flagpole. Yeah, and you can get hurt like you could get frostbite or something. So what finally be like agreed to pants and a shirt but it's like whoo buddy, like the sock thing is a challenge for us right now. So today I Center in glit like some glittery looking Ugg boots. What does it we don't have to wear socks because they're furry on the inside. So compromised. Yes, that's good. Gravy, how about you?	-1.0
Yeah. So well produced. We're so off schedule Waters. Can you tell the world and all the fans? Why are we so late? Why don't we were supposed to do this? Weekly? Okay. I'm putting you on blast before the podcast.	1.0

Hello. We are here. In the AfterBuzz TV Club, that's me being a record. I am your host one, two, three Jackie B. I'm here with smart a Freeman turn that I've ever the corridor. Sorry. Hi guys, it's Mark. I'm here trying to spin right around in my chair and your lies in the house everybody you thirsty as well.	-1.0
Yeah, there's this Christian who I actually really like I mean, I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I really like him and his name is Sean McDowell and he gave like this really cool talk where he pretended to be an atheist at a Christian college and he put on his atheist glasses me like talk to them as if he was an atheist giving all of like, you know, the atheist answer. is I guess and for the most part I thought he did a pretty good job, but then he kind of like took his glasses off and was like, like how do you guys think you did and it was just it was like how did you feel when you were being like questioned by me and like you weren't really winning the argument so to say like and they were like like I was mean to you like I was aggressive and I was defensive and you know, I felt attacked and I just wanted to prove you wrong so bad. Like I wasn't being loving through that and he his point was basically like Christians shouldn't be scared of Doubt because they should be a Christian because they believe that it is true. And if it after all of the research that you do if you come to the conclusion that you don't think it's true. Then you shouldn't be a Christian and he said that's okay you like you have to not be afraid of just pouring all the facts. Out there and and being true to yourself in that and of course he wants everyone to be saved but like no, that's really beautiful.	1.0
It's like your TV opened up and she stepped into the living room the craziest thing this far to be honest.	1.0

We always kind of wrap up here with the same question. If you had a megaphone and you could speak to the whole construction industry and tell them the best thing, you know, and you had 60 seconds to do it. What would you say the best thing that I know project selectivity?	1.0
Like okay Shirley's right again. This is why she's always right.	1.0
It reminds me of a phrase. I heard during the first.com boom. So I ran 99 or 2000 which is the Pioneers get the arrows and the settlers get the land. So in this in this context Britain's actually being a bit of a Pioneer.	1.0
it was pretty great. Like I've never really felt that way before it was like probably one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. Yeah. It was really cool because like the volleyball team Adam wanted 15 years and it's like a big milestone just to win again and like I haven't done like a basketball like we haven't won the basketball championship or anything. So it was just really cool.	1.0
What was such a great film? Yeah.	1.0
All right, Taylor has the questions on her phone because I sent them to her.	0.0
You know, you're in great shape or I want to be like you right? I don't I truly don't believe that I would be in the shape. I am now if it wasn't for my environment, right like you are what your environment is if I hang out with a whole bunch of depressed people most likely I'm going to be depressed if I hang around with people that are usually up like really positive most likely I'll be positive if I'm hanging around people that all Count Their macros and go to the gym six times a week most likely I'll be fit right etcetera. So I am kind of humbled. I'm occupation, but the same time if I worked at nine to five or ten to six whatever it's either I got to wake up really early in the morning and be tired and work out or go to the gym after work where I'm tired and work out. So I understand like how hard it must be for people to have consistency. Like you have to make it a daily plan where you're going to go designate this time and just execute and stick with it. Right and accountabilities huge. You know, that's why I said It's important to have somebody that could keep you in check. Whether is your best friend your brother or your spouse or a trainer a coach whatever but honestly with those people I completely understand. I think the goal is really just to find a balance in your life. Like it's not everybody's goal to be in the next bikini competitions not everybody's goal to be the next powerlifter. It's not everybody's goal to run a mile in, you know, five minutes six minutes. I think just follow what makes you happy with his Jiu-Jitsu that you love if it's basketball. All that you love if it's yoga that you love just continue to do that and you know be mindful of your nutrition. I think for me what's really worked is intermittent fasting is give me it gives me a block where I could eat at a particular time also count my calories and I think that gives me flexibility with feeding Cravings think counting calories is a huge skill that a lot of people don't consistently do and I'm a big advocate of that because that really changed my life ever since we watched The Hodgetwins that's how I learned counting calories. Calories in versus calories out. These guys are eating chicken the chicken nuggets. They're eating pizza. They're having Taco Bell and they're still looking good and I was like, I was confused. What do we eat for dinner? Like I was under the conventional thought that you have to eat brown rice chicken and broccoli meal prep your food in order for you to be fit. But you don't yeah, you don't like you. All you have to do is track your calories do a little bit of cardio hit a little bit of resistance just baby steps like when my favorite quotes is by Bruce Lee and he says I do not fear the man. The kick is 10,000 times. I fear the man the kicks once a day for ten thousand days. So at the end of the day, it's not about short-term intensity. It's about consistency. Right just it's it's the accumulation of the little things that matter right? It's habits is where we're creatures of habit. So I think that's about anything in life. If you want to be successful in anything. It's really just about consistency. That's it.	1.0
If you'd like to call me on night flirt. The number there is one 888-635-5476 or 78 my extension. Yeah, that's super long. Number one zero one eight eight zero nine three. That's all my blog to I hope to hear from you, bye-bye.	0.0

So my first nude was on a Snapchat and it was literally just like a cleavage shot like a little bit boring now like very like it was like PG like the not even PG-13 but that had to have been like maybe like four years ago when I first started like losing weight and feeling like more confident in my body and in my cell Elf so that was like my first time being like oh, all right, like show yourself. You're feeling good. You're looking good. How do you want to like let this out and I feel like I also try to bring that out and other people. Oh for real. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I mean you took my first like round of like multiple news for me because like I didn't know how to hit angles or like hold my arm far enough away.	1.0
I don't I did writing but it's it was just not I'm sorry the I thought the role play between Dolly and mamaw was kind of funny so Miley. Only dressed up Lily was Maman Miley was dilated that really so I see how they like acted. Well what I liked about it was Jackson. I thought he was funny. It was funny when he played Elvis.	1.0
There's a lot going to people's birthday parties and I just was like, I can't like if I heard your voice from behind a door, I would know it was you. Yeah regardless of where I was. Yeah, so I just don't I don't I don't understand I get that. It's a kid show. And like at the time I didn't think much of it but it's just come on. Yeah, I mean I understand for her classmates as a little different but again, like you said something supposed to be that way. Yeah. Oh, I know this is stupid, but I noticed when Donzi left and they were still like out in the parking lot area. They have Fountain that's just full of flowers. No water so funny.	-1.0
So that's all I have to say about bathrooms today.	0.0
But it's yeah sloppy by both teams only really two teams in good form, obviously and Sheffield United the way they're set up to be fair to and was good.

Here we go, but we grew into its second after we got we got better and better about and in the end we probably could have we could have won it but you think back to the mat chances though that Sheffield United out of what we look quite shake it the back.	-1.0
We mentioned that the varying degrees of wealth within a society if we look at let's say a selection of different countries. How sustainable do you think the the euro currency system is given that you've got clearly delineations of wealth between the core and the periphery and that's manifest in the in youth unemployment.	-1.0
I agree and then at the end of the episode after they like have like literally brawl. They're literally having a broad.	-1.0
Yeah, and that will definitely during the time when the with 106 & Park Until rail was going on. So, I mean, that's why a lot of people knew about her including myself, but it was just so many artists that came out then so it definitely was easy like you Like you said to just just get missed throughout their Bunch, but the real recognize her that's what I'll say the real the real recognize we never forgot about you Emory. So I thought right so shot to you. Why don't we fall in love came out in 2002 and what you got for this week's vlog?	1.0
Is that what I'm going to do and why will be just a warehouse worker and you know, well, I just go to the work working two shifts and go home clean my garden, right? So I was slowly having that thought in me as we move on. Where did it come from? It comes from our community our church Community who giving us Visions like that's really important that you have that community that will guide you through it.	1.0

So let's let's kick off we know each other from I think through a mutual friend initially gentleman by the name of Tony deed and in Zurich, we have probably Define behind introducing his personally and it would be fair to say that the Tony is an advocate of the so-called Austrian School. I although I didn't know the Austrian School when I set out in my career. I think I'm a little bit more familiar with it. Now, how would You so sum up the so-called Austrian School of Economics.	1.0

So like blindly following it without opening their mind to any sort of like, I don't know the only very specific scriptures, by the way, because yeah, they much like me or the pastor's I've had would quote like something really beautiful and then you read two lines down and it's like by the way, like slavery is should be honored and you're like wait what people that's what's so funny because I recently did a video about gay marriage as well and I was responsible.	-1.0

So one of the things that that I brought it at the point that I brought up before about how there was rioting in this new episode. The didn't really age well and like wasn't appropriate for children is that they continually use the word trans?	-1.0
Yeah, it was crazy. Well like my whole experience with Christianity stemmed from my friend group. Like I wasn't raised a Christian I was raised and like just a very loving secular home and religion wasn't talked about and so, you know actually like First experience with Christianity happened when I was 12 years old. I was in my seventh grade science class and we were learning about Evolution exempt these two girls got so mad and they were like, what about Adam and Eve? What about the Garden of Eden? Like how can you be teaching this stuff in a public school? Like they were so mad and I was like, who are you talking about? Like who's Adam? Who is Eve? Like I didn't I was so ignorant. Ignorant and so I think at that point I kind of like became their salvation project and I was starting from like a blank slate like I didn't know anything about religion really and so I kind of just accepted that what they were saying was true and my parents never wanted to tell me like what to believe or what not to believe but that kind of lead to like an unhealthy. Like one-sided argument that was like filling my brain coming from my friends and I didn't like I don't know. I didn't necessarily critically think too much about it.	-1.0
Yeah. So so you go or he dropped it joint so somebody I'm gonna listen to the rest of this and then we'll talk about that next episode. But in that man, that's it has been in line town. Episode 18.

Other than that man flocking on any final words before we close this out.	1.0
So don't think it'll take a like I'm bragging. I'm just trying to say how it works for us financially and up it to be efficient. I bought a bull at the NFR sell two years ago, but we call him 100x helmets Boot Hill. Well, I guess 3500 for him at the NFR sell two years ago taking him to the National Finals twice and the other day at Sacramento PBR. They are Vieira was 89 on them want to short go on him, you know, and I know that that doesn't always work out like that. I'm not being trying to be naive either that that it always works out like that but like him or the bull jive turkey that they the other Brazilian boy rows are in the short goat Sacramento. I bought Josh Last year at the enough ourselves. I give 6,000 for him. He come from Toby Floyd and and that and he was like $89 88-89 on him a guy can put by a really damn good bull anymore.	1.0
Did he ever tell you that or share that with you know, honestly, like I just remember on the show because there's just so many people in the show and I can't blame him like he sees so many act today and like, oh the qualifiers are there laws overwhelming. Yeah. It's so overwhelming, so I'm not Expecting him to like remember every performance we do or everyone does but I do remember on the show. He did say that what he called me called me a good zeiger a tiger mix with a gazelle.	0.0
Musicians and so on and the lifestyle so answers kind of suspect but what I understood as long as long as you got the sex and the drugs who needs the Rock and wrong definitely impressed me so much was it came out that he was such a good person.

Yeah, well as much alluded to earlier on with giving the goals away too easily. We're not killing games off and that's why we against against Braga and the next game should have been out of sight really but I was actually here when that game was going on and then drove back listen to on the radio and I just said it just makes the come back for the form of even more amazing when they inevitably come back in two days. You didn't know that there was one that was going to give it away at some point we Play well for 90. It was very similar to The Villa guy absolutely battered of their staff from one of our best performances with Villa and then they get a man set off as well. So I'm thinking what is going to absolutely annihilate him second half but they seem to up their game with yeah - we just I don't know what happened. But that goal from a teeny. Oh, you think it was across that? Yeah, I think mentees you think I think he meant. Well you did it again today.

But like if I guess if you know if your life was going to be good that you probably want to do it have a Teenage life. But if you know, it's not going to be good.

So sometimes you need to hang the other stuff up, especially if you have more space in your closet, then you do in your drawers. So that's just an idea for your bedroom.

I felt like they were taking up.	-1.0

It just feels like we're hanging out as friends, you know, so it's been really fun and also on the days off that we don't have anything. We like to just come into the studio and just keep practicing our Basics and perfecting them. So when they do need us, we always look like the best that we can possibly start all the time. So no matter what we always have an agreement that we show up to the studio and we practice as much as we can together so that lets say for the opening number if they need us they call us and we're ready to go at any	1.0

Lorenz is well and that it didn't supposed to be that no, no, okay. Just beat me out for the role. I went up for the role. They went up for the role and I was like what happened at that joint. It was I already filming it with who learn and I love the rain. So I was like I will you know, he got the better of me that but that's the one when I saw the movie. I was like Tim. She's like yo, he did his thing he did his thing in the movies.	-1.0
The Lord was telling me you are still blessed with these three kids like it is it's an ornament. It's a thing you have your children. You have your husband like it.	1.0
Yeah, and the field wasn't huge. I have to say a lot of people also dnf'd and there was the option to At a certain point you could decide if you wanted to continue doing a hundred and nine or instead do the 69k option and a few people chose that option. I was determined to finish. I want to buy cowboy hat, which is what you've got if you finish the hundred and nine case, but yeah, I don't know. I just um, I just pulled it along with you just want to always do just just put a lot to take a checkpoint to checkpoint Jenga homework. I do feel nauseous for myself. The day I felt quite it all I didn't eat a whole lot that. I really kept my fluids and electrolytes. And so yeah, that was more electrolytes taking it slow heat up. Yeah, excellent. And if you give to give the to give the listener and not some idea it was 10 degrees above 10 degrees Celsius above normal. So about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and probably a little bit less maybe 70 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit above the normal temperature. Tommy year so it was really a guy that gets fixed. It's a very exposed area there.	1.0
And go down to just a t-shirt with short sleeves and I don't care if it's the dead of winter I get hot.	-1.0
Definitely. Alright. Well look we kind of I know how much time and energy goes into starting and most and and money goes into starting and then running a staging company trying to build it, but that's not the only thing you have going on. You're also the owner or co-owner of a brick-and-mortar retail shop called the Hub home Trader I think is the name there. So tell me a little bit about that business and kind of how and why that was started.	1.0
Well just yesterday. I was telling my mom like, oh my gosh. I feel so much better my anxiety and then this morning I texted her and I was like, please erase everything. I just said yesterday because I'm feeling very anxious again. And I think for me to just like getting outside of your head talking to somebody else like just because anxiety story self-focused and just if you can like get outside of Yourself a little bit.	-1.0
Yeah anyway. Hey, everybody was good. For example football. Send us there. You know what it was great. When I think it was ridiculous that the weather, you know, it's like it go to Portugal be no set time here. It's November. All right now all day. Yeah, it'll be mild and it was it just I don't think we stepped outside and it was dry at any given point. So but apart from that lovely evening.	1.0
That's a prediction. It sounds like Okay, so, you know when we did a Szechuan sauce, I was so sad that I didn't not get any like I went there and I was waiting for the time because they said oh yeah 2 p.m. Is when we'll be putting it people got out of me for that. Like he got a 6:00 a.m. They were giving it out when they weren't supposed to I was a little pissed I kind of wanted to taste it isn't it? Like duck sauce for something isn't like really not or sweet and sour sauce. Yeah.	-1.0
I'm recovering from black all yet.	1.0
So that's something that I'm going to be getting when I can afford it.	0.0
So let's pause there Jody Craddock loads of people have said this he died 16 times in this decade.	-1.0
Yeah, they had it. They had a body double for some of the harder hits.	1.0
He's fucking having the time of his life. Just asking to play video games or whatever and you're like you fucking realize we just put me through.	1.0
We're going to take about 40 to 45 minutes to cover this thing. First of all food. What's food doing bedroom?	0.0
Yeah.	1.0
You know, I do believe that there is Merit to some of these like Health Trends or these different things that are being promoted now sure but 100% you should always experiment and try something on for yourself and then decide for yourself if it works for you. Don't take anything. Even sometimes what your doctor is telling you like. Nobody knows more about your body and what something feels like in your own experience than you do. With intuitive eating it's like you have to develop that strong internal Compass so that you know when something sits right because you know, I use this example all the time but like something like broccoli for example is generally considered a healthy food, right? So it's like maybe you think I need to be eating more broccoli or like even if I don't like the taste of broccoli, it's healthy. I should be eating it. Some people may eat broccoli and get horrible gas or a terrible stomach ache and like not be able to function because Are so bloated for the rest of the day for that person maybe broccoli is actually not a healthy choice and maybe they can find another vegetable that works for them. So if their Doctor is recommending them to eat more broccoli, it's just not going to be the thing for them.	-1.0
I know I'm loving it. I'm so glad you all enjoyed it and it's super interesting for me to hear about the connections with behavior because I do think there's like a primal element to intuitive eating that is hard to understand cognitively. But if you if you attach these behavioral principles that makes a lot more sense.	1.0
Isn't that funny you think like oh Dancing with the Stars or world of dances The Source, but no, it's Lauren Adams directed this video that went viral, you know, I believable. So Cara thanked you for that question because yeah, obviously it came right back around.	1.0
This is the last four or five years where we will invite our Jewish friends over and they'll their kids get to help because they're excited to decorate the truck in love it. And by the way, I don't know if I didn't agree with me, but I think decorating trees kind of a pain in the ass. I agree 1 million percent which is why I was getting people that are more excited and much more work. So it is great while I stand my end.	-1.0
Hey guys, Tyler here. Thank you so much for joining us today. I would point you to a couple things before you go as always look at the show notes. For any links to our guests, and you'll be able to find links to every single one of our social accounts.

Oh my God, you gotta wait at the practice. That's yeah. That's tough.	-1.0
Yeah, and you know at the end of the day Latos, the the prescription meds are safe. But if you do combine some of them you are more prone to a possible overdose. You got to be very aware of the timing when you take them.	-1.0
But I mean, let's talk about the level of padding things like multiple people associated with Move I've gotten Petty with fans to a level. I don't think I've really used to I mean, I think the only thing that comes close is like Steven Universe, but like I heard that been in what kind of aren't it was a Steven Universe or Voltron Voltron Voltron where you know, there was a huge class between the Show creator people of people involved with the show and fandom and they actually kind of went back and forth with each other, but that was later. So like before Teen Wolf, I don't really remember that happening. Often enough for people to find out about it.	-1.0
Well, I mean, I've only not just one one factor that comes here to play. There are several reasons for one for example, is that many people academics in particular just like to play. Yeah. I think it's a very powerful motivation many Meg This like to play with models with numbers.	1.0
I like the color I think in our markets where I'm like that's good.	1.0
We love George what these are it was just two goals against Monday night. Yeah, I still play he was just technically he's he's a fan favorite with you going to technical ability. He was he was pants yet. Even he was he was he was he was a strength Merchant.	1.0
Yeah, so so just because you don't have the nicest camera just because you're shooting with an iPhone just because you don't have A lot of lights just because you don't even have another person to make movies with leaving yourself that kind of follows what you're saying don't have an ego and I think you'll be just fine in this production world.	1.0
Um, I remember it was back during the first season when it was episode 9 the scene where Styles pushes Derek are Derek bushes. Stiles up against the door, and I thought that they were going to kiss but they didn't so then I kind of just dropped the whole thing didn't really think anything of it and then in like 2012. I got Tumblr and I saw like a piece of fan art for Styles and Derek and I was like, oh there are other people who thought the same thing that I thought so then I checked the stair tag, and this was back when like there was like three pieces of like fan art and like a few little pose. And then I found out about shipping and fandom and like before that. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what shipping was and like steric was like my first Fick and then I just kind of just stayed in the fandom as if that's the show went on in the guns like season 2 when Jeff was like talking about steric more on Twitter back when he had a Twitter. He wasn't scared to talk to us.	0.0
Well, you know what it is worth it. It's worth it. It's an awesome question. What is it like being a first-time mom and having your first baby yikes.	1.0
Yeah, fake tree decide what you say not a light one. You to say a fake tree your you see, you know, like you say.	-1.0
So we have a new tradition.	1.0
Well, I think what we've noticed and talking when owners and studying. This is just a lack of vision at the onset of the project if owners and contractors alike are coming into a particular project opportunity and they're aligned on what possible from an off-site standpoint that really bodes well for maximizing the prefabrication or off-site potential on the project. It's I think it's what works hard as if there's a basic project that gets design and then a contractor or a contractor in a designer than says all right, what part of this can we can we manufacture off-site since having that alignment going in from the beginning with owner the engineer and a contractor all aligned saying this is this is really how we want to achieve this any kind of modular design any kind of prefabrication off-site construction really originates in the planning period of the construction process, right?	1.0
I honestly think that this is a this type of situation that we're going through right now is ideal. Feel for a trade down Drew lock is sitting there with some team licking their chops trying to get ahead of the of the Washington Redskins. I honestly think that they could they could get a pretty good haul if they traded out of this position you trade down a few spots, maybe four or five and you're still getting Jonah Williams Noah fan TJ Hawkinson greedy Williams, even who I would be completely okay with Green Bay spending a first-round pick, even though they spent so much draft capital on the position. You know, I you can never have too many corners, especially In and defense, excuse me, like like Mike patents. However, it's obviously a luxury to spend on a corner. I think at this point, I'm not ready to spend a top-15 pick on Devon Bush. That's my honest feeling about that. I think I think Brian Burns would be the selection for me here if if we had to take a selection at 12.	1.0
Although you will undoubtedly be ready to jump right in there are a few more tasks you need.	-1.0
I love what you said because so to answer your question from earlier like a lot of people think okay. If I if I ditch the diet mentality, which I'll name as the first principle of intuitive eating. eating is stepping away actually from those diets from the strict rules about what's quote-unquote good or bad for you and instead giving yourself permission to include all different types of foods in your life in a way that promotes balance and you know, just Variety in general so To answer the question. Can I eat whatever I want? It's like yeah, you can you can eat whatever you want. But if you truly are in tune with yourself and listening to your body, as you said Casey, I would I would imagine and I've experienced and I know a lot of people I work with have experience that you do want to eat more foods that make you feel good because when you are connected to how you feel after certain foods, you're less likely to just eat, you know foods that drain that energy or that make you feel Early tired sure, you're going to eat them sometimes but I think people have this idea that like if I didn't have this super intense discipline around what I ate, I would just like, you know stock up on french fries and Twizzlers all day and I think we need to give ourselves more credit than that.	1.0
So this is this is a tricky question. But if you had the power to do whatever you want to Change the economic landscape in terms of how its taught how governments make decisions what would you do?	-1.0
I've been to I never get done you've been there. For six hours, but time you get there a little bit early and you watch and they have the Indian relay. They have the Indian relay races and I mean it in a policy say the way when I say your be there for six hours. I mean, it's six hours of fun. But time you go to The Letter Buck room and you go to the when you go to the rodeo starts and they have like I said the Indian relay races The Wild Cow Milking and they Buck, you know, 20 whore 20 bare backs 20 Bronx a bunch of bulls have did they have you know, there's just a whole bunch of Stuff and and and it's awesome. It's just so I guess what a person has to really be cognitive of is that it's not always about this. Like it's there rodeos aren't just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter everybody and every Rodeo has a different, you know different way of marketing their deal and that's what I think is pretty really pretty cool about the West Coast rodeos in particular. Is that whether you're at Salinas with the bullfights and what's going on and the California rodale and then you go to the Pendleton with the with the Native American You know history involved in the Tepee Village and all that all all even over to Joseph Organ, you know where that you know Chief Joseph days. I really felt celebrate the best Perce tribe and all that's going on. It's just a lot a lot of different things that play into how they Market their rodeos and how they do their thing is and each each one's different a little bit but really kind of there's a lot a lot to to see in a lot to check out. It's really cool. I think. So, like I said, it's not there not just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter there. It's there's just each one's a little bit different and I like it.	1.0
Well because this is like Latrice is redemption was should be the name of the episode. Yeah, that's exactly what it was. Well that being said are we talking about the hive now?	1.0
I got it already at the end of the year. So I already giving a class we already so when you when you opened then yeah.	1.0
Alright, so we are on the draft network. Of course, you can listen to yesterday's podcast with Joel Marino from the draft Network and we're going to use their predictive board go through four rounds and will be manually picking each Packer pick at 12:30 and the to for second and third as well. So as things go along I am solely scrolling through right now. And the big thing right now is Kyla Marie didn't go number one. and so with our pick We do have Brian Burns out there. Both Iowa tight ends out there DK Metcalf is the currently the highest rated player out there for this one as long with along with Devin Bush.	1.0
I know your daughter. At the I know so it's a little late and she just wants to maximize the amount of weekends we have with it, especially since we go to Connecticut for like the week of Christmas.

So many I can't even keep up.	1.0
They were the fighting was obnoxious and it they're supposed to be the adults which is why I brought up the whole before they make the adults look stupid a real adult, especially someone who claims to care about their granddaughter and their goddaughter that much would never ruin an awards night evening so they could fight about stupid shit.	-1.0
Right right kind of touch on my side of that later. But yeah that's important right it is and so, you know,	1.0

Anyway, the Danbury podcast. You may know me from social media. You may not that's okay. I don't know how you possibly found this podcast. If you don't I'm on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter not on Tick Tock yet thinking about it as I've said before thinking about it. Okay.	0.0
All my time hop, I forever see tweets from about 2010 saying why isnt Adam Hamill playing I was desperate for him to play.	-1.0
Well, that's I'm really glad that you don't have a major problem injury at think it's a it's sort of Testament. I think to just you running by feel and not sometimes you could probably better at listening to the body than a lot of other athletes myself included some time. I mean, I've had a few in I don't get into what I'm bit like you that I have had a couple of injuries this year, which is big It's train but you know, so yeah fantastic. So another thing that's going to bring up with you is sorry I jumped you again.	1.0
Yeah, just a Terry underlying mantle on Twitter.	0.0

So just recently here in Adelaide. We had the six day race. So the MI6 day. Yeah, the only one in the country and I spent a fair bit of time down there since very close to Mike to where I live and phenomenal like these guys so they run at one point four kilometer Loop. Around this path, which goes past the nice little like and they do it for six days. And it was just and it got quite warm we had the first couple days was windy and cold and then I got quite hot and we had I think the winning distance in the end was a local guy named Darren Darren Lenny who did 835 kilometers in six days and handling. Yeah was my blind. Yeah. But I just and I know there was some amazing performances right across the board like Annabelle Hepworth you I think he's from Queensland. She came she was second out right? And she said Chris Ryan Chris was there she was the second lady. She bought she did oversee.	1.0
Thanks very much indeed. Line up by now that was fascinating absolutely loved it. So interesting really really interesting just before we came on air you were mentioning the House of Commons. Yeah, the I think we must be watching this. I forget the Channel's name because it was either the BBC News Channel or BBC Parliament and possibly both because we ended up switching off at about 10 o'clock in the evening and we started watching roughly lunchtime and I I tuned in to catch boris's statement returning from New York after the Supreme Court ruling and actually it was almost one of those entertaining afternoons of my things in my life. So for anyone asked to see me, you must watch if it's not the full show that at least the highlights of Jeffrey cocks the Attorney General because it was absolutely a PST A Pas du tout pas de resistance. Unbelievably full-blown that the whole works in the guys going to this is amazing roaring baritone anyway, but he just he just blew blew the opposition away. I think there were there were heavy expectations coming into yesterday because we're recording this on Thursday the 26th 26th of September. So it's a few days just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the Pierogi of Parliament and there's an expectation coming. Into the commons that know that they were going to Duff up the attorney general and follow up by duffing up Boris and my god did those expectations get reversed very very quickly. So first the Jeffrey Cox in this is fantastic and hilarious and then you have you know, the man himself. So Boris came in and basically just gave no quarter and there's a very appreciate what Dido just said about social media. He's absolutely right, but if you do have the To engage with say Twitter. There is a very special pleasure that can come with engaging with Twitter while simultaneously watching a big event and the Parliamentary session was a big event. So it's almost that's that's what it's designed. Almost all yeah always had become as a mixture of Theater Grand guignol black comedy. I don't know how to describe it. I'll be I'll be looking at grand grand. What does that thing? I couldn't tell you I decided to extend impressive but the Macabre so I've always interpreted, but I don't You know the full definition Barack possibly. I'm just starting at mindless French words now either. What's I don't know what's happening and being taken over by Spirit of Madness. But Boris launches at there was no Contrition. No apology was General Gregory an to the power of infinity and during during the proceedings. Basically, he's worked out perfectly how to be the world's most successful troll on the back of perhaps the success of gone. From so he started using the phrase surrender Bill about the Hilary Benn act which is basically means to be can't can't leave without a deal and every time he used the term surrender Bill the opposition benches would just get would just get more and more Angry. So course you would then continue to use the phrase surrender bills that why you change your Twitter hand. So I've changed my Twitter handle to surrender a bill cousin of surrender bill, but last night I was just having the funniest. Time of it and then I thought okay. Let's really go for it. And I said could everybody please stop using the word surrender Bill hashtag surrender Bill and then I think followed up with the first rule of surrender bill is due not mentions do not talk about surrender Bill. The second rule of surrender will is do not talk about surrender Bill and those have been my most popular tweets ever. So everyone has been filed in and it was extraordinarily funny how that must is so much fun. But on honest on a slightly more sobering note D. The one thing that Also kind of a last night was I think was Barry Sherman and some woman who is named. I don't even want to remember from the Labour party the amount of hostility rage blind rage real hateful rage that came back up Boris is it was a sight to believe and for what? It's worth. I'm and I'm clearly on one side of debate among arm the pro breaks it side but it struck me that I think labor and the lib Dems have called the public mood a hundred percent wrong on this so when they're saying own, Where the language is in temperate and in moderate and all the rest of it? I think they're no because what Boris was doing yesterday was he was giving a like a sort of a Channel of venting for those of us those Seventeen point four million people who basically felt completely cheesed off the last three and a bit years and he's actually no lightning rod for the for the opposition but an opportunity for those those sitting there not a trivial number of people who frankly have felt cheated and betrayed and he's now he's now just Taken the taken the fight to Parliament in those small way. I know anything can happen. But what do you what do you think the next steps are II couldn't even begin to say because I mean, I'm no expert in Parliament procedure and there's been but apparently neither. Does anybody else this writing the laws now as they go on I saw a headline saying that Boris had lied to the queen or something is that these terms are very nuanced. So I'm again stress. I'm no expert but my take on it is that at Boris had perfectly Sound Advice perfectly credible advice from his legal people including the Attorney General to do what he did your ocean to the mechanics as that basically said dismissing Parliament to then reinstating it the later date and that was all deemed to be sufficiently legal for him to go ahead and meet the queen and then the Supreme Court Bear in mind that also a number of very high-profile local British Justice. People also approved it and then the Supreme Court 11 to nothing decided that it was it was technically unlawful. But I think is Boris himself said what's really happened is that the legal system has been brought in it to a pine on these it has no matter talking about it has nothing to do with politics. This is the last thing you really want to happen in terms of the UK the British constitution. It is not for the courts to decide what parliamentary procedure ought to be. Like it's none of their business and you know, because we've got hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent to draw upon and people are now that that is exactly what gido is talking about in relation to the elites. Now when the elites had cornered they will do absolutely anything to you know to ensure that they win. Well, I think in this case this is this is a classic example of a Battle Royal where neither side is backing down, but the difference is know that there was a simple majority the leave And that simple majority a total of 17 and a half million people have been ignored for us three years. So no surprise that they're angry that I'm angry. And so there's a phrase that John Lanchester used it in one of his pieces a while back guy who writes for London of your books that somebody going to quote ridiculous Basil's 40-ish lengths unquote to achieve something and that's what the remain cap of done. So they're driving a coach and horses through historical precedent through law. You're through normal parliamentary life through everything just to overturn a perfectly legitimate vote. It's quite sickening. Really. Are you have some I know some people who are remain has and I get I detect that they are starting to get weary with it as well. You know Whitney nothing. Yeah, if we're not careful something get killed. Well, I say that in all sincerity. I don't mean it to have her that wanted to happen. But if trust me when you see the footage of certain labor and peas just that does blind with Fury just lashing out at Boris is deeply unsettling. Well, we can still get there. Can we is that particular YouTube and I've had some this morning on some more happy topics. I just want to say a couple of shout. Shouts first of all to Dixie Deville on YouTube. Thank you for your lovely comments. We really appreciate them and Andrew Smith on Twitter and Hamish capital. Thank you for your comments to and always as always Stewart button and David Harrison.

Yeah. I mean you said it before this impact. Every single thing they do for the rest of this winter and knocking it out now would be an advantageous because then you can start to set up what your team looks like without him. But if you hold on to him now and you start to make moves that is in anticipation of what a roster looks like with Francisco Lindor and then the trade comes you probably still make it but it's going to be a lot more difficult trying to make that audible on the Fly and then it becomes even more interesting as these trade talks unfold as you're sitting there and as a front office you think you're Maybe You're starting to make some progress and then the the other side of the table says yeah, we're sorta into it. But you know what we might need a guy like Mike Clevenger coming back.	1.0
It's crazy. You say that I pray break. Some cows has this winter and my vet when he called them, you know, he dragged him and then afterwards he said, you know, it's funny. We've Craig thousand cows this year and there was they were either shortbread or long bread.

It's let me explain this. This isn't my subject and I'm thinking in my head. Yeah. Oh, I got it. I got the other thing and I got it.	1.0
Oh, I fucking dude, I love and you can it's funny because you know, the people who buy shirts from Target like we have like an implicit like what's up when I recognize someone's wearing something.

No, but they could hold on we do no, no, no, but even just because they can doesn't mean they should like I just feel like they're what do they say most most complain? I have my see those computers that play Counter-Strike may not be able to take advantage of 128 take, you know, like stuff like that that we don't think about Out, you know, I think I think there must their time could be used more effectively. In other areas of the game. Wouldn't you agree?	-1.0

So I actually posted recently on my Instagram a picture and it was just like a picture of me and just like very open. So personally, I was always very shy and I never really wanted to try new things and I was very close and Just in general I would I like to be in my bubble and ever and ever like to try anything new. So she was always trying to get me to do different shows and whatnot. And then she always said to me trust the process. This is something that since I was a little kid she was just telling me non-stop if I always doubted my like if I doubted myself or whatever it was she said trust the process everything happens for a reason if your I remember just like losing one competition. We were like next in the final or something like that and I remember coming out of that cup. Shouldn't and I was just so sad. I was like, oh my God, whatever I'm doing. It's just not happening. It's I don't know. What like what what else could I possibly do to be in that final and this that and the other and she's like trust the process. It happened for a reason and it definitely did because I remember the next competition. I was so hungry for it and I wasn't I was just trying to do I wasn't trying to compete with anybody else. I was really just competing with myself and trying to improve myself more and I remember that petition ended up in the final and doing really well. So like things like that. She always let me know that everything happened for a reason and if something didn't happen it's meant to be that way and funny enough about two years ago. We tried out for Dancing With the Stars. Oh you did and we didn't get it and I was like all this you know, this is something I really want. I've I've always watched the show and I'm like super big fan and it's something I've always wanted to do. When we got the call that we weren't going to be on it. I was actually really sad and I was talking to her about it and she's like then it wasn't your time. It's right just continue doing what you're doing.

Well, I mean but with hard work, it's been taught before the 19th century Rhino new government that meant so meddling with with education really started only the 19th century before you had. I thought private Association that the church is in particular would take care of this. So it was not needed that anybody tax tax funded education either either Elementary education middle schools high schools throughout the university and so on it was just being handled anyway, and it's true. So this case great great latitude like greater responsibilities to parents who I'd known all parents will beat their children to high school or addicted to the you to the university and so on. Yeah, I think that that would probably the better situation than we have at present in any case people would have much sound ideas as far as all social political questions are concerned because they would not be systematically biased the system that we have right now. I know exactly how it is in the UK, but I see this year in France. And in Germany is the educational level diminishes every year and we've observed with for the past 40 or 50 years. I mean read the level of Education actually diminishes. So they're doing a very lousy job as far as the quality of education is concerned and if you listen to the education bureaucracy in France, the main concern is not really the level of academic achievement. It's equality. So they want to have student populace that is equal. So we want to prevent it some people get ahead of others and get a head start when it comes to the professional life. And so also they want Everybody to be on the same on the other on the start line at the age of 18 or 19 or whenever they leaving school. That's their main objective is not to teach anybody to help people. They just want to make them equal.	-1.0

Food part way through the game part of me does want to try out the new Firestorm for Battlefield because I do kind of want to see like, how are they going to how are they going to handle Vehicles? Because even though like the high-tier like armored vehicles, you have to go to like a specific spot on the map and then you have to work together. And if you work together from the way it sounds is that if you work together, you get the doors open faster and therefore you can get inside. But I would like to definitely see how they do it because if they can figure it out and then you know, obviously it's ETA. So like if they can figure it out and then maybe Titanfall kind of, you know looks over their shoulder and be like, okay, maybe tighten its can work together and try to make like add it to Em are br-2.

Jeffrey Simmons to the Broncos goes to their packers back on the board just in Lane was last one taken for the Detroit Lions Packers back up at pick number 44 other get names that came. Off the board where Jerry Tillery Jonathan Abram Greg Little a money or a Warrior from Penn State. Yeah, I need because you see from West Virginia.

Duke Dexter Lawrence the massive lemon from Clemson Debo Samuel South Carolina receiver Paris Campbell, Ohio State receiver, then a couple of safeties Deonte Thompson and Taylor rep are the top of the board right now one Thornhill not too far behind them either as well.

You think I should start off with I think you know having a combination of three things of doing some type of cardio some type of dynamic stretching and static stretching combination of both and also doing a combination of compound lifting and functional things is important. So an example for you, you know would be someone more from 5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill elliptical or StairMaster do a little bit of Mobility routine loosen up your hips because you down a lot loosen up your back foam roller. Been about 15 20 minutes on that. So look about 30 minutes of warming up where your body is, like actually sweating before you do workout and the great dead great compound exercise or deadlifts just important that you keep your spine neutral and I would definitely if there's one workout that I would like you to start doing it would be dead lifts, like straightening your back straight to New York or your glutes. It's a full body workout. So you're not a lot of birds with one stone with that one movement. I just got to make sure you do it correctly and then like a lot of stability core exercises and the cardio, you know, it's not again. It's you know, it's not about intensity is just about consistency, you know, you know that you know how to track your calories. You're pretty good at that quick question.	1.0

I'm like, I don't know if you have a dishwasher. I don't know how many dishes you have to do and things like that, but how we clean our bathrooms is pretty straightforward.

I think because over the years. I've managed to beat my body into submission, but it does what it's told but I've been I might not have been running Ultras went. 13 years or whatever, but I've been still running for a long time and I think that counts for something and I do strength training as well. Which for me everyone's different. So a lot of others don't do it and they seem to get by fine, but strength training really works for me and it helps me with my endurance. Maybe I am a bit Lucky in a way that I can recover quickly, but I tend to think not I don't think it's love. I think it's just persistence and just at the cumulative effect of Many years ago breathing. Yeah, I'm lucky. I don't really get major injuries. I had had hip adductor tendonitis in the past.

It's kind of like a celebration kind of I don't know if it has something to do like talking about Salinas, you know, the the Fiesta Mexican heritage Salinas rodale, you know, and just how the heritage is of it's a celebration more than just a two-hour rodeo in a few know and and you know my life she you know, everybody knows Haley she When she when she moved out moved out here and we started in started, you know going to the Royals but with me and you know, she had been out here a lot before as well, but before that but Morgan involved in the production and stuff like that, it was a it was a kind of a culture shock even for her being someone that did in the rodeo business. So for a lot of years to her dad and stuff and And then you know, they were raised under that Jerome Robby Robinson kind of Steel was it was it go into a building? It's a two-hour show, you know kind of almost like a concert you just went in and blew it out and it's not but they didn't when coming out here on the West Coast.

Very much is not child that authors hear me. I think it can work for a long time depends on the conditions also depends on how people act what what people will do it can act because we have very smart managers at the top of central banks who know the business, you know, what they can do if they cannot do we have generation of politicians who have enough equal. Reconstruction so that they know where they cannot exaggerate it with helping themselves through the printing press. All right, so there's some minimal discipline there. That's and they want to use really the printing press right now to be in Revenue. We're not at that point. Once you're at that point, then you're close to hyperinflation of closer columns, right? There was for example the situation in Germany after World War one and when they had huge public debt deficits for five years in a row, I mean Really huge and eventually, they just need the printing press to get the revenue because the taxes were no longer sufficient. Now even though President Trump has made some very considerable efforts in that direction of the huge deficit in the US as well. But nowhere near the situation which they would truly do need the printing press right right now they can help sell some of the current market. So as long as these conditions Prevail, I don't think we're anywhere near So drun finish stop stop of the this can last for a longer time, but he can't last indefinitely. Yeah, definitely.	-1.0

And so that also then also challenges how we think about Innovation and work programs in things that we can do to make the construction delivery process more effective like off-site construction. And I also think the dollar spent is smaller as well. Like you said you might have one off buyers or Construction Services or even if they're not one off they may build a project every five years. So you're essentially are a one-off type Builder or they're planning Horizon is Noah's law. So if Multi family developer or Builder cash right now. You're probably saying I hope I hope the music keeps playing for another 24 36 months and I'm running out this wave of multifamily boom, and I'm not really quite sure where this Market will be five years from now, whereas oil and gas and petrochemical owners there. They've got a 10 15 20 year view on the capital spent where that's going.	-1.0
Well, I was going to ask if I mean the back free I think that was one of the first times really we saw Cody then Duncan say sort of look pretty pretty solid. I know we've had previous games. We've spoke about it the Arsenal game and so on but forward touch on it now before we move on to the next game, how do you lot think that I know they didn't play that back for you today? But how do you lot think we've adjusted? Life without Willie Bali as well because I personally think it's doing a lot better than what I am.	1.0
He is the Beast somebody and I think that that's why because ultimately I think one of the reasons especially what what do we want to call them Timmy Mick em. He I think one of the reasons he was petty is because we didn't see Whatever. He was told the big picture was he couldn't show us the big picture and so all he saw was us being very upset and rightfully, so but instead of being like Oh, no, you're rightfully upset is just like will screw it. You know, you guys don't know what you're talking about and it's like yeah, we don't know and that's the problem is that we're reacting to this nonsense that you guys are throwing at us. I remember when we interviewed Chantal love her love her love her, but we are you know, Did you ever talk about steric onset? And she was like no, nope. Nope, never know and it was just like and then we asked her like who do you ship and she's like, oh, yes, Derek and never talked about it. All right, never ever ever never on set. You know, and I was like, I don't they're still a timeline of leadership that I'm very interested in it and that show because I was I was contacted which was interesting. Maybe because it was late. It was like 2015 but it was by a lawyer who used to work on the show. And so, you know just got some general Dietz that way because you know, he didn't have anything new of course, but the idea that yeah, there were these malls and you could see it sometimes in the writing but the problem was in trying to help us they ended up mucking up the cannon and mucking up the it even more because it's like I would kind of rather just have it Crash and Burn and just be mad at it than having these little things pop up or like oh wait, is that something and it's not them it wasn't them trying to give us hope but it was more like we see you.	-1.0

The latest episode of Fringe this was like seven years ago, and I'm going to fucking fold some laundry dodo and can't do that when you're doing dishes unless you have a little TV in your kitchen, which I don't or a little portable TV, which they used to have.	-1.0
This is the case when you're right. Yeah, maybe maybe I don't like it to sit with myself. I'm not sure like I that is another interesting point, which I don't have to get into on the podcast but I do think like when I am under stimulated I think about my health issues more like that is something I've noticed like for example, like on Shabbat when I like can't use the phone. I like TriCity talk to people do this whatever it is. Like I start like feeling my ailments or like all the ways that my lupus Our dorm affects me whereas like when I'm distracted and busy, I don't think about it. Well, this was so insightful. Yeah. Well, thank you so much. It's so nice to see you. Also. I mean even though it's virtual.	1.0
I was I literally walked away when I started talking about and I like, you know what no guy.	-1.0
I don't know if he's human because he was super hero. He was for how long was the show two hours and he was saying dancing talking playing instrument and this is all live it was not fake. Like this is all real stuff. He was it's like you can't fake that kind of stuff, you know, and he was just on stage non-stop. His quick changes were literally like 15 seconds. Wow, it was insane. Like he's just I don't know what he's made out of but that guy is so energetic and he's just so talented and being his partner on tour was actually the coolest experience ever and his fans were so supportive. And what I really liked about him was the fact that he took the time out of his day. He came out of his trailer signed everybody's autograph talk to people so he wasn't kind of like, all right. Thanks guys. Bye he was like, right so involved with his fans and that's so refreshing. Rushing to see and but then again like he treated us like royalty. He got us like spa days and massages to make sure our bodies were okay.	-1.0

It was easy to maintain and it reinforced the type of play. I wanted when someone would make a great play. There would usually be one or two girls yelling heart sticker. It was perfect fast forward to The Following season a few of the same girls are on my team and I'm excited to use stickers as bribery for good play yet again. I announce this to the team at our first meeting expecting the same excitement and enthusiasm which existed with my previous team. However, this group of girls was older and quite frankly not even mildly enthused about stickers Gotta Love high schoolers. I was a little taken aback. By their sideways glances and raised eyebrows, but just knew that once we started playing and they started earning their stickers. They would love it. This was never the case try as I might the stickers never stuck. I tried and tried but it eventually proved to be more of a distraction than a source of unity halfway through the season. I admitted defeat and ditched the stickers. If anything that experience taught me that I cannot force traditions on to a team, especially when they develop organically from a teammate. Up of completely different individuals. So when you are trying to create reinforcements of your preferred behaviors just be aware that some may not work as you planned and be okay with abandoning your efforts when you're positive. They won't catch on or work for your team. Try things out that worked for you when you played But realize that your team might not be as excited as you are just because something doesn't catch on initially doesn't mean it won't work. I enjoy mixing up teams and warm up Partners, but telling the girls to pick a new partner literally never works. And someone is always complaining it's horrible. I started asking my girls to line up alphabetically by their favorite color favorite flavor of gum favorite band Etc.	-1.0
Yes, of course the problems that will accelerate but you'll see that what it boils down to its the following right? I mean industry and eventually any sort of productive activity that is not related to tourism. So welcoming British Dutch Austrian and German tourists will just wither away.

And take that as broad or as narrow as you'd like, I think I think I spoke about it before was just educating people. I did find that quite a struggle at the beginning trying to even get in front of real estate agents and convince them that home staging was a benefit to them and it would help them sell properties faster.

So I'm Wondering how many people are like me I would like to I would like to see some kind of a breakdown of the analytics. Like how many people are really like the Mastiff for instance. I love the like, I think it was called The Warp Zone or something, but it pretty much look like a Nintendo controller and even have like Megaman on the screen or whatever but it's a Mastiff. You don't always get a Mastiff, but if you get like an R3 or re 99, you could get that every round if you really tried exactly right so	1.0

I think we're in a Content bubble. Because content bubble. Yeah, because people's Leisure Time Has stayed the same if not minimize. Like if not over time has become less and less like people's time to watch entertainment. But the more content that's being produced there less time like people like me have to consume it. So then we have to make choices like there's some good content that I won't watch. So at some point with all these Services coming in we're going to lose like the ability to even in participate or watch like great great shows so that much that's money lost. You know. Yeah that's sort of a and I choose and now for some reason I choose to consume less like easily accessible content over excellent content, you know, like instead of watching like Better Call Saul I'm going to instead opt for like a twitch stream because it's so accessible.	1.0
I don't know is that just has like it's like a nice blanket for all the older shows. Like I re-watched.	-1.0
Then we cover it with re calling because they've got an option on a character as well as well have my up front. So when I face Yugi can't record it now.

All of the safety equipment for the power shooting in the Foss driving out of helicopters and just it's you know, it's a big boys toy club.

One thing I did notice that they actually I thought was decent writing is that the way that Mama and Robbie race speak is similar, which is makes sense because they're supposed to be mother and son. Okay, especially also because they're from the same place. I thought it was I said great writing, but I think that's okay writing.

I know you tried give me all the jury Ellis situation, but you ain't no better. So I'm about to start my own company. So it'd be like they love eventually you realize it. Hopefully, you know, you do get that chance to realize before it's too late and a lot of these artists unfortunately did not get the chance and they did not realize it until again. It was too late and I didn't dealing with this situation and it's very sad man. Very very sad, but Again, we'll keep you up to date on this kind of situation is not looking good for him though. Just because they knew that we got today as a big yikes on this situation real big guys. They literally making this man to slave like how its worded that man's a slave right now. So although being really get out of there because I know this man is being stressed forever and this is just another another hurdle that hopefully he can get through if kind can get his master's dog.

Well then just think about remember at sdcc where they had that thing where they were reading the fan fiction. And in fact, that's kind of how we originally got involved with Edie and we were actually on her side because she was like that was disgraceful like they had him reading this big but it was purely to make fun of it and purely the laugh at the author was fine, but it was like still that's not a good look. Yeah. Yeah and And then that on top of Jeff's whole thing that Linden let slip where Jeff was like, you know, they told us no, in fact, I think Hoechlin even said it in an interview in Dillon to maybe we've been like don't look at any of the fan art don't look at any of the fanfic. I'll do that. I'll take care of that for you. I'll respond to that for you. You don't have to deal with that and I was just like side I now for the collective that what so the reason people found out about it. Is because a few people were invited to start adding their stuff to open it up and so the link and if there wasn't an announcement yet in the link wasn't public but just kind of threw, you know DM's and that kind of stuff people were beginning to know what it was. So when your post came out because I already thought it was shady. So in your post gave out we were like, oh, yeah, it's definitely Shady Shady boots, but like I think because like the big-name	-1.0

We have yet to fight good and he's just so inspiring to and you're not in a great mood. He knows how to like lift you up and make you feel comfortable. And I think that's what she needs as well because no one really knew what she can do on the show and you know, She's super talented when she does but no one has ever seen her dance before and that's difficult when you're not a dancer, you know, so I feel like he's the perfect partner for her to just make her feel comfortable and no matter what just support her and they work so well together. They have the best chemistry.	1.0

Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank. I'll be honest. I don't even know so first time because he always used to be	1.0
