1	This isn't for you. This is no please please keep going. Please. Keep going. No need to stop on the first floor. Keep it going to the third floor. So this is why you should keep your in person nudes and your electronic music lost the fuck up. Okay? Okay, but like let's talk about how well like Out to dinner and it's like Jaclyn will send nudes to no one and we start talking about who she's like what you want to see this one. This one me like going through her phone at the table. That's what if someone else sees them.	1.0
2	I'm like you got first of all last night I did that we were moved 47 times and we ended up in a table in the corner and there was no other tables there and I was just showing you and JJ I wasn't going to solve draw because he does not want to see a naked woman. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, but like that's different like you guys have you guys you have to see this? This like not gonna send it to like most people don't deserve my mood.

I'm going to send it to you and no one else exactly because I literally like Women bringing up women is like the best thing so when you're like girl, yes, you look amazing. Best feeling, you know, I like read a meme that said something like it's not a like, I'm bad at this Dad. I know you guys said something along the lines of like you don't have to like beat somebody you're in different races like the concept of kind of like you don't have to bring someone else down just to like succeed and I think that like, We need to continue that like culture around like bring other women up. Don't tear them down. Like we have enough people trying to like pull us back and we need to like help push each other forward absolutely to help each other find our good angles in life and in nudes facts. I love it. I got to be able to get it to you. Thank you so much. I strive to like bring that out in people. I think so if there's ever photos of me on the internet, I'm gonna blame you.	1.0

2	Yeah, I just feel like what is more empowering than like finding what you love about your body? What else is there in life? You know what? I mean? I agree. I think we criticize our self enough that like when you can find things you love hmm, like take it and run with it Jaclyn. What's one thing you love about your body? Just one thing. I know what I love about your body what you have the best behind you're gonna say that I mean, they're not bad. They're pretty good. You have like the opposite like you have the best ass. I do have a pretty good but I squat it's like lat imagine us as one person. Whoo-hoo that asked to boob ratio be wow.	1.0

2	Like I support you.	1.0
1	Yeah, thank you so much. I mean like sometimes it's like okay cool, LOL.	1.0
2	This is fine. But like it doesn't do much for me. Like what does it do for you? Tell me what it does for you. I so it depends I guess on the situation like I love a good dick pic because I just need all the information like I need to know what your dick looks like. It just makes me feel like we're a friends on a whole nother level. I love that but also like when you get a dick pic, and it's like I caused this dick. To be hard it is the most amazingly like makes me feel like the baddest bitch the hottest bitch, you know, like I did that I guess what I did. I've never thought of that right?	1.0
1	Doesn't it make you feel good?	1.0
2	Okay well and it's so we met the stranger will not a stranger like he was a friend of a friend when we went on a vacation recently. And he has this like trick that he does with his dick pics.	1.0
1	I was I literally walked away when I started talking about and I like, you know what no guy.	-1.0
2	So he like I guess he like does this thing where he pulls up a dick pic on his phone and then he puts the phone face down. He's like that's a dick pic. Listen, you don't got to trick me into looking at your dick pics. I'm not the fucking one. I need you to be confident and I need you to be like this as my dick pic. I would have A pick the phone up it would have stayed there for eternity didn't have to put the phone down just hand it to me.	-1.0
1	But I guess we all have our thing like that's his like trick that he likes to do II guess I can't call it a trick. It's not a trick. It's his life. He'll trick trick or treat. It's a treat for me but no the tree for me.	-1.0
2	So I guess we all have our thing. I'm just like like I feel like when you're like starting to date someone like when do you feel like would you ever like sent a nude if you were like dating someone I mean, yeah, I just feel like there's a time and a place like when is the appropriate time and place for you? It sounds like whenever whenever the inspiration strikes. Okay, but like say you're like talking to somebody new. How long do you wait to send one? What like 10 minutes?	1.0
1	No. No, I'm kidding.	1.0
2	I guess when you're feeling the vibe and if the vibe is like a half hour after you meet them or if the vibe is like six years after you meet them like when you're feeling that Vibe. Okay? Yeah, okay. I don't remember the last time I sent one to somebody other than you. So like I'm not sure but it's so funny though because I like love like an unsolicited dick pic. I think I'm in the minority of this category of women. That's like surprised me with a knife. little present like like I'm at work or I'm getting ready to go well and you're getting ready to go out. You're about to get in the shower. Send me a dick pic. I'll be like, yes. Thank you so much. I'll like maybe I'll someone back probably not probably felt like I don't know why I just love that like little surprised. Do you save them? If they send it through text, yeah, I don't delete any of my texts. Like what do you like save the photo to your photos or like you just leave it in the thread. I have saved them to my photos because like what of might accidentally get deleted but why do you need to save them because what if I want to look at it later, what if I put that like compare and contrast? Like I said if I could curate a whole Art Exhibit I said a museum earlier, but now it's an Art Exhibit that dick pic. I just feel like that's my what my life work should be.	1.0
1	You know, I don't know.	-1.0
2	I really don't know. Well, yeah, I just feel like what is more like delightful than a nice little deck on your phone like or it'll take on your phone? I didn't mean to say little because I've gotten a lot of big dick pics. I got me.	1.0
1	I would want to run away from that and I want to run towards it. I am slow motion.	-1.0
2	Very tiny.	-1.0
1	So like I'm good, okay, but act like you can't handle a big dick, please hardly. Mmm. You could handle it if you really had to if I had to if I was meeting to yeah, if it's like, oh, I like this deck or no ticket. I mean you would choose no. No, I'm not there's no digging. I often choose. No Jacob. It's like you can go to bed or you can like travel to a dick on.	-1.0
2	Like night-night doing on doing this. Yeah, I love it. So what's the advice that you would take from this episode?	1.0
1	I don't have to take advice from this phone because I keep my news locked up in a folder like this is what I'm telling you. What advice would you take my I love the advice from this episode is like take the news. Do you like true just like empowers powered for yourself take them in just like	1.0
2	Know that you're the baddest bitch. Yes, like feel yourself know yourself like in a really like intimate way right because gonna help so much young you're intimate with somebody else in like I think that is actually what I've realized over the years. Like I've been so much more like open and like willing to like put myself out there a little bit more than I'm used to because I like I'm starting to actually like myself. Oh, yeah, which is so great and I just feel like you Have to do it in your own way and if like you're not comfortable taking a nude, please don't feel like I'm forcing you to although one time. We did Force chaplain 2 times the first time but I have always just been a person I grew up in a naked house like that me my mom would was we were always naked like we had a pool we skinny-dipped before bed because like it was just cool our bodies down my moms, like don't even be naked in the shower.	1.0
1	You need to wear a bathing even in the shower.	-1.0
2	My mom is the most reserved person on the planet.	-1.0
1	So I'm like Committing a crime like every time I lovely when I walk on my home naked even though I live alone. I'm like, I'm gonna get in trouble. My mom used to sing this song. It would be like, I think it's like Age of Aquarius is the actual song, but she'd be like walking around naked is healthy. So my moms like my laptop, you can't do that like naked as a crisis in yeah.	-1.0
2	So I just feel like being very body positive and I try to like also like bring that out and others It's because I don't I don't think I've talked about this on the podcast yet. But I've had this like weight loss Journey where I was 300 pounds. I still like felt pretty good in my skin at that time. But I've lost like I don't know like a hundred and twenty pounds no big deal. It's like but like learning to like love yourself at both sides and seeing your imperfections because I still feel at this size like not good enough. And like not hot enough and what has really helped me accept myself is actually nudes. If I'm being 100% honest. I've gone from a size 0 to size 6 back down back up and I can find flaws at any size. But I think at some point you just have to look for the things you love as opposed to like picking out the things that you hate right and I still definitely picked myself up are same but it's so helpful to be like, oh my God look at me. I look at like what this body has accomplished always want to look at you. I always want to look at you and I do girlfriend. Look at them bubs. Oh my God, so I guess that's that's the T if you want to take a sip.	1.0
