1	Welcome to the construction Brothers podcast. I'm your host Tyler Campbell and with me like he is every week giving me a smirk my brother Eddie Campbell. That was just a smile. That was a smirk its mark means I'm up to something. Well, we got an awesome show for you. Today. We're going to be talking to mr. Tyler / a of f of my Consultants about Mega projects. We were really excited to get to that here. In a moment, but first things first, I'm like to bring something to your attention. No, no, no don't don't don't so it's been cold here in Middle, Georgia. Eddie of you. Have you noticed that it's been a little bit cold? Yeah, give the fact it was like 80 directly before the 29. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed Yeah, so in case you guys don't know we live in Middle, Georgia Middle, Georgia can't make up its mind on whether so we'll go from 80 degrees one day and 30 the next it will just drop overnight. It's absolutely insane. Yeah, actually did that last week it literally did so but here's the thing Florida also got smacked with this little cold front to and there was a little news article that HuffPost put up that I was Giggling at earlier. So some things are falling out of trees and they're not the Coconuts. Are they snakes? They're not snakes. I was hoping there was no not snakes. Again. We passed on that no coconuts and no snakes. They're not monkeys. What are they? So the National Weather Service Office in Miami tweeted don't be surprised. If you see iguanas falling from the trees tonight as lows drop. Up into the 30s and 40s, brr. Yeah, especially if you're an iguana, so it's something that they don't usually talk about and I've heard of this before whenever it gets really cold down in Florida iguanas start falling from the trees because they just they can't handle it. They're not dead. They're just Frozen. Well, they're cold-blooded. Yeah. Yeah, so cold weather is kind of tough on something like that counting that subsists because of the Sun and its heat when that goes away has a hard time. It's true. It's true, especially when in trees I'm going to read on a little bit so iguanas aren't dangerous or aggressive to humans, but the damage seawalls sidewalks and Landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. Actually. I didn't know that did you know that a Guam has dug tunnels? No. That's kind of terrifying that's news to me. It's like a dinosaur digging a tunnel a mini dinosaurs a micro dinosaur building a tunnel it is I wonder if elon's going to like get 200,000 iguanas and like try to get them to dig tunnels under Ela or so. That's how he's gonna get us how he's gonna do it. He's not actually going to use a machine. He's just going to get all of the iguana's he's got a tiny Army of iguanas. To dig his tunnel under Los Angeles. I mean the man's genius secret. That's the secret. What you do is you have to harness them together. So you get to Belt any straps groups of ten together and then he makes this massive circle of iguanas that he just sets underground and they start chopping away does the circle spin I think so like a carousel. Yeah. It's like a vertical Carousel with iguanas. Yeah. He leads them. Buying by using electric heaters. So he basically entices them with a heat source. And so they move towards the heat source. It's science everybody history. It's mr. Tyler Perez going to be proud of this intro I can hear now. Hey, man, you should have done your research before getting interviewed by us. You didn't know you didn't know. I don't know nothing about nothing. But that intro man. We are smart around here at school this week. I would like to introduce a new segment and we're going to call that segment. Shower thoughts buckle up. For those of you that don't know there is a subreddit called our shower thoughts on it. You can scroll through and a lot of people just post their post their shower thoughts on there. And a lot of these are are quite interesting. So I kind of wanted to take some time today and read them to you and I figured we'd all have a nice little chuckle about this and or Break our brains a little bit just because of how awesome these are they deep. Some of them is this like deep thoughts. Let me give you the let me give you the first one on my list. Okay, if your thumb is chopped off you lose your middle finger. Yeah. Okay, I can see how this would be a mind-blowing thing. More people have stood on the moon then on your desk. That's not true. Is it not know how is it not true because more people have stood on my desk. No, it's not. How do you know who stood on your desk? Why are you standing on your desk for what have you stood on your desk? I've never stood on my desk. So how can you make this argument? Because somebody else has who small people though? We're not going there. Why can't I talk about my kids on the show man? I'm gonna he's not. Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, I thought you were going another way with that. But yeah, okay fine. No Tyler. I was not and I would like you to go read the employment posters now because spiders mold every time you think you see a dead spider you might be looking at the skin of a live spider that is now larger than it was before. I did not need to hear that today. No, I know you love spiders. Yeah - there are gallons of saliva traveling through the postal system at any given moment. I have a question. What do you like licking stamps and envelopes? Sometimes they had I don't know how you feel man, really mixed emotions. Yeah, really mixed emotions. Some of them actually taste. Okay, if you think about it, it's kind of got a muted taste. It's not anything earth-shattering. It's not like Gordon Ramsay himself cooked something and slathered like some broth on the outside of the envelope for you to lick. Okay, let me bring this full circle. Okay. Is there a market for envelopes that taste good? I think there is actually there are envelopes out there that tastes good are there. Yeah, I think there's there's why with me yeah, this is too obvious. Yeah. Like popcorn slathered in butter. That's terrible. Here's one for you. All numbers are closer to 0 than they are to Infinity. I just watch Teddy's head explode. Okay. All right here. Oh, okay. Now here's one dentist study the dangers of plaque in order to receive a plaque that says they can remove your plaque. That's a lot of levels of plaque it is it's like plaque exception. How do you feel about flying? I think that it's a good idea. And most of the time I leave it at that I always bleed every time I floss then the lady over at the dentist's office is always like this because you don't floss and I'm like, but I bleed when I flies I'm like so you're telling me that I would build calluses between my teeth and my teeth holes that would it would prevent the bleeding. And your and your teeth Caverns dude. I I I call Shenanigans. I think big floss is out to get us probably is yeah. Yeah. No, this is all just a racket and all the Mr. In it. They're out there trying to sell their Wares trying to sell us string string with mint flavoring on it in some cases. You know what all this time. They could be tied in with the envelopes to the the people that make the tasty envelopes. Because you think about it. It's the same technology. You're applying Taste of paper, you know, like or like string or like textiles you haven't lived though until you got that piece of popcorn stuck in your teeth in the floss comes in for the rescue and saves the day I got used to do that. No, that's your penalty for eating popcorn. I refuse to use no, I will not use floss to dislodge a popcorn brightest popcorn have to have any kind of punitive value attached to it because Because when it comes out you can eat. So you're saving it for later? Yeah gives you it gives you something to do. What do you think of beards for? Well, why do you think I have a beard to save it for later? Obviously. It's crumb catcher. That's what it is. It's your peanut butter and jelly for lunch. By the way, I didn't have peanut butter and jelly belly. Well that's even scarier than what's in my beard. All right. Well, let's let's move this thing along. Let's talk about Tyler / a so he came in and he wanted to discuss mega-projects FMI is really huge in finding reports and collecting information and spreading that out to people Eddie. I feel like this was more Show then mine listening back to it because you had you just nerded out on a lot of these factoids. This is just right in your veins. So I think I think we should just call this one the Eddie show. Haha. Yeah now I still construction Brothers man. No, no, it's the Eddie show. Okay. Yeah, but I think I said like two words and you hear a chuckle from me. All right, that's it. Everybody comment if you like that format and everybody comment if you miss me. Mom that's that's shit. I'm looking at you that's dangerous man. He had me nerding out because I'm I'm curious about what's going on in construction. Mmm, and he's got he's got research to back up the things that he's saying. Yeah, and so when he's coming at us talking about mega-projects talking about market trends talking about what's going on with Our labor shortages, he has resources and knowledge to back that up. And I think that there is going to be a lot of value to this show. Mmm. Maybe not just may not be for absolutely everyone. I think it's going to be intriguing for most. Yeah, and there's a lot of content here that I feel like just great content, but I do see people that are on the front end of construction trying to decide what they're doing. With projects and how they're how they're going about business right here in a lot of value here. One of the things that really stuck out to me back to the labor shortage. He was saying that we lost a lot of that labor back in O8 during the crash. Yeah, they left and they just never came together came back. And so that is something that we're facing now and something that gets a code often is we need labor. I don't know how many times I've read articles in the recent past that say, I mean, Can too are you a human being do you have a pulse? And those are your requirements? Do you know how to get out of bed? Like we're that starved for Laborers. I'm only being a little silly. Yeah, like I have read articles that are really not far off at in construction Publications. And so yeah, I mean talking about that the Scout of be something of interest to people listening if you're in the construction industry and you have to Source labor, I know that's something We experienced here. Yeah, how do we find talented people get them here retain them train them the way we do things and then leave and effective team. Even if you're a labor in you know in the workforce right now, this could be encouraging to you, you know, and maybe you could start looking at things that you do in a different way that hey maybe I can leverage this. Maybe I can leverage these skills that I have to build up a business, too. Fit in to that that missing piece in our industry. Maybe you can digital. Yeah, maybe you can just realize that you are a valuable part of the industry. You are. Yeah and that your commodity it's hard work, but we appreciate everybody out there doing that every single day. Yeah stay at it. Yeah. All right guys, well, we're going to go ahead and move along and we're going to get into our episode with Tyler Gray. All right, Tyler. Thanks for joining us today.	1.0
2	Why don't you tell us who you are and what you do is I work for a company called Decima Corporation or a boutique Professional Services firms that provides Consulting and investment banking services to the built environment. We defined the built environment is is anything that really touches or Relates to the bill world, we work with contractors. We work with Engineers Building Product manufacturers construction material producers on the investment banking side of our business. We are helping companies transition ownership either internally within their own organizations or through m&a activity and doing buy sell or sell side representation and on the Consulting side of our business where I reside our Consulting business really provides, Advisory services in the areas of leadership strategy and performance, you know, I help lead our performance practice. I've been with FMI now for eight years and most of my time is spent in the market working with contractors. And so probably 200 days out of the year. I'm somewhere in North America sitting in the contractor's office helping them solve challenges relative to the performance of their organization.	1.0
1	I'm interested in what you call prefabrication modularization because from my reading on your background and the things that you're studying out it would seem that you have much larger projects in view than are in view. Typically when we're talking like a modular bathroom solution and so prefabricated and modular Solutions. Like how big are we talking? Like? What would be an example of a large prefabricated? Element.	1.0
2	Yeah, so we that's a really great question and you depending on who you ask and Industry you get different answers around that, you know for your commercial guys. They're looking at you know, what can be what could be marginalised in a commercial building. Right? And so that really speaks to things like bathroom pods or you know, anything with a bed really is replicable. So if you think about multifamily product launching even health care hospitals mean one of my clients ones don't The hospital is really just a hotel with Med guess and so it's it's maybe a little bit more complex modularization, but that is really where we think of modularization on the on the commercial side of things on the on the industrial side of things because the downtime is so expensive and an industrial environment. There is a much more incentive to explore off-site construction and push the boundaries of what could really be accomplished through modulars. Ation, and so the modules that you are seeing in the industrial environment are massive large to the extent where some of them can't even be trucked in other being shipped down rivers or up rivers or across oceans, you know from one side of the world to the other massive ships. You're seeing this very very large Mega units modulized units and it's because of the complexity of the work in the preciousness of So time in that industry in oil and gas to wear weeks mean millions of dollars for an operation and if I'll that can be constructed in another facility either in another state on the other side of the globe and be shipped in just in time to be put in place with minimal disruption to operations. That's really the advantage.	1.0
1	Yeah, we're talking barges with 50 tons of steel substructure and process piping Etc going down the river. Ever to be installed at a plant.	1.0
2	Yeah. Yeah, and there's been and so I think when you think about particularly in this audience, the construction users Roundtable, which is comprised of a lot of industrial owners. All side says something they're pretty familiar with and it's really their conversations are how do we continue to push the envelope? How do we do more of it? And how do we get the rest of the industry on board namely contractors and I think - real space is an area where owners have really been leaders and that regard because the incentives are there two things off site or as maybe you look at the commercial side of the industry where commercial owners have kind of said well contractors can go figure it out. And if you can deliver a building faster or cheaper through off-site construction, we'd be interested in contractors go. Okay, great. We're not Apple or Google and we'll have billions of dollars worth of R&D to go figure this out come up with a new mouse trap. So it's innovation in manufacturing and off-site construction is sort of limped along this some extent and the and the commercial space because there's been a lack of funding or interest or incentives on either contractors around or side on the big stuff.	1.0
1	What's the biggest challenge and implementing off-site construction prefabrication? Is it just Logistics? Is it insurances? Is it illegal? Here's the thing. What is the common thing people? Stop their toe on?	-1.0
2	Well, I think what we've noticed and talking when owners and studying. This is just a lack of vision at the onset of the project if owners and contractors alike are coming into a particular project opportunity and they're aligned on what possible from an off-site standpoint that really bodes well for maximizing the prefabrication or off-site potential on the project. It's I think it's what works hard as if there's a basic project that gets design and then a contractor or a contractor in a designer than says all right, what part of this can we can we manufacture off-site since having that alignment going in from the beginning with owner the engineer and a contractor all aligned saying this is this is really how we want to achieve this any kind of modular design any kind of prefabrication off-site construction really originates in the planning period of the construction process, right?	1.0
1	And so we're talking about getting alignment out of the people that initiates in the commercial space. We're just not seeing that alignment.	-1.0
2	Is that what you're telling us a couple of the challenges that you have is the fragmentation of the market and you look at owners that say take a multi-family developer. For example, these may be small family offices that are throwing up maybe a couple of products every few years and they're not what we would Define as cereal buyers a construction services. And so when they go to develop a apartment Complex, they say right? What's the lowest cost that I can get this at the make the pro forma work not what would be the lowest cost at scale? If I was to build a thousand of these things some of your more your larger owners more Progressive owners think of a hotel flag like a Marriot. They are fully bought into the concept of modularization because I know they're going to be building hotels from now until the foreseeable future and the more cost-effective way. They can do that. They're interested in that and a big way. So at bathroom pain that's built in Miami or bathroom fathers built in Seattle. They're all for standardization Montreux zation and making their buildings more efficient from a construction standpoint because the scale and the dollars that have Place think of the same thing for somebody like a Facebook or Google that's going to be investing in billions of dollars worth of data centers over the next decade. Those are the folks that are really lean in same. All right, if we're able to save one percent on Ten billion dollars worth of construction that's real dollars that that that's a conversation. We're worth having if it's a fifteen million dollar apartment complex that only means, you know 1% of that to one owner. It doesn't get a whole lot of attention and when you see the magnitude of dollars that are spent on a sort of capex and the industrial face those are big dollars and the opportunity time the down time relative to construction or maintenance in those plants has big dollar. As well, so it's really the magnitude of the opportunity that gets people's attention. Otherwise, it's just something neat to talk about, you know, can we build something offsider prefab and slide and employees great. But what does that mean for either the economics of the project itself or the overall business?	1.0
1	I'm gonna play dumb here minute and trust me. It's not going to take too much work. Thanks Lane capex to me. You said capex explain that to me.	-1.0
2	I'm just capital expenditure. So Investments that are made by businesses into property plant and equipment. So real assets that are either either viewed as new construction or additions to existing assets capex is big-time and industrial space, you're talking billions of dollars for you know, the large energy providers of the folks that are in oil refinery businesses or Midstream transmission oil and gas in there's a lot of dollars at play there. And so When you when you have a program of construction the stretches billions of dollars you start to look at that holistically as to how can we improve our productivity our efficiency are cost particular when you have repeatable structures and repeatable product type. How can we become more efficient of that over time? And that's really where off-site construction becomes really attractive.	1.0
1	I read where you'd said the big disconnect many of today's capital projects our Enos driven not execution driven. What did you what did you mean by that statement?	-1.0
2	Yeah, so that really ties to a lot of the research that we've been doing over the last three years on what we call mega-projects mega-projects find US capital intensive projects that require multiple teams pull off and they usually in excess of a billion dollars that we've seen have created lots of stress on the industry and on stakeholders within the industry owners designers. And and contractors and what we mean by you know, those the challenge for those projects being business-driven is going to take a large NFL stadium. For example, we have some sort of deadline that we've established for the stadium open probably based on kickoff of game one a couple Seasons from now and so we've got to figure out how to pull together the capital and power the contractor to the designed to get that accomplished within a another find window not necessarily. Taking the other crochet if we were going to build a structure like this, logically and efficiently, how long would it take? You know, we may be three season from now that that Stadium would logically be open and could be built in a way that the the labor market could provide sufficient labor. The contractors could do sufficient planning. The designer would have enough time to thoroughly designed the building to the extent that it's ready to be constructed by a contractor. It's the business pressures and that's just one example, you can apply that to really any project where there's a economic outcome a reason why they're every every project as an impetus for being constructed and if it's a private project because the return on investment the people are looking for if it's a public project is that there's a public use right and and those deadlines are driven by really the reasoning behind them project and that's very well understandable, but I think some of those deadlines of expectations but the public eye and from a business TenPoint have outstripped the capacity the construction industry to deliver on those expectations. And that's where we really see challenges. So back to the stadium example, we want to build a stadium in two years great. We don't have the local label Market to support it. We don't have time to pull the design together and we would stress the contractor Community to build it but we're going to try to do it anyways and roll the dice and see what happens and sometimes when you see favor welcomes, but more and more on these large projects. We are seeing unfavorable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.	-1.0
1	Stood in the statements you were making about Syria being a suit serial Builder and I've heard it said in the past and I believe this was amongst commercial users that 90% of the things that are built are built by a one-time owner. I don't know that I could substantiate those statistics at this point because that's probably 10 to 12 years old in anecdotal at best. But are you seeing that as kind of the Difference Maker it seems like that's what picture you paint. That's the Difference Maker between a large industrial users is that they've got the capital in the know how to plan? Whereas these commercial users that are in there from one time. They don't have the capital to know how or the care because the savings aren't large enough to go into it with a mentality of we're going to prefabricate. We're going to modularize we're going to do off-site construction. Is that fair to say?	-1.0
2	Yeah. I think the stakes are much higher and the industrial environment. It's on the business disruption side. So lost Revenue, Related to construction activity. That's a huge driver as well as just the magnitude of their construction spin. So they're looking at it from both sides right there looking at it from how long is it going to take to construct this new plant or retrofitting existing plant? And what's the overall cost of construction services that I'm going to you know that I'm gonna spend on construction services over the next 10 years and and they are capital planning on that type of arising Capital planning in commercial. Environments tends to be a shorter Horizon. And so that also then also challenges how we think about Innovation and work programs in things that we can do to make the construction delivery process more effective like off-site construction. And I also think the dollar spent is smaller as well. Like you said you might have one off buyers or Construction Services or even if they're not one off they may build a project every five years. So you're essentially are a one-off type Builder or they're planning Horizon is Noah's law. So if Multi family developer or Builder cash right now. You're probably saying I hope I hope the music keeps playing for another 24 36 months and I'm running out this wave of multifamily boom, and I'm not really quite sure where this Market will be five years from now, whereas oil and gas and petrochemical owners there. They've got a 10 15 20 year view on the capital spent where that's going.	-1.0
1	It feels like there's a lot that can be learned. I mean these Mega projects let's go in That a little bit just the percentage of construction that's going to be done that's represented by Mega projects in the coming years.	1.0
2	Yeah, that's a great point. And one of the things we've noticed is it's been uh, it's been small single digits over the past in 15 plus years and we're projecting it to climb to almost a third of the construction starts in terms of dollars spent and that's a that is a huge shift in the way in which projects are built and it's In amount of large projects and the challenges they're becoming is proliferation of these large projects and the experience on them is largely bad from a cost standpoint from a schedule standpoint. We are seeing as I mentioned this at the Kirk conference from our point of view and working with contractors. We're seeing lots of what I will call voluntary exits from a space. So contractors that are saying we've gotten into these large projects we've had bad. Experiences we've lost a ton of money in the case of some public companies. We've lost a lot of Share value and we are strategically pivoting out of that market and we are going to go find work elsewhere. Well what other contractors participate in the reproductive and then there are you know, sort of what I've referred to as the involuntary exits is we have seen a lot of in the past 24 months is contractor bankruptcies, even for some of the largest companies in our industry that go belly-up as a result of being involved. These big projects that get sideways and they can they can take down even even a really large contractor.	1.0
1	So very interesting. I'm curious me. Yep. You've got your fingers on the pulse of this industry from the standpoint of what's coming and going what we're going to see in the coming years. What are you interested in?	1.0
2	Like, what's got you entry what's got you peaked right now really interested to see, you know, we get asked all the time. When as the recession coming in we were on the largest expansion Area Cycle from a building. Environment standpoint that we've ever been on in kind of recorded history. And so everyone's waiting for the other shoe to drop and for there to be some sort of Market pull back, but barring any sort of mega event. We don't see a giant monolithic downward shift in the construction industry happening like in 2008 where the music just stopped overnight. We do see pockets of the industry from a sector level and a geographic level that will begin softening, you know at different rates. I'm going to different times but I'm most interested to see how contractors react to that change and markets and I think contractors this time around have been more sobered and more cautious and maybe more paranoid than contractors were in a seven and a way where if you flash back to 2007 times were good. There wasn't a lot of people that were scared of a downturn and then boom all of a sudden. We were caught in a new reality. I think you flash forward to today and it's almost the opposite mentality that we see in the marketplace where as people are constantly paranoid about when the market is going to ship that they're thinking about today how to prepare their Organization for living in a different tomorrow is so so we have we have a lot more confidence. I would say from a broad sense that the contractor Market is much more prepared to deal with a recession than they were in. Seven or at least they thought about it and planned about it more now. It's still probably be painful for some but I think the construction in secret could probably use a slight pullback for the amount of stress that's out there right now on labor markets for my stress. It's on contractor balance sheets currently as they're trying to execute all this work slight cooling off period although I don't never with the recession on on any industry or any economy a slight cooling off period could actually be a chance. Or the construction industry in North America to catch its breath.	-1.0
1	Where do you see a softening up? I'm real Curious and that's all that's sounds to me on the surface like pretty good news. But where do you see it softening?	-1.0
2	Yeah, so and that is that is also really based on where you are in the country that we see in certain markets where you've had over expansion particularly multifamily. We do see it maybe not cooling off as the Word, but returning to normal, so Manhattan is a great example of this the multi-family residential boom in Manhattan. They were the let them in the market has doubled over the last five points there. And so it's going to pull back it's going to come back off of highs from probably probably do the extent to 25 30 30 percent decline of construction put in place, but it's still going to be a big building Market. It's just going to pull back quite a bit and it won't be as crazy competition will be fiercer DC star. Going to pull back a little bit in terms of Spin and so in certain Pockets where you can wrap intention Nashville's a great example, we've had rapid expansion over the last several years. We see a leveling off and maybe even a slight pullback, but you're also seeing a rotation and Healthcare sector fewer and fewer large sort of bed Tower Hospital projects coming out of the ground seeing a shift towards more. If you look at spaces like Hospitality hotels are going up all over the place, but the economy is good. Some people can afford to travel and so who broke warmest support the fact that what we've got more Travelers we ought to have more Hotel Beds.	-1.0
1	We always kind of wrap up here with the same question. If you had a megaphone and you could speak to the whole construction industry and tell them the best thing, you know, and you had 60 seconds to do it. What would you say the best thing that I know project selectivity?	1.0
2	I think this kind of weaves into a lot of things that we've talked about today. We work with hundreds of contractors every year and we see the whip statements see the balance sheets. You see the income statements and otherwise good or excellent year for a contractor can be wiped out by one or two bad projects. And if you wind the tape back on those one or two bad projects there was probably a lot of warning signals that happened during the pursuit phase as to it was a project larger than we've ever built. Or was a new owner that we've never worked with or gosh at a time. We didn't think we quite had the team to do it and she's like a culmination of a lot of those factors that result in a really bad project and for contractors projects from my margin standpoint for my project Sim profit standpoint can go marginally better, but they can go infinitely worse. And if I had a megaphone to speak to the construction industry would be to really hone in. In on Project selectivity particularly now at the top of the market cycle when there's more opportunity than there has been in recent years and contractors. I think have I will say the luxury of being more selective being more intentional about the types of work that they take on what Tyler thanks for being with us today. Thank you. It's been a pleasure.	1.0
1	Hey guys, Tyler here. Thank you so much for joining us today. I would point you to a couple things before you go as always look at the show notes.
