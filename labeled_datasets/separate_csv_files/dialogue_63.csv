What are you going to do lock into what you want and lock out everything that wants to keep you from getting there but makes you feel happy and fulfilled what lights you up from inside. How do you want to feel as Person, it's the time when you're feeling like you're scraping the bottom of the barrel you're in the dark, but it's up to you to change your perception to shed some light on where you are. It's the time when you're ready to give up. But you know, if you do you'll never be able to live with yourself with the guilt and shame of not pulling yourself out of this state become your biggest support system. You can't keep allowing the lack of support from others to discourage you to the point where you don't take action and you end up giving up. Up on your dreams overnight success of the fantasy but real success is within your reach no matter who you are no matter where you are at in your life right now for you to pull your way back out of where you put yourself in understand it.

So most people stop but successful entrepreneurs evide Learners and groups and individuals know, The Becoming better as a continuous consistent process not a game where the night sometimes we get too hung up on who doesn't support our Dream, right? My wife doesn't support my dream. My husband doesn't support my dream. My parents don't believe in my dream. Well, let me ask you a very important question. Do you support your dream your gifts your Billings your value? It's about you. You created the pot. You already lined the white and inclusive. It is now easier to identify the things that need to be learned from now you own it. You've heard of the instant success stories the Legends the Trailblazers the Rocks aren't they are the ones we Envy the other ones we want to be the stories. I've heard about people who achieve overnight success. They're just stories. It's a lot sexier to say someone just showed up and success rained down on them, but it's not the truth. There's always a hidden backstory of hard work of A lot of pain no one gets to the top without identifying what success feels like for them without sticking to it for 10 years or more without mastery. If you can't think if you can't bring yourself to move out of your current mental state to one of growth purpose and progress. I want you to follow me. Take a deep inhale. Ask yourself. What you need in your life right now close your eyes and exhale into the vision you have for your life. It's going to allow you to climb back out of the hole that you put yourself in shed light on your current position and be grateful for the experiences that are now about to take place. I'll ask you now. What is above you what's in front of you. You can't go any lower you spiral down as far as you can go. The only Direction now is up. All you have to do is just move that one inch many people won't understand why you're grinding they won't understand why you're attending masterminds and private workshops instead of partying all night long at the club. They're not going to understand that, you know that short-term sacrifices lead to long-term prosperity. Sometimes you need to let go of what you want now to get what you want later, but it's worth it because you're playing the long game success takes time success takes effort. But I promise you that when you finally get there, you'll look back at all of it, and you won't regret a single moment. They will understand that you're building a lifestyle that most people only dream about adding value that will pack the thousands of people and that what you do will leave a legacy long after you're gone from this Earth. They're not going to understand any of that and you know what you shouldn't care if they understand this or not. He's the thing to people can get to the one destination they can get to the same destination. But who's stronger at the end the one who had it easier or the one who started further back who started in a deeper hole who had to overcome more adversity those two people are going to get to the same spot the same destination. One of them is going to be stronger. Your only objective is to lock in on what you truly want for your Life so from now on get rid of the things that are just a distraction if it doesn't fall in alignment with your goals your values the direction you want to go and the place you want to be it is not for you. You need to Define your teeth aim not someone elses. The only way to achieve success without giving up on your happiness is to understand and Define. What is it? Like for you? You got to understand that when you have a vision or a great purpose to add value to the world. This is your journey alone to travel you need to clean yourself to look further than a few months a year. What do you want to do? Do and have at that time. Who do you want to be? How do you want to serve and contribute when you have that vision gets real with yourself and ask what needs to happen now to make that Future Vision my reality. So I take a deep inhale stand up straight lift your chin off your chest pull your shoulders back and start to look in the direction of where you want to go move that each when you get to that. State creating results in your area of expertise is almost effortless. It's an organic process that comes easily to you. Remember the further you spiral down just means the more growth there is on the way back up in the stronger you'll be and you're still waiting around for some kind of signal to finally go hard and give your dreams everything. You got stop seeing it as work ahead of you, but there's only growth ahead of you. There's only That can be had that's it. You can only go up from here and the growth is needed to be where you want to beat. I want you to tell yourself right now that you don't need permission to pursue your dreams. Not my permission not your family's permission not loved ones. Not any expert who rules or anybody else. Never needed anyone else has permission to tap into your greatness. The only kind of success that matters is the kind that lasts if you achieve success only to have it slip through your fingers. All you have then is Disappointment understand that you can't change what you've done wrong, but you can change your perception of it and that's what's going to help you move that inch.	1.0
