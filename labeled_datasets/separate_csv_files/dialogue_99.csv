If you've read my bio or the summary of the podcast you see on there that I am calling myself the mother of all mothers. So I wanted to explain that definitely in this episode. So I'm obviously a mom of multiples. So that's one type of mom that I am the second kind of mom is just being a bonus mom. So I do have a bonus daughter. So for those of you that don't know what that is. That means she's my step kid. She's my stepdaughter. She is what I like to call my part-time kid. We have her 10% of the time and she has with her mom 90% of the time so we have her basically two times a month and In that short time frame she gets to hang out with the kids which are her siblings and her dad. She is not vegan. I think that one time she did try and attempt to be vegan. She was vegan for the weekend and she it was really funny watching her. Look at the ingredients the way I do and she'd ask me is this vegan is this vegan and I'd guide her through it and then next time we picked her up. She was like, yeah. I know. I ate a hotdog and I'm like, wow, it was really funny. And she said no.	1.0
