      " Hello today our hearts wanted to talk about dreams coming true. And so it isn't.\n",
      " So as the art of intentional creation implies, we have these conversations because we seek to intentionally create the experiences of Our Lives which really means that we're here to make our dreams come true and surprise surprise. They do. Yeah. It's the most amazing feeling dreaming Quinto reality.\n",
      " Yes, you know when we were talking about this conversation prior to going live here we talked about how it's kind of like giving birth to something when you start, you know, in the depths of your imagination and you know, you just have this idea and you're like, huh? What would it be like if and then, you know fast forward however much time you know, and then it's like you're actually having that experience.\n",
      " In 3D reality and it's it's so sweet. Oh, it is so sweet and it all starts with an intention like you said. Yes, that's that we start paying attention to what's coming to us what wants to manifest in our reality? And do you ever notice things?\n",
      " Things can a reoccurring in your life it just like you maybe first become aware to something and you just notice it being there among other things being there.\n",
      " Pops up again and then again and then you really start noticing it and you think oh, this is interesting. This is the third of the this was brought up in a conversation or I've noticed in somewhere. I had a dream or I had a thought or had a feeling and it kind of becomes crystallizing itself extending out from the background. Maybe I'm other things that are also popping up because I think that there's always multiple things are\n",
      " coming right life is very complex. Yes, but then there is this something that kind of its kind of like when you go to a party and that is like, you know 50 people but you notice this one person for whatever reason and then you cannot you may be talking to other people yet in a corner of the eye you somehow like register their presence for whatever reason that is because there is an attraction or because you like how they carry themselves for you making up they are or whatever else, right?\n",
      " Secondly, they are popping out much more for you than the other 40 people in a background or a day just as present. Yes. So I feel like the first step to manifesting dreams is just that paying attention to what's coming up. Yeah when it comes up and yeah, it's just say I think really you I love the party analogy you gave right there. It's there's something about the way it feels that gets our attention and and I\n",
      " I don't know if they're always immediately present to that like oh this is this is a feeling that I'm getting we just like, oh for some reason out of all the things that I can be paying attention to right now. This has my attention. Why is that and I really think it's because there's something about the way that it feels and you know talking about in the context of creating dreams into reality or giving birth to a dream into physical reality. A lot of times it starts with a feeling that we kind of\n",
      " a little taste of and then we're like\n",
      " More of that I want more of that and there's a begin to focus on it. That's when it's like okay starting to plant the seeds for what then begins to grow into a dream.\n",
      " Mmm, yeah, I agree with you. It sounds like first is paying attention to what's coming up and noticing. Wow. This thing is coming up strongly for me. Why is that it like I said, it feels good. There is some kind of drawn some kind of attraction to it. It's there's a cool. Right? Something is pulling me to it. There is an air energy there right at strong cut it cut it like a Vibe right electrical current and and I\n",
      " You in your heart. Yes.\n",
      " Your heart gets happy gets excited. Yes and wants to explore more of it. Yes. It's a hell. Yes. I wanna see what's there? Yeah.\n",
      " Right because for now is just just say idea. It's not something known yet. It's just something that kind of reflects the light and your goal. What's this? I want to get close they are when I explore it.\n",
      " Yes, yeah in and out of out of that peaking of the interest we can we can call them fix your interest kind of catches your attention out of that can start to form an idea. So again talking about dreamings coming true dreams coming true. We're talking about this idea of how do I get get clear on something that I want to experience and then walk it through this process.\n",
      " Of building it in my imagination and then stepping into it in my physical life to the point where I can touch taste see smell talked to interact with hug. Whatever it is, right? Like how do I bring something from the Ethereal imagination plane down to the physical material plane? And I think that if we're going to go all the way back to the the Genesis the very very beginning of creating a dream, I think.\n",
      " Starts with exactly that there's this moment where you're like something gets your attention your like there's something for me here.\n",
      " And then when you are attuned enough to your own State your own your own level of presence your own interaction with life to where you notice these things they kind of feel like an invitation or kind of feel like, you know, like you said look your heart responds to it. And when you're in tune with your heart to where you feel your heart respond to it. It's an invitation to begin to dream into it and say what is it that's here for me. What what is this an invitation?\n",
      " He seoun, you know, that's kind of like you said it's like a current like an electrical current or like something drawing you in like what what is what is what is happening here? What is the opportunity to be kind of drawn into to begin to really explore what this feeling in my heart is\n",
      " I love that. You know what came to me now sits in jail use the word in tune to be in tuned with something coming up. And what popped up for me immediately was yes, when we notice that something is in tune for us to answer the calling to actually say yes to it. Hmm. Sometimes we have a tendency to this me sad because I feel like\n",
      " Sometimes it's close to abstract unusual, maybe different unknown and there is not enough belief.\n",
      " Two or maybe imagination of a go. How could it even be possible? It's so Out Of Reach.\n",
      " Right, which I love what you said. They're like, oh it can lead us to just kind of dismiss it, you know, like like when you know a lot of times when you hear somebody tell us about an experience that they've had where we find ourselves comparing their experience to experiences that leave had and when it feels like their experience is very different than anything we've experienced. We can be left sitting in this feeling of like wow. I'm glad that worked for them.\n",
      " But I've never experienced anything quite like that. And because I don't have a reference experience to relate to it really feels like I could never have an experience like what they had. Mhm. Yes, like I don't have evidence supporting the I could write therefore. Maybe I sometimes had that in the past when I would be drawn to something, but I would be maybe afraid to answer the call and actually say yes to it for\n",
      " That exactly thing because it felt so unreal. So unusual so Out Of Reach. Mmm-hmm. So I feel like that leads us to step to believe hmm. Yeah that when we paying attention and something is coming up and we think in tune to it right to actually have enough Believe in Us to an tend to have the courage to answer the call and say yes, I mean, let's explore\n",
      " I don't know how yet, but I'm just saying yes to finding out. Hmm, and that's all I need to do to get started.\n",
      " I feel like this I feel this is a perfect opportunity to introduce sharing from personal experience just to kind of give some color to what we're talking about. So I'm going to use an example of a dream that I have been manifesting into reality now to the point where it is in reality and the experiences quickly approaching the physical 3D experience is quickly approaching. So at the very beginning we talked about how it's like the first thing you do is you pay attention to something that catches your attention something feels.\n",
      " Length and for me the the dream that I'm in the process of manifesting to reality is hosting Retreats and beautiful places with beautiful people and this this wasn't something that I've been present to wanting to do for my whole life rather. This was something that I became aware of through exactly this I was I was in and experience in a situation similar.\n",
      " Similar to a retreat and I felt a feeling and I can I can actually I can pop back into the moment. It was it's so vivid and so clear for me. I remember thinking this this feeling feels like exactly how I want to feel like I was like, oh man, this this is for me this feeling is for me and I was like, what is this feeling and it was it was so clear to his like this is this feeling of\n",
      " Being in a position of leadership on a retreat and creating an experience and leading people through this experience. Now that that was just like the little seed that was planted as like, oh, my heart is really in tune with what's happening right now. And this is what it feels like at that moment. I didn't I didn't have any supporting evidence to say. Oh, this is something that I can do. I didn't have any plans and he active plans to do it. I had never seriously\n",
      " he considered the possibility prior of of this idea of becoming a host of retreats.\n",
      " And it was wasn't even something that I had any ideas immediately of how to do of how to like. Oh if this is something I wanted to pursue the rest of the steps to get from that that moment where I was like man this feels really really good to the point where I can call myself as a career Retreat host. All of those steps were completely not in my vision whatsoever. I couldn't see any of them.\n",
      " So it's like that that first little invitation first little moment that first little feeling that I paid attention to\n",
      " And then it was okay. Do I believe you know talking about step to our belief is our belief do we have the level of belief to support us? Like is this something that I believed that I could do do I believe that I could host Retreats? And so that was like the first moment where I really looked at and I was like, okay. Is this something that is within my realm of possibility?\n",
      " And of course when we say that we have to realize that we create intentionally our own Realms of possibility. It's quite literally just a matter of how willing we are to stretch what feels normal natural and usual to us how how far were willing to go beyond our wheelhouse or realm of comfort our comfort zone to make something possible for us. That's that's really the question. So I think when we're\n",
      " Going to step two which is this, you know looking at our level of belief. It's am I willing to in some cases stick my neck out and say yes, I believe this is possible for me.\n",
      " Hmm. Yeah, so I feel it's that stage is just really the basic belief of what if it was possible. What if it could be possible Right. What if it could be yet? Yes could if I could not hey do I know for sure I can make it happen and I know how right listen go to the how let's just be like, hey, listen, would I want that? Yes. Would that feel amazing?\n",
      " Oh my gosh. Yes. Yeah. Well, they like that to happen. Hell. Yeah, right. Yeah. Do I have believed in me that it could be possible? What if it could be possible even if maybe they're the level of belief is not a strong yet. He said of asking is it possible sure, but what if it could be possible and then you get a strong? Yes. So if you look at that level is just really weighing.\n",
      " The the strength of belief against the doubts that coming up. Mmm-hmm. And if the strength of belief it's bigger that it can dismiss or overcome or may be quiet those doubts then it's definitely something that we can run with we don't need to know how because our brain naturally start thinking about how and then we'll be going to the how is often what?\n",
      " Diminishes or even kills that train right? Because then we get scared in the hole, but I don't know how and somehow we take it as evidence of record and it's not possible, which is not true. Yeah, it's I think what we need to focus on is just okay. Can I believe that can I hold this belief and can it be stronger than the doubts? That might be coming up. Yes, and on some level it is just kind of our innate level of belief.\n",
      " But I feel like our neat level belief is also related to our comfort zone and what we are normally in our natural pattern of behavior accustomed to you know, seeing as a possibility.\n",
      " So when you when you say there's a certain level of belief of what's possible for us. Some of that can be related to what we feel is is in our realm of possibility almost like innately like it's comfortable for me to believe that this is possible and then there's other things that represent a bit of a stretch and when we hear the call, like you said like the our heart really resonates with something sometimes the in\n",
      " Tation is going to be for us to look at something beyond what we're normally accustomed to saying. Oh, yeah, that that feels like something I could do. It might have be the point where like, huh? I've never really considered that before and it feels really really big but just because it feels big doesn't mean it can't be maybe the bigger and more more impertinent question is\n",
      " is is this really something that I want if I could experience this what I want to\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Yeah. Yeah, so I know when you were saying that I felt those two things scary and exciting. It's okay that it's scary as long as it's exciting.\n",
      " Beautifully static. I think sometimes we expect things to all if it's a user in should be easy or I should have no mixed feelings may be all there should be no fear. I don't think that's the case.\n",
      " Okay. So yeah, the maybe wow this is so Grand. This is so out of my comfort zone. This is so out of my kind of experience right? I have never done anything like that. Oh, can I do it? I don't know. I don't have evidence yet. Right so it's scary. It's uncomfortable. But oh my gosh, it also is so exciting because what if I could because my heart says he'll yes. Let's do\n",
      " Let's try it. I don't know if I can or cannot but I want to find out.\n",
      " Yes, and I feel like at that point. I love you said there that's fantastic. It's about the excitement of it. Yes. I feel like there's a moment where it's\n",
      " It's no longer. Is this possible but rather how can this be possible? Not not in I need to know all of the how right now because that's honestly that's never how this happens, you know you when you're at this stage of dream seating, you never have all the details right up front. It's going to be an unfolding always it's going to be an unfolding and ever-increasing expanding illumination of clarity, but at that moment where it's like\n",
      " Came a heart strongly says yes, if I could experience this I would want to and there's like a decision point where you say. Okay, it's not can I do this? But rather, how can I do this and by asking that's just seeding a possibility into our imagination precisely because when you write the ask the right questions that we can hear the answers.\n",
      " Right beautiful. Absolutely. And I think that's literally what it becomes at that moment. It's like, okay, how can this be possible and again rather than trying to see the whole Road right off the bat. You just say, okay. Well, what would be some questions that I would start to ask if I were to assume that this is possible for me and I think that might be one of the key words here today is you begin to assume that. Yeah, it can be done. Yes. It is possible.\n",
      " Yes, it is something that I want to have that I want to experience. So then you start asking questions along those lines. Okay. So for me it was okay. I want to host Retreats. Okay. What if I could host Retreats? Okay, how can I host Retreats? And so then I the questions that I started to ask myself weren't is this possible and they weren't that anymore because I decided yes it was they became.\n",
      " Came, okay, assuming that I'm now hosting Retreats. Who would I host Retreats for like where where what types of places would I want to host retreats in like it becomes a thinking from the possibility rather than thinking of the possibility. Hmm. So to dwelling in a pool of possibilities. Yes. Yeah. I feel like that.\n",
      " It says so you already started describing. What I feel is our step three, which is Clarity. Mmm and and gaining Clarity and the unfolding on the process coming into fruition kind of like building a puzzle. You have to start piece by piece. Yes before you have the full image, right or like getting dressed, you know, if you go to an event.\n",
      " Depends on what kind of event it is. You may pick a different self presentation, right? If you're going to a Gala you most likely choose to wear something different than if you go into a bonfire on the beach, right? So that's the first step. Okay. Well, I'm going to a Gala. Okay, I want to feel fancy. Okay. Well, I wanna wear evening dress, right? So that's step one of clarity and then you start building up all the add-ons right accessories in a case of dress, right? Okay. What truth?\n",
      " I got nowhere. How am I going to do my hair? What kind of jewelry am I gonna wear? Right, what about makeup? So I feel like we now talking about Clarity of building on our vision starting with one piece and then adding on and building around that yes. Yes, and it really plays into fruition through the questions that we start to ask, you know, so it's again standing in the possibility and asking questions.\n",
      " Ins from the possibility those questions lead to ever-expanding clarity.\n",
      " So I love the analogy gave about building the puzzle and and let's say for a minute that maybe maybe we don't have the box. You know how the box has the image of the final? Maybe we don't have that, you know, maybe we just have this big, you know scattering of a thousand pieces and it's up to us to start to put put them together. We may know, you know, someone may hand us this this, you know this bag full of pieces and they're like, hey, I'm not going to show you the final.\n",
      " Final image but I will tell you that it's a picture of a car. Okay, so you're like, okay. Well, I guess could be a car. You don't know what type of car you don't know where the car is parked. You don't know like you don't I could go all the way down the list of all the things you don't know but that's not the point. The point is to start with what you what you do know and then the questions that you can ask, I like that I like that a lot because I feel like off and it's easy to get distracted or disheartened because of the on\n",
      " No, no being a clouds. It's a law. This is overwhelming or I haven't done it in the past. Like how do I do this? Right? Yeah. So if you said asking the right questions and keep choosing the possibility keep dwelling in the possibility of it. Yes. I love it. Hmm. Yeah, so I think that's a Natural Bridge there to the next step which is where as\n",
      " You know, you said keep choosing the possibility. Yes. So the thing is is as you start to step into this as it begins to leave the realm of just your dreams and slowly begins to take on the tones of reality. There are some things that will start to come up that could be interpreted in a way that could dissuade you or could provoke some fear or some not\n",
      " Enoughness or some you know, kind of kind of dissonance where you're like, oh now this is this is a little scary. I'm a little I'm a little far out of my comfort zone. I don't I don't really know what I'm doing or I feel overwhelmed. There's there's there's your limiting beliefs that can start to come up and I think you made the key point there as that stuff starts to come up. It's incredibly important to continue to stand.\n",
      " in the possibility\n",
      " Meaning. Okay. Yes. I acknowledge that. This is out of my comfort zone. Okay. So for me, I'm hosting my first retreat at the end of October. I've never hosted. I've been on Plenty of Retreats, but I've never hosted a retreat before it is out of my comfort zone. So I do I am having experiences from time to time. We're some of my limiting beliefs will come up and say man. This is this quite a bit of a stretch\n",
      " but the key thing is is rather than interpreting those voices to me. No, this isn't for me or oh I shouldn't do this or oh, you know, I should let my fear change my response in some way. I'm choosing to continue to stand in the possibility and view those things that are coming up as invitations to expand my clarity even further and I love it. So when those doubts or maybe critical voices or\n",
      " fear or limiting beliefs or resistance or overwhelm or any of this sort doubt comes up instead of latching onto it and running with it you choose to notice that\n",
      " pay attention to it, but also not to run with it. So I wearing this versus attention, right? You become aware of how interesting not enough Ness is coming up right or fear is coming up and then you switch to a tension of okay. However, this is happening. I am not allowing my attention to run with it.\n",
      " I just stay in the possibility. Yes. And so you choose to see it as a gift that seats further clarity.\n",
      " Rather than takes you away from what possible?\n",
      " Yes. Yes, very very well said and to really make that practical just just as an example, you know it one point I you know in the process of planning all of this and you know, it's been an unfolding as we talked about with the clarity skit and clearer and clearer and clearer to where it's like, okay now I have the people that I'm inviting to The Retreat now, I have the location of where I'm doing the retreat now. I'm doing now I'm literally crafting the\n",
      " Of the retreat and about I mean there's there's some stuff that came up along the way don't get me wrong. But really there was a certain point where it was like man, this is starting to feel like over. Well, like how how do I how do I do all that is required of me to do to create this experience that I'm so clear that I want to have and that overwhelm.\n",
      " Standing in my possibility firmly viewing that overwhelmed. I interpreted that feeling of overwhelm as an invitation to ask for help. Hmm. And so that's when I reached out to a couple of people couple trusted people and I said, hey, will you come with me? Will you come help me lead a retreat? Can I hand over, you know these events that are planned on this day. Will you take the lead on this? Will you handle the planning of this excursion?\n",
      " You you know do this will you do this? Well, this other person do this part and it's like if I hadn't if I hadn't honored that feeling of overall if I had chosen just to ignore it. Maybe I wouldn't have seen as clearly as I did when I sat with it while still standing in my possibility. Maybe I wouldn't have seen quite as clearly that that's what it was. It was a hey you have the opportunity to ask for help and people will Ally with you in this and\n",
      " then you can step through the overwhelm into something more expansive. We're now all of these details are being taken care of and you're even Freer to continue to dream even bigger.\n",
      " I love it. So you reframe it? And he said of seeing is an obstacle right or a roadblock you so it has invitation or the market or a pointer on on your map, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like I gave the that's sitting further Clarity. I love it. It's amazing. Mmm-hmm. There's so much.\n",
      " Honestly, when we talk about people who powerful who are powerful manifest errs who are able to bring really expansive big beautiful dreams into reality. I'm I'm reminded of of a\n",
      " I'm reminded of paper that I wrote for school a number of years back about the founders of Airbnb two friends, and I'm reminded of this moment where they got to the point where they were they had their dream really clearly like hey, this is going to be Airbnb. It's going to be this thing. It's going to enable, you know people to connect with each other to provide housing experiences for people that are traveling unlike anything that's available out there in the world right now.\n",
      " And there's this key moment where they sent emails to a couple of people that they thought would make great investors and they pitch their product and they said this is what we have. This is our Dream. This is what we believe it can be.\n",
      " And they got back knows they got back. No after no after no and I'm just using this Airbnb stories one example, you ask anybody who's built something truly worth building and they'll tell you the same thing. There's always a moment where where they get a know. There's always a moment where they get a no and that is the moment because in that moment that is either where you powerfully stand in your possibility.\n",
      " And you reframe that no into either a not yet or a not this way, but it's still happening or you allow that no to crush your dream. I love how you put it.\n",
      " Yes, very powerful.\n",
      " And you're you're standing that moment. It's going to be one or the other you have to make that choice and Time After Time After Time After again, the people who are successful in bringing their massive dreams into reality are the ones who no matter how many nodes they get they reframe it and they say, okay then I'm going to find something better. Okay, not you. I'm going to find another investor and he's going to give me more money. Oh\n",
      " Not him. All right. I'm going to fight another veteran. He's going to give me better terms. Oh, not him. I'm going to take it to these people. It's just they refuse to take no as if I don't answer because there's so firmly rooted in their possibility. No one can tell them. No. Hmm. So instead of quitting they just find a different way.\n",
      " So I really think that it comes through how they frame the experience of being told. No because they can either take that no and interpret it somehow that means that the value of their dream or what they what you know, somehow they're they're misappropriating the value like somehow it's not as good as they thought it was or it's not the opportunity thought it was like they somehow make it mean that they're not good enough for their dream isn't good enough.\n",
      " Or they frame it into a okay. Something better is coming.\n",
      " And it again it we've talked before about the power of our meaning making our ability to interpret events in our life is having meaning for us. And that's really where our creative power is and there's there's a moment where we make that decision that no matter what anyone tells us. We're going to continue to stand rooted in that possibility continue to look for. How can this be possible regardless of what's coming back to us that?\n",
      " might suggest the contrary\n",
      " that's a very powerful place to be in.\n",
      " I would say it's the most powerful place to be unstoppable onslaught gessle.\n",
      " Yes, yes.\n",
      " Absolutely the and I say that it's like you literally cannot fail when you powerfully and body are possibility to that degree. You literally cannot fail.\n",
      " Sounds good.\n",
      " Yes, okay. So let's let's make that a little bit more practical its dock it down. Okay. So yes, we understand that people who bring big things into reality don't don't allow other people to tell them no and that chances are at some point. We will have an experience where it looks like maybe it's not possible and that is our invitation to even more firmly embody our possibility.\n",
      " And some of the ways that that can come up with is going to be. Okay. Yes, when example people telling us know. Yep. Another would be ourselves telling ourselves know so that would be in the form of limiting beliefs or doubts about our abilities our gifts skills talents and abilities. We think somehow we're insufficient. Oh, I don't have the willpower to see this through. I don't have the diligence to see this through. I don't have I don't have I don't have like all of those things can be voices that start to come up and say oh this isn't actually possible.\n",
      " Some common lilac and scarcity is coming up is their lack of resources or time or energy or imagination or strength or courage? Yep, and the important thing to understand is is as we just said the people who are successful are the ones that can continue to embody their possibility. Yes, but it's more than that. It's also understanding that these things are all enormous.\n",
      " Milland natural part of the process. I think it's so colorful normalizing this experience rather than getting freaked out. Oh my gosh that's coming up. Therefore. It's assigned of whatever it's not possible. I shouldn't do it. I'm gonna fail right right the other being local interesting. Thank you. This is either protecting me or guiding me and you know what? It's no more. It's perfectly was to be expected.\n",
      " In fact, I think when we normalize it and we expect it coming it. Does it throw us off as much it still doesn't feel good. Right? Yes, but if we expected it's not some kind of surprised at just like knocks us down.\n",
      " Well said that is so important. It's so important to build that into the experience with with ease and Grace like hey, yeah.\n",
      " Yes, honor it honor the struggle. Yes. Yeah and and and love ourselves through it.\n",
      " You know it pregnancies right like giving giving birth while let's use it as a human example pregnancies aren't always easy. They can be very painful. They can be very distressing. They can have a lot of complications but it's about it's about loving yourself through it understanding that what's coming, you know, giving giving birth to that baby or giving birth to this idea this dream, you know made manifest like that.\n",
      " Is worth it and under seeing this is a journey towards that it's all part of the process and continuing to love ourselves through it and to you know, it sounds cliche but there's so much truth through its enjoying the journey even when it's rough or even especially when it's rough. Hmm. And what the laws is to do it is having the strong belief that that is what I would heart desires and also,\n",
      " Keeping the desired destination very strongly in mind in heart in division, right? Yeah.\n",
      " Yeah, I know I talked about how once once I got clear on my Retreats as like okay, hosting Retreats and posting them for my students and I'm hosting them in Barbados, you know, once once I got to that level of clarity and then I went and I found the villa in Barbados where this will be happening. I started to consciously fall asleep in Barbados every night what I mean by that is you know, I as as I would go to sleep.\n",
      " So powerful and so beautiful as I would fall asleep each night, you know, my eyes are closed and laying in bed. I would move my Consciousness to that moment where I'm in Barbados and the house is full. There's all these beautiful people and I'm laying in my bed and I'm feeling so much gratitude for the experience of the day knowing that I've literally lived my dream. You know, I've had all these beautiful moments. He's beautiful experiences. They've eaten amazing food it\n",
      " I'm just so grateful and I would even even now, you know months away from the actual event. I'll fall asleep in that state of a feeling. It's truth and feeling it's reality and I think that you know, when you talk about remaining grounded in the possibility of being grounded in the dream, you know, that's that's one of the key tools is to take that time. I just happened to do it before bed, but you can integrate in other parts of your day to take that.\n",
      " I'm to put yourself there and to see the final product to feel yourself in the final product of what you're building and to Relish in it to help you stay grounded in that so that as things come up to the contrary, you know invitations for clarity as we're calling these potentially negative experiences as these things start to come up we have that that reference experience that that's helping us. Stay clear. It's helping us stay grounded. It's helping us stay confident and\n",
      " hopeful about our ability to actually make it real.\n",
      " Yes. Yes. It's very necessary very needed right to stand strong and tall in our vision in our being rooted in our bill. Yeah.\n",
      " Yes, and and not just to see it once but to see it all the time to keep being, you know, believe right to keep the faith a lot.\n",
      " Yes, imagining constantly feeding it. Yes, and to to building this Courage the strength and the courage to stay in coherence of the vision that we have the desire. So I feel like that's one thing as our Insight inner work and then you mention also asking other people for help or collaboration.\n",
      " Right, and it's another piece of that.\n",
      " Yes, you want to tell us how to go about that?\n",
      " Yeah, so I there are some of the things that can come up can be invitations to have a conversation. So for instance for me. Usually whenever I become present to the feeling of overwhelm, this is planning a retreat overseas with all these people flying in from all over the world. There's a lot of moving pieces that go into it and I found myself at various points feeling present to this feeling of overwhelm.\n",
      " And rather than being like Oh, I'm doing too much. This is too much. This is you know too big or really making it mean anything negative. I've purposefully intentionally viewed it framed it as an invitation to have a conversation with someone to help get my thoughts out to use the mirror of that other person to gain more clarity about, you know, next steps to take what's what's most important.\n",
      " You know, but it's also important particularly at the beginning stages, you know, Violetta you and I had talked about how a lot of times when you very first become pregnant. You don't tell the whole world, you know, you usually just tell particularly the earliest stages most people wait until the second trimester to share the news more widely, but the various earliest moments like, okay. Yep. You tell your partner. Maybe you tell a parent maybe tell us\n",
      " Sister or best friend, you know are from a male side. Maybe you're telling a brother and a best friend something like that. Right? But like your kind of careful who you share the news with right away. They're very protective of it because it's very tender and very precious right precious than tender. Mmm. And so you are not treated like it's precious and you want to be tender without you want to be protective of it till you get stronger so it can work.\n",
      " Well out of lack of better word defend itself on its own because it's already strong and powerful and manifested and actually happening and can no longer be pooped on as you know how to manifest things into reality through our nation's and she says at first don't share it with anyone because a lot of\n",
      " People have this tendency of poor to poop on your your your vision and have this neither telling you of how that is not possible.\n",
      " Hmm. Yes. Oh how you could fail. Yeah, right. Right, right or it provokes some memory within them of a time when they tried to dream big and failed or stories that they've heard or some sort of fear within them. So it's important to choose the people that you share your dream with wisely and you know the way I see it is I share my dream with other people who are also\n",
      " So intentional creators who understand the process this isn't new to them, you know, they're not they're not one to look at a dream and say oh, yeah, that's unlikely there one to look at a dream and say that's a really cool idea. Yeah, how can I how can I help you? Get more clarity so that this can become even more real for me.\n",
      "\n",
      " It's like it's like they become allies or they become enrolled in your dream in some way. Yeah, they become so creator of your dream and it's either by brainstorming or simply supporting your vision believing in your vision, right? Yeah. That's that's a key role and I feel like at this point we have to say to those of you who are listening to this right now. We have to say that when someone else approaches you with their dream\n",
      " Make sure you hold it the same way. You would want them to hold your dream. If you were sharing from a place of tenderness is precious. I like that's just thing to use the example since we've been talking about intentional conception and becoming pregnant and then carrying to pregnancy and then actually giving a birth to a baby. It's the same with an idea right? Let's say you did carry the pregnancy and you actually gave a birth to a baby in our case and I\n",
      " Yeah, if you had a newborn baby, you wouldn't just let anyone hold it. You wouldn't just let a stranger babysit it right. You'll be very selective of who you let this baby to be in the presence of.\n",
      " Yes, and it's the same with the dream.\n",
      " Something is precious and tender for you that you building right at you creating your creation.\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      " Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And and you know, yeah finding people who hold that level of space for you and then also being that trusted person that other people can trust with their babies as well. Yeah. Yeah asking really good questions is what comes to mind but from from the place of standing in the possibility with not from the place of like well what makes you think you can do that rather being like Oh, that's what you want to do. Cool. All right.\n",
      " Well, what would it feel like if you are on Retreat, you know and you had people that have flown in from all over the world for the experience that you were creating. What would that feel like, can you put words to it? Can you describe it? Can you begin to paint it? Can you paint it for me under understanding that you're you're giving them the gift of exploring their way into further Clarity by by being that sounding board for them and I think like also by talking about whatever heart.\n",
      " Fires, not only we gain more clarity, but we found the fire in our heart because again, we keep dwelling in a possibility right in excitement of it coming true shaping up becoming real moving from the realm of imagination to physical reality.\n",
      " Then we can talk like in your case, you know started with oh, wow. How amazing would it be to host the retreat getting to the point that oh my gosh. He's an email here is a booking confirmation for a place I secured here is a deposit on putting down right? I have the day that have the location. I have people who pre-registered.\n",
      " Hmm, right? Okay. So I feel like we are ready to move to the next tab or of when the dream actually does come true and it starts being visible. You can touch it. You can see it you have proof and evidence of it being in 3D reality. So it moved from being a self diffusion in our imagination and it's hardening in.\n",
      " The fox it's becoming complete right?\n",
      " Yes, yes. Well said yeah and it is a gradual hardening is though it's you know, like when you're when you're pouring plastic or you're pouring glass or something like that like a slowly hardens as it cools that really is the process of what had happened. So it's like yes all the details start to fill in to place it becomes more and more real and then it's real and then you step into it and you can touch taste smell see talk to hug.\n",
      " Act with it. It's in the 3D physical reality and it's quite literally a dream come true beautiful dream come true. Oh here it is. And you look at it and you feel excited and proud and content and fulfilled and you think wow look at that. I created that here it is.\n",
      " And you know the best part the best part is that when it's a 3D reality fact, it's even better. If even better. It's even better than the imagination. You know, I could I could I have a pretty vivid imagination. I Can Dream to some pretty beautiful experiences and it never ceases to amaze me how when they actually show up and I'm actually\n",
      " We end the moment and I'm actually living that it's so much better so much brighter so much sweeter than even my imagination could have could have guessed. It's I think that's part of the magic of being a conscious Creator in this form and this you know, and in this world as it were is there's there's a magic to when we become intentional with our creations and things begin to harden to fact there's there's an X Factor that makes\n",
      " Makes them even better than what we originally imagined indeed. It's a very sweet magical moment because we know where we started right and to be able to see the journey and to get to this point is quite an amazing feeling. Okay, so we got our Dream Come True.\n",
      " With your complete. It came even more beautiful than we expected.\n",
      " Okay, and then want you go to Barbados? Yes. So you go to Barbados. You have your retreat on the last night of the retreat you fall asleep in Barbados and the next morning you wake up and the retreat is over and it's the morning after and then what what happens in that stage and yeah.\n",
      " Well, there's there's a couple of things that I think are really important for that moment for the moment of the morning after after having had this this experience and then it's over it least like the super acute version of is over. Okay. So in my in my case, I'm talking about a week-long experience. Yes. It's going to add you know, but it's like okay, there's a couple things to be aware of and y1 is the recognition of of what just happened.\n",
      " And and it's again to use my example. It's not just oh, hey, I hosted a retreat in Barbados. Yeah, that's part of it. But it's more than that. It's recognizing the fullness of the journey. The process represented the whole process whole. Yeah, looking back to the moment when I first had that in cling of an idea of like, okay Inception of the idea, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      " Like the very first yes looking back to that that that Inception point of oh this really became a you know, first inkling of a possibility all the way up to the point where now I've had the experience and I'm sitting in the morning after so I think recognition of all of that is very important. I think it's important to honor the gravity of what we've done.\n",
      " And what I mean by that is is we are content we are creators and the idea is that we are becoming ever more conscious of our process of creation and ever more intentional with what we choose to create. So I think it's important to honor the gravity of you know, hey, I took something from just a fleeting imaginary thought and I brought it into 3D physical material reality and understanding that that is\n",
      " What we're here to do in to experience in this form and to honor everything that went into them. Yes, I love it. So recognizing what has happened how it started how it unfolded what the steps where right maybe what the hang ups were or the dangerous turns how we navigated them. Right? What worked what didn't work may be reflecting on what we would do differently.\n",
      " Next time right? So the recognition the reflection and then the learnings that come from the having that experience.\n",
      " Right who we have become because of this experience right how it shifted our identifications our beliefs our wheelhouse of what we think is possible and I think that leads us to the fourth element of celebrating because that's all so we're celebrating.\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      " It absolutely is worth celebrating. And yeah, I was just going to say all that what that sounds like to me as a journal exercise that that sounds like as conscious creators. It sounds like it's important to sit down with the piece of paper after the completion of bringing something big into reality having and you know combination type experience. I think it's important to sit down and get out out of our heads onto paper in some way.\n",
      " Our experience of it what we're present to around it honoring the journey looking back at all. Those things you said about, you know, the the points at which it was rough points which you know, it required additional staying power, you know, and then you said the learning I think that's critically important to is I think we do learn not not just you know, logistical things about like my instance how to host a retreat. I mean, yeah, I'll learn about that too. But I think we also learn\n",
      " More about how to be a conscious intentional Creator through the process of actually doing it. Yeah, I think we learn more about like you said, no just Logistics not how to choose but even more so Who We Are\n",
      " Yeah, how how we complete things how you respond to things when they come because those are the higher level skills. We can use in any concept any Endeavor any project. Right? Like I said, maybe building a retreat is the first time doing it. And yes, when you learn about researching venues and securing the news and contracts. If you do Retreat again, you can then just reuse it, right?\n",
      " But in any other process you may again start another process again first time but in the process of doing the retreat's you have learned about yourself things that you will apply you have learned about the process itself that you will apply right in a different setting and I think what it needs us to is that what this experience does. It really builds confidence.\n",
      " Because we have this experience we succeeded right and maybe even let's say that the vision wasn't as Grand as you imagine. There is still so much to be celebrated right to saying yes to what we wanted to be tenacious in it to taking it to a completion, right? But all built our self-esteem our level of believing in ourselves.\n",
      " I would confidence because now we have an experience. We have learned so much, right and we have evidence.\n",
      " That we can touch and smell and feel like you said the evidence of wow, I can do hard things and I don't need to know how to I just have to say yes to it and it will unfold if I stick with it it will come to fruition. Yes.\n",
      " And what I think that leads us to then is when we have this confidence and we choose to focus on this evidence to support the experiences we have then we have this new level of excitement that makes us dream even bigger next time.\n",
      " Yes, makes us say yes to things again that may seem scary or big at first, right? Yes. It gives us this feeling of Daring.\n",
      " Yes of baldness. Wow. Yes of Courage.\n",
      " Which is very powerful that empowering.\n",
      " Wow, and I feel like the pool of possibilities becomes bigger. Maybe now it's not a poor maybe now. It's a huge Lake.\n",
      " Yes. Yeah, absolutely. And you think ooh, I you know didn't know how this is gonna happen and I did it. Wow. What else can I do? What's next?\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      " Hmm, so beautifully said that feels so good. It's your dad doesn't it makes the heart Happy.\n",
      " Yes. Mmm.\n",
      " Okay. Well that that's quite the that's quite the map for you know, this this topic of when dreams come true. Hmm. Okay, any closing thoughts invitations and good grades?\n",
      " Just just encouragement, wherever you are, whoever, you know, you're listening to this and you're thinking about your dream. Whatever it is that you're in the process of standing in the possibility of just continue to do it and understand that you do have the ability to be unstoppable you truly do and it's all about how you respond to what comes up. So just just an encouragement to\n",
      " frame anything that comes up as an opportunity to expand and Clarity and understand that you are unstoppable when you do so\n",
      " hmm. I agree my closing thoughts and it's an invitation. So we all keep choosing our Dream regardless regardless of obstacles that may be coming up regardless of lack of evidence in the past regardless of may be limiting beliefs or lack of support on the outside to keep to\n",
      " ink the dream\n",
      " that we want to manifest.\n",
      " Because they always do if we listen to them and if we stick with them they always do it's the most magical amazing thing and it's not logical at all. In fact, it gives me Goose Bumps now. We're just thinking about it of so many examples in my life when that has happened.\n",
      " Yes, such a powerful place to be in to be a powerful money faster and to intentionally create.\n",
      "\n",
      " I'll be complete.\n",
      " I am complete. Well their fall well in that case, thank you. I love you. Stay tuned and come back from\n",
      " Okay. We'll talk to you next time till next time. Bye.\n",
