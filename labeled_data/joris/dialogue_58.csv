3	Hi, everyone, Ronnie here.	
2	You're listening to clean with me the podcast about cleaning to listen to while you clean.	
1	I hope everyone's having a great day today. It's time to gear up for our big cleaning session. And if you're new to the show The Way We gear up for that is to make sure that we look presentable. Whatever that means for you freshen up a little bit. Sometimes we light a candle or turn on a wax warmer or sometimes. It's a matter of just opening a door or a window turning on some. And sliding some fresh air come through if it's a nice day. I know right now. I've got the air conditioner and the fan on so I'm not airing out my house, but I have my wax warmer plugged in.	
2	I'm not cleaning while I record or anything, but just to give you an idea kind of what I like to do during the day to get comfortable and especially when I'm cleaning.	
1	I like to make sure that I'm comfortable and a lot of times that means being cool enough.	
2	Cough.	
1	So even in the winter, I will go down to just like a cami which is if I don't know people in other countries listening I've realized that there are some new stats available to me. So I realized that only 79 percent of you are in the United States. So some of the terminology with our English could be a little bit different when I just throw out these random terms like I'm wearing a cami but it's a tank top a little spaghetti straps and it's something that I use. As an undershirt when I was out grocery shopping earlier. I had a t-shirt over it like if I'm wearing kind of a low-cut top. I like to wear a cami under it to kind of give me a little bit more coverage in the front but around the house once I start cleaning, I definitely go down to the Kami because I tend to get hot and I guess I'm just not like everybody else. I remember shopping with my mom recently. And she doesn't live near me but when I was in town visiting and she was saying something about well, it's not really the time of year to be buying short sleeve shirts or something. So for me, it's always the time for sure sleeve shirts. I do wear sweaters and jackets and coats when I go out, but I don't	
2	really like wearing long sleeves	
1	a lot of times when I'm shopping. I will take my sweater off tie it around my waist or put it in the shopping cart.	
2	And go down to just a t-shirt with short sleeves and I don't care if it's the dead of winter I get hot.	
1	So I like to dress in layers. So some of you ladies might be able to relate to that but some of you might be just you know this time of year, you have all of your short sleeve shirts packed away and you switch to long sleeve shirts. I do own a few long sleeve shirts, but it's usually good to wear a cami underneath in case I have to take it.	
2	Off because even if I were one by myself by itself, I get really hot.	
1	So just some random thoughts on how I get comfortable to clean, but the less clothing that I have on the better. Basically, let's see taking out the kitchen trash. That's something that I often do to make sure that my house is smelling good we take out the trash every day. We don't live in an area where they have the same. Separate recycle bins.	
2	Okay. I know some of you are gasping right now, but you know in California, we've lived somewhere where you keep those things separate here. There's just one receptacle and everything goes into that and somebody else goes through that stuff later or whatever. So anyway, that's just what we do here.	
1	Anyway with a family of six we do. Tend to fill up the kitchen trash every day.	
2	And sometimes I empty the bathroom waste baskets into it. So that usually needs to be emptied right away.	
1	And one of the reasons I do that at the beginning of a cleaning session, I take the trash out realign it that way.	
2	I have somewhere to throw the trash as I'm cleaning the kitchen because you do come across a lot of trash when you're cleaning a messy kitchen and this is a messy Monday folks. So So what that means for me? Is that on the weekend? I'm usually spending a lot of quality time with the family Saturday.	
1	We were fishing Sunday.	
2	We had Church. My husband was home spent a lot of time with him. So Mondays are day to recover and I kind of lost a lot of time today just due to an incident that happened when I locked my keys in Car even though I have keyless entry. There's a low battery and I locked them in. So anyway couldn't get the car open and I had to use my roadside assistance.	
1	But when you're a busy mom and you lose an hour and a half of your time, it can kind of mess up your day. Anyway, I'm trying to remain positive though.	
2	So, you know, make sure your house smells good make sure you look good and let's get started probably in the kitchen unless you need to straighten up the front entrance of your home real quick. I'm not talking about deeply cleaning the living areas. We'll get to that later in the show, but maybe you need to just kind of pick up. So that the front of your house looks presentable if someone were to stop by or come home early and let's get started in the kitchen.	
1	Usually when you go into a kitchen you're either going to be removing clutter off of the counter tops or putting away clean dishes. So you might need to throw away some trash. You might need to put away some food.	
2	You know, maybe there's a box of cereal out or a container of some sort of sauce that people tend to leave out maybe some seasonings that need to be put away.	
1	Maybe just things that don't belong in the kitchen at all paper clutter.	
2	What have you, you know male should have a basket that it goes in things like that.	
1	So if you have clutter get that dealt with so that you can kind of isolate the mess down to just dishes if you have dishes to do You're going to want to put away clean dishes. Maybe you have a drying rack that you need to empty, or maybe you need to empty your dishwasher. And put those things away and if you don't have any dishes to do, you know while I'm talking about dishes just get right into the deep cleaning of your kitchen because some days if you've been, you know cleaning as you go doing dishes after meals, you might not have a messy kitchen. So if that's you this would be a great day to just deep clean your surfaces like, you know, maybe even the inside of your microwave the inside of your fridge.	
2	You know wipe down your countertops all your appliances and give your floor a good sweep and thorough mopping maybe even on your hands and knees but for a lot of us, we've got to tackle some dishes first.	
1	So we put away the clean dishes and then it's time to either load the dishwasher or start a sink and when I talk about starting a sink load of dishes, I'm assuming that you fill up the sink with hot. Soapy water, but I realize that some people don't do that. I was watching a little video on Pinterest earlier because I try to to read a lot of cleaning articles and cleaning videos and things to kind of get ideas for the show and make sure that I'm covering everything and that, you know, I'm staying with the trends and it was a video of hacks where they showed like a little holder for your sponge and just some different things to make doing dishes easier. But what I noticed is that they were washing the each dish just in one step.	
2	They would squirt a little bit of dish soap on it scrub it with a sponge and then rinse it under running water and put it in the drying rack.	
1	Whereas I do dishes a different way and it doesn't matter how you do them.	
2	But just to kind of give you some ideas of your options. We'll talk about some of the different ways. But the way I do it is I when I'm hand-washing of course and you guys know that I have a dishwasher so I load the dishwasher first and then a lot of times I handwash what's left or just certain items that I want to be very careful with will be hand washed.	
1	So when I'm hand-washing I will take the plate for example, and then I'll grab just kind of a brush and under running water.	
2	Just kind of scrape off that plate. I have a garbage disposal so that can just go right into the sink and I call that kind of a pre-rinse.	
1	Then that will go into the hot soapy dishwater and I'll do that with several different things until I have a sink load so that it's a hot water with like a dawn or Palmolive in it bubbles.	
2	Okay, and then I pre-ripped things and put them in there and I start with things like glasses silverware and then I do plates and bowls.	
1	So, you know those things might all go in together if it's a small amount of dishes, but if it's if it's a large amount then I might have a whole load of just glasses and silverware a whole sink load and I will then use either a dish wand with a sponge on the end of it or a sponge or even a dishrag.	
2	Just whatever. I feel like using at that time and I will wash the dishes and then rinse them under running water as hot as I can stand and then put them in the drying rack and they do they do soak a little bit before I start washing them because I start out with real hot water and then it soaks a little bit while the water is getting a little bit cooler just to where it's you know, it's not too hot. So there's kind of a soaking involved there.	
1	That's kind of how I do it and then if the water starts to get dirty, you know, if I was doing just several loads by hand I would drink. Rain it rinse out the sink and start over.	
2	But typically I'm only doing about one sink load at a time at my house because I have a dishwasher also.	
1	Now it's kind of a bummer.	
2	My dishwasher takes upwards of 2 hours and 45 minutes.	
1	I was really surprised at first the older dishwashers took about an hour newer ones take longer and there's pros and cons. I mean the good thing about the one that took an hour. It was like you'd run it and then you'd load it again.	
2	Like you wouldn't even have to wash if you had a lot of dishes piling up. You wouldn't even have to hand wash. I mean just be like I'll be back in an hour and do another load but when it's taking over two hours almost three hours, you've got to hand wash the rest of the stuff. Otherwise you're going to end up procrastinating is just going to get too late in the day. So just some thoughts. You might want to time how long your dishwasher cycle is.	
1	I'm always saying I'm going to time it but I'm pretty sure it's over 2 hours and 45 minutes, but I don't know if I have it down just did the exact minutes, but it takes It sometime so if you do have an older dishwasher on a positive, you can run it back to back, you know in a shorter amount of time, but the positive as you're probably saving money if you have the newer one because it's using less water and maybe less heat.	
2	Anyway, that's kind of you know, it's energy efficient. So that's the trade-off.	
1	So you do all your dishes and then once you're done you're going to be cleaning your surfaces, I like to remove any food items, like for example, a fruit bowl a loaf of bread things like that. I have this like two-tiered basket and sometimes I'll have fruit on one level and then bread and tortillas and another one of the baskets.	
2	I'll usually just move that thing over. to the table When I'm spraying down, my Island. So I like to relocate things when I spray a cleaning product other times.	
1	I don't want to relocate things. If I don't want to relocate things. I will wipe the counter top with a cleaning wipe or just a damp rag dipped in the soap dish water and then run out, but when I'm doing a little more of a deep clean with the surfaces, I like to remove all food spray them down with a multi surface spray.	
2	And scrub them down and if anything is dried on I'll use like the Rough Side of a sponge and even my thumbnails you hear about people using a plastic scraper. A lot of times. I use my thumb nail. I probably said that before on the show, but I have real nails and I use them.	
1	So anyway, Get those dishes done. I'll give you a little bit of time to do that. And then of course on most days well every day. You want to wipe your stovetop along with the countertops some days you want to remove the burners.	
2	If you have that kind and clean inside those trays or you know, clean your burner Parts, depending on what kind of burners you have. If you have a gas stove you might be soaking your actual burners or even running them through the dishwasher. If you have an electric stove, you might occasionally remove the burners.	
1	Clean that tray underneath kind of my trick if I have not been good about cleaning my burner trays and they've gotten discolored. You can buy new ones and replace them, but kind of my trick sometimes when I'm getting ready for company is I'll take those out and I'll cover them with aluminum foil and then put them back on, you know, you rinse them off first, but that way just that Blackness doesn't show so that's a little lazy shortcut for you if you're going to ready to have Me or something.	
2	There are ways to get them clean but you know like with an oven cleaner and gloves or something, but I I'll typically either cover them in foil or occasionally by the new trays. I'm more likely to cover them in foil.	
1	I have a new range right now.	
2	So they're still really clean and I'm going to try to keep them clean, but I'm sure the day will come when I'm covering them in foil again in preparation for my mom to come visit her something. So, you know once they get discolored so yeah the stovetop though just around the burners you're wiping that every day and then the back control panel area. But on most days you're also going to want to wipe the front of your larger appliances, you know with some kind of a spray and a paper towel or maybe your microfiber cloth whatever you use is it's not important what you use but you'll want to wipe the front of your dishwasher your oven the outside of your refrigerator. Shredder just get rid of those fingerprints and whatnot front of your microwave and then a bonus chore if you have time and this is a day that you would go deeper would be to clean the inside of your microwave a lot of times when I'm hand washing dishes.	
1	I'll pull out that glass turntable thing from the microwave and I'll wash that I think I have put that in the dishwasher that I typically wash it by hand, but I think either way would work. Cleaning inside the refrigerator.	
2	I had one of the kids just take the food out and wipe off the shelves today. So that's something that you could do small appliances. A lot of times I like to give those a good scrub down.	
1	Usually I wipe them down after I use them. But sometimes you're just on a roll wiping things down and you'll wipe down your small appliances to but remember when I talk about bonus chores in the kitchen, those are not for days when you're very overwhelmed. If you have just mountains of dishes, I don't care that there are what does it matter what I think but nobody's going to care if there are some	
2	Prince or smudges on the front of your dishwasher or refrigerator, you know, it's not long as it's not like a blob of food, but just fingerprints and things that's not as pressing as doing the dishes.	
1	So kind of the way my show works is you go deeper when you can if you're overwhelmed you do them bare minimums, which bare minimums in your kitchen would be washing the dishes wiping down the counter tops and stovetop.	
2	Wiping down your kitchen table. If you have one sweeping the floor.	
1	Okay. Those are those are kind of your minimums.	
2	You might even be able to get away without you know with not sweeping if you either don't have kids or if you have a dog that's good at picking up after your kids. We typically need to sweep every day. We just do if you can't relate. I'm sorry, but that's an everyday thing.	
1	So you'll want to do those bare minimums in the kitchen, but some days you only have a few dishes to do.	
2	Or because you've been keeping up, you know, the better your daily habits are the quicker you can get to cleaning your surfaces because we spend so much time putting things where they go, you know as far as putting away dishes or washing dishes or you know, clearing clutter that type of stuff kind of eats into our time and then we don't have as much time to clean the actual surfaces.	
1	So I'm not saying that cleaning surfaces is not important. I'm just helping you. Your time because if today you don't have time to clean your surfaces tomorrow, you probably will.	
2	Especially if you tell yourself, I'm not going to do this to myself again. I'm not going to let the dishes pile up. I'm going to clean I'm going to do dishes after every meal and then tomorrow's going to be a mop day. You know that type of thing. So if you do get all of your dishes done, and you countertops wipe down the table wipe down maybe even the chairs wipe down if you have kids getting them sticky, then you're going to sweep or vacuum your floor in the kitchen, and then mop and mopping is not an everyday thing for me, but you know, it's probably a good thing to do at least once a week, and the frequency is going to depend on your family, you know, maybe you need to do it more or less often than that.	
4	Maybe you just	
1	Swan a spot clean I definitely spot clean my floor as I go if I feel something sticky I try to deal with that right away so that my floor doesn't just constantly need to be mopped.	
2	It's something we do to sanitize it and shine it up but the sweeping and spot cleaning as you go goes a long way in allowing you to not you know and making it to where you don't have to mop every single day.	
1	So I'm going to give you a little bit more time in the kitchen.	
2	So that you can at least get to sweeping your floor.	
1	While you're sweeping your floor or even mopping your floor. I'm going to talk about some possible bonus chores for those who are ahead of the game today organizing your pantry. I like to keep things organized by category like bake baking Goods side dishes, you know, like I would put flour baking soda baking powder.	
2	Sugar I put those things together and then I have another section where I would have a light boxes of macaroni and cheese canned vegetables things like that, you know side dishes and then I have kind of a box a plastic box that I use for open packages, for example, like a bag of rice or bag of beans that's been opened that way if somebody picks it up wrong or something. It would spill into the box instead of just everywhere but kind of my system for that lately.	
1	Is that every time I buy a package, this is a Frugal tip for you. Every time I buy a package of celery there's a the type of celery I get are not the ones that are already like conveniently cut up.	
2	I'm talking just the cheap celery that's still kind of, you know, all together.	
1	There is a really wide rubber band on that. Celery, so I keep that I put it in my junk drawer in the kitchen then if I buy things like beans and rice and bulk once I open that or brown sugar brown sugar.	
2	It's not really in bulk. But you don't use the whole package at once by especially like for beans and rice.	
1	In fact, sometimes the brown sugar I buy houses IP lock on it bag, so it's resealable. But with the beans and rice.	
2	Usually not so I will take one of those free rubber bands that I got off the celery and put that around the rice bag or the bean bag after I use after I use some of it because everybody knows it's cheaper to get you know, big bag of pinto beans or big bag of white rice, but I still keep those in the Box just kind of out of habit. That's where I keep things that have been open just as a general rule. So those are just some ideas.	
1	You might have fancy canisters lined up in a row and they're all labeled.	
2	My pantry is not that perfect. But I do try to keep it neat and organized. So that's an idea of something that you can do in your kitchen already mentioned, you know, cleaning out the refrigerator and cleaning out the refrigerator can mean two different things some days.	
1	You might not have time to wipe down the shelves, but you might want to just remove leftovers.	
2	You know that you haven't eaten and they're no good anymore. You might want to remove those. So that's one way of cleaning out the refrigerator, you know, sometimes we have good intentions and by a lot of produce and don't eat at all. And you know, I have to get rid of that. Some of it can go to our pet bunny some of its got to go to the trash.	
1	So clean out that refrigerator if you have time wiping down walls. Maybe you have a sliding glass door. In your kitchen area like I do I like to clean that inside and out when I'm ahead and my kitchen and I have time to go a little bit deeper just look around and see what needs to be done. Do you have clutter on top of your refrigerator or on top of your cabinets that you need to go through or relocate?	
2	Have you swept out your pantry in a while? Okay.	
1	What about sanitizing your sponge when you're done with the dishes you want to ring out that sponge you might want to just set it in the microwave for two minutes to sanitize it or you might want to make sure that you have a clean rag or a clean sponge or a clean dish towel for next time and set those things out. A lot of times if we have things set out for us in the kitchen.	
2	We're more likely to do dishes and you know, then what then if we have to go looking for a rag or something for example a few years back.	
1	I went through a phase of walking and then it kind of progressed into running and the way I was able to get up early and exercise was to lay out my clothes the night before and it doesn't seem like it would make a difference, but it did I'm	
2	My shoes socks the outfit that I would be wearing I'd make sure there's a you know the right kind of pocket for my phone, you know, so that I could listen to music and keep track of my miles and all that type of stuff.	
1	So I had certain clothing that I would wear and make sure you know, I had my earbuds ready and I would you know sports bra was definitely a requirement. I'd have all that stuff kind of laid out. So then when I'd wake up man, I really don't feel like running.	
2	I'd look over and well, it's not going to be that hard to get dressed because I already know exactly what I'm wearing. You know, I put that on and then wash my face put my hair in a ponytail, you know didn't take much to get ready to just go out and Jog.	
1	Well, sometimes it can be the same with cleaning.	
2	If you have the cleaning products where you need them ahead of time and the supplies the towels or Rags the sponges everything there for the taking a lot of times.	
1	It's easier to get started.	
2	So just a thought I'd maybe preparing for tomorrow so that you can you know, like I was talking about clean as you go more and then maybe you'll have more time to deep clean surfaces, but Good for you pat yourself on the back if you had time to sweep and mop good for you. But if you just got your dishes done that's progress to let's move on to the next area.	
1	Now. I may have mentioned earlier that you want to straighten that front entrance area at the beginning of A Clean cleaning session, but now it's time to go a little bit deeper as far as just cleaning all of your living areas. So in any living room or family room, you're probably going to want to straighten your couch cushions or throw pillows. Maybe you have DVDs video game controllers things of that nature that need to be placed where they go and then you probably are going to want to wipe off your coffee table and end tables you might have other destined to do but the areas where we actually eat and drink it.	
2	At times need to be wiped down more frequently than just areas that maybe need to be dusted weekly.	
1	So you probably want to wipe off those main tables in your living areas. And then of course pick up any clutter there could be clutter on the couches. Maybe there's a forgotten coffee mug on an end table may be there may be there are sweaters on the couch that	
2	Have just tossed there. Maybe there are shoes on the floor that need to be relocated toys things of that nature.	
1	So whatever it is, you'll want to pick up your floors.	
2	You'll want to clear those horizontal surfaces in my living room.	
1	A lot of times. I'll look at the top of my piano and see if there's anything up there.	
2	That doesn't belong for example the other day there was a toy a up there. There are certain things that go up there like a plant framed pictures a key basket, but there's other things that shouldn't you know, glasses there certain things that I allow up there and then certain things that just don't belong up there. So just remove any clutter from your living areas clear off the surfaces and the floors and then of course lastly you're going to want to sweep or vacuum the floors and there. And that's probably going to take the most of your time but it also probably causes the most impact as far as how your house looks having clean floors in your living areas, whether they're vacuumed or swept and mopped can make a huge difference in the appearance of your home. It'll definitely give you that bang for your buck people will be able to tell that you've cleaned, you know vacuuming and dusting is a big thing. So, Most of your time might be on vacuuming or picking up the floors. Most of your time might be spent on that. But since I can talk faster than you can clean. I'll give you some ideas of bonus chores in those areas and perhaps it's a day that you don't need to sweep or vacuum. Maybe your floors already look good some things that you can do are additional dusting. Maybe you need a desk some knickknacks a bookcase a piano. Maybe you have a window to wash - or you know something really occasional like dusting the baseboards. I've talked about this before but an easy way to dust your baseboards is to rubber band a microfiber cloth around the bottom of a broom and then just rub those baseboards or if they have a lot of buildup you might need to use a wipe. Our sponge or something like that and actually, you know you something wet, but if you keep it dusted you can prevent it from getting to grimy other bonus chores in the kitchen living areas.	
1	Look around to see if you have any spider webs might need to knock those down with your broom dusting the blinds.	
2	Sometimes you need to just raise. Your blinds a little bit and wipe out your window sills because you don't want it to be dirty when somebody goes to raise the blinds. You don't want your window sills to get dirty. So make sure that you wipe those a lot of times. I do that. That's another thing. I do with a white you'll find that I'm kind of big on cleaning wipes, but you know any damp cloth would do the way I clean.	
1	My TV is with a damp microfiber cloth just dampened with water.	
2	So So, you know, don't forget to dust your entertainment center and all your electronics and whatnot. Maybe with even with a feather duster. However, you do things. You know, you usually want to try to dust before you vacuum or sweep. But let's face it your house probably isn't so dusty that if you've already swept or vacuumed your floor and then you wipe down the coffee table and end tables. It's not going to make much difference. Sometimes I do those things out of	
1	Order even though I know that the proper way is to work from the top down and like I said most of your time and your living areas should be sweeping or vacuuming the floors. And the reason I say that is because there shouldn't be a lot of clutter and if there is no judgment here, but just a suggestion you might need some Storage Solutions.	
2	Maybe you need a toy box in the corner. Because there are always toy spread out or maybe you need an ottoman that opens up or a coffee table that has a drawer some way to put things away.	
1	Like for us our kids like to watch a YouTube channel on the big screen TV, that's about drawing. So we keep paper in a drawer in the coffee table because they do draw in that room.	
2	So that's just one example of a storage solution.	
1	And I definitely had that in mind when I got that coffee table. So and in the past, I've had Ottomans where you know something that it which is something you rest your feet on and you can open up the lid and store things inside of there.	
2	And I've seen people store, you know have actually like a chest in the corner of a living room. Just depending on what you do in your living room, you know, you might need some place to store things.	
1	But for the most part it should be about cleaning surfaces and I do have a minimalist approach, although right now, I feel like I don't have enough stuff in my living room because when I first decorated my living room when we moved in, Had put a small plant stand below a picture just to kind of balance out a certain wall and I put a plant there, but now I ended up moving that because people kept bumping bumping it and it was just kind of flimsy and then now they have something else set sitting on top of it. I think it's the modem or something like that and they have it moved over by the TV.	
2	That little stand that I was using.	
1	So I feel like I need some kind of a little shelf unit or bookcase below that picture with some books or knickknacks on it.	
2	So that's something that I'm going to be getting when I can afford it.	
1	So I I say a minimalist approach, but I'm not just telling you to have hardly anything in the room.	
2	You need it to look nice and you need and some of your Decor does need to be three-dimensional, you know, it's not all just pictures on the walls, but for the most part that's I decorate pictures on the walls throw pillows, maybe a plant or a framed picture on a Surface but I don't mind having a few knickknacks. And like I said, I need something in that certain space just to kind of fill it and give the room a little bit more Dimension and balance but you know definitely have a minimalist approach though.	
1	If you're having trouble keeping the room clean, you know.	
2	If you have just a bookcase and small children that are just pulling books off the shelf or whatever, maybe move that bookcase to about bedroom. That's what we that's what we did at our old house. We had the bookcase out front and it became kind of a mess now. It's in a bedroom. The kids are older. They're not scattering the books as much but it's still just saves time when straightening the living room that you're not just worried. I'm not just worried about are these books You know lined up correctly or something. They can be a little bit in perfect. If they're just in a child's room as long as the child is happy with how they're organized. You see what I'm saying? So if there's a problem with clutter in your living room, you met our family room. You may want to consider downsizing as far as putting some things somewhere else and just keeping that room a little bit more sparse.	
1	Those are kind of your living areas are your showcase rooms. That's where you Chain, so you want some Decor that represents you but at the same time you want to be able to there's that balance of wanting to be able to get it straightened up quickly.	
2	Okay.	
1	So those are just some thoughts there and another fun idea for a living area at one of my houses. I did not have very much counter space. So I set up a coffee station in the formal dining room, which was perfect because in that house when you first walked in your in a foyer area with a piano in a bookcase, that's when my kids would make a mess with the bookcase, but I hadn't really thought that through and it looked nice there.	
2	So I just you know, that was just one of our chores was to organize.	
1	Books, but to the right there was a formal dining room that you could see from the front door.	
2	And then I have this chest which I kind of used as a buffet table or a sideboard I guess is the old term for it and you know in the drawers were coffee supplies and whatnot.	
1	And then there was my Keurig. I also had a cappuccino maker up there. I had some decorative mugs. The you know a sign about coffee on the wall, you know, all that type of stuff.	
2	So it was really nice for entertaining and Visually it just looked really welcoming you walk in my home and it's like there's a coffee station come on in and then you'd sit around the dining room table and drink coffee and it looked really pristine because we had another table in the kitchen where we actually ate on a regular basis.	
1	So that's just an idea for you.	
2	Maybe having a coffee station in your formal dining room. But at this house are Keurig is in the kitchen and then I guess the coffee station mentality is still there because I have a little sign about coffee and I keep some bugs and teas and sugar right above the Keurig. So it's still that concept of having everything right there where you need it to make coffee. But it's in the kitchen now, but consider having a coffee station somewhere else. You can get a lot of cute ideas for that on Pinterest. Hopefully you've had enough time to straighten up your living areas.	
1	I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next area before before you start working in the next area though. You might want to get a drink of water. I'm parched right now, and I'm not even cleaning.	
2	I guess it's Talking I'm doing.

1	I'm going to assume that you have one two or three bathrooms. So you can either do each step in each bathroom simultaneously and just kind of run back and forth or you can pick one bathroom to deep clean and then just lightly straighten up the remaining bathrooms, but I'm going to talk you through cleaning a bathroom and there are there are less variables with about The room with the kitchen. I'm like, I don't know if you have a dishwasher. I don't know how many dishes you have to do and things like that, but how we clean our bathrooms is pretty straightforward. So first thing I would do is walk in and see if there's any clutter on the floor laundry towels trash.	
2	What have you I would pick up the floor if there's anything there bonus if there's nothing on your bathroom floor, maybe you don't have kids. Or they're older or well-disciplined. You know, I'd like to think my kids are well disciplined.	
1	But anyway, pick up your bathroom floor next you would clear off the countertop of anything that doesn't belong and also the things that do belong meaning. Maybe there are some lotions on the counter that go in the cabinet underneath the sink, but your toothbrush holder and your toothbrushes Do go there you're going to clear everything off. So some things you're going to put them where they go other things that perpetually belong on the counter. You just going to set them aside.	
2	Clear your counters.	
1	Okay, next you're going to want to spray your mirrors with a glass or multi-surface cleaner and that same step. I also spray the faucets and then I wipe those down could be with a microfiber cloth. That's typically what I use. But if I'm in a hurry and I just walked in there with a roll of paper towels or something.	
2	I might use that because sometimes if I find out somebody's coming over I'll want to go clean my guest bathroom mirror real quick. And if I use paper towels, so be it but typically I use a microfiber cloth.	
1	You can also use newspaper or even an old t-shirt but wipe down the mirror and faucet area and then next I will apply some cleaning products to some key areas like and I'll tell you a product I use but use whatever product you want. I'll put some Scrubbing Bubbles in the sink and then output at toilet bowl cleaner. Be made by Lysol brand or something, whatever and I'll put that in the toilet bowl. If I don't have that dedicated toilet cleaner that has that neck.	
2	I might just pour whatever cleaning product I have on hand into the toilet, maybe even a little bit of bleach because there's already water in there to kind of dilute that bleach.	
1	So I'll pour something into the toilet bowl and then I will if it's a bathroom that has a bathtub. I'll spray the bath tub with the Scrubbing Bubbles.	
2	Okay, next I will wipe down the bathroom countertop and then the sink by then that cleaning product has been in the sink for a couple minutes.	
1	Now, sometimes I'm using a cleaning wipe and I'll just go ahead and use that in the sink as well and I'll wipe that out after wiping down the counter top. I'll throw that wipe away with a couple fresh wipes. I'll wipe the toilet seat. I'll lift it all white behind the seat. Then I'll wipe the rim everything that involves the area behind the hinges between the hinges all that throw those away and then I'll get a fresh wipe or wipes plural to wipe the flusher handle and then the back of the tank which can be kind of Dusty.	
2	And then I'll also wipe around the exterior of the toilet bowl all the way to the base of it and even around the base on the floor. A lot of times. I'm using disinfecting wipes other times. I'm using some type of a cleaning spray and paper towels. I like to use disposable things. When I do the toilets. I don't really like the idea of clean the toilets with Rags, but that's okay if you do that.	
1	Then I will clean out the bathtub now. I like to use a tool with a handle on it so that I don't have to bend as much and I will wipe out the bathtub and you know, rinse it out with that scrubber that has a handle on it and but I will say this. Sometimes I would keep a dish wand in the bathtub like the Scotch-Brite just one that has that receptacle in it.	
2	I'll put half vinegar and half Dawn dish soap in there or whatever dish detergent. Does it really matter the brand I don't think and then you can actually clean the bathtub and shower while you're bathing or showering, you know, just white vinegar and a mild dish detergent dish soap.	
1	So That's when idea but chances are you might have some build up?	
2	So you might be using more of a bathroom product like Scrubbing Bubbles Commodore Ajax, and you know, you're wanting to scrub away that soap scum and that Brown Line that can develop around the bathtub or whatever.	
1	So scrub that out wipe down the handle, you know, maybe you need to go a little bit deeper and actually clean the shelves the walls whatever you need to do if it's a	
2	Dedicated shower with glass shower doors, you're going to want to use a glass cleaning spray and wipe those down inside and out. If you have a shower curtain, you might want to spray a just a shower cleaning product on the inside of the curtain to kind of keep it clean prevent mildew. Another more old-fashioned way would be just a bottle that has a little bit of like a bleach and water solution. But yeah, I would rather use like a shower spray that the smell isn't as harsh. It's more of a pleasant scent.	
1	I don't spray the kids shower curtain that often because I use kind of a cheap one. And a lot of times we have it closed which allows it to air out. You know what I mean, when it's spread out that allows it to are out properly and then that tool that I mentioned about scrubbing the tub with I sometimes scrub the floor of the master shower and even the walls with that same tool.	
2	So that's something that that you might want to do. That's another one of the Scotch-Brite tools, but it's got like a long handle on it. Does it matter the brand but I'm just Just giving you an example so, you know what to look for but there's it's I think it's called a shower scrubber. I've talked about it in a different episode. But if you don't have it, you know that small dish wand will also work. I just use a different dish wand and a bathroom than in the kitchen before I got my shower scrubber.	
1	I would keep a dish want in the bathtub or shower and do that, which I decided I want to get more dish wands because I do like the idea of having one.	
2	Each bathtub or shower so that we can kind of clean as we go and then when it's time to clean the bathrooms I say we I might be the only one that you well my husband would probably use that maybe I could train the kids on it.	
1	Anyway, it makes cleaning session quicker if you're just maintaining your bathtub and showers.	
2	So that's one possible idea and then	
1	By now the stuff has been sitting in the toilet long enough that you would use a brush to scrub out your toilet bowl.	
2	And then if you have any lines or discoloration, that's not coming off. You could use a pumice stone on that.	
1	And of course you're going to wash your hands and it's not that terrible cleaning a toilet and if cleaning the toilet really grosses you out you might not be doing it often enough.	
2	So and maybe you can wrap like a band. Down around your face so that you don't worry about something splashing up. Maybe you can wear gloves, you know, I don't really need necessarily need to do those things when I'm cleaning my own toilet, but it's just an idea but the more often you clean it, it won't be as gross of a job. Especially if people are just kind of using that toilet brush as needed and then I keep it soaking in a solution in a cleaning solution, you know in that holder so, you know, just whatever cleaning It usually kind of pour some in that holder and that makes your bathroom smell nice and keeps your toilet brush disinfected.	
1	So some kind of a disinfectant liquid can go in there lastly remove any bathroom rugs and sweep the bathroom floor and dustpan it and then either mop the floor or maybe wipe it by hand with a disinfecting wipe.	
2	And from time to time anyway, you're going to want to get on your hands and knees and scrub the baseboards and the bathrooms, but this might be a day that you just just sweep and that's it. Because remember you did wipe the floor right around the toilet, which is kind of the danger zone that you want to make sure to disinfect and maybe you also need to wipe your wall behind the toilet your baseboard behind the toilet. If you have little boys that are missing the toilet or big boys that are missing the toilet. It's not an issue here. But I still do you know wipe the floor around the toilet just in case of an accident.	
1	So hopefully by now you've gotten at least your first bathroom clean.	
2	If not, no worries keep plugging away at it, but it might be time to just lightly check your other bathroom.	
1	Maybe you need to make sure there's toilet paper and clean towels maybe need to wipe a blob out of the sink toothpaste blob.	
2	Maybe you want to just wipe down the very bottom of the mirror. Where they're a little bit of dental floss home run. So to speak little little dots that kind of hit your mirror. You want to wipe those off or maybe you want to just sanitized your toilets eat with a disinfecting wipes. And then use another wipe on the flesh or handle. Make sure you got like I said meant, you know enough paper towel or enough.	
1	Toilet paper and stock clean towels hand soap, you know, maybe it's time to throw away some empty shampoo containers or old razors from a bathtub or shower but just straighten up a couple of your bathrooms that might not need to be deep cleaned.	
2	If you have a couple more bathrooms, I have two bathrooms at my house. So sometimes I'll deep clean one and straighten another or sometimes. I'll deep clean them both. So I'll give you a few more moments to work in the bathroom while I talk about some possible bonus chores organizing under the sink.	
1	I think is a big one. If you have a cupboard under the sink that area can get cluttered and you might just need to frankly you might just need to throw some stuff away.	
2	You can't organize clutter. There might be some junk down there that you just never use. We really only need so many products. So it's good to simplify and admit to yourself when a product just didn't work out and you're not using it anymore and just don't buy it again, but you don't need to keep it for three or four years and then you know justify throwing it away at that point by how old it is. If you're not going to use it. Maybe pass it on to a friend or family member or just toss it depending on what it is.	
1	So with a teenage daughter in the house, if a makeup product doesn't work out a lot of times I'll offer it to her and she'll be happy to take it. So definitely Purge any products that you're not using maybe you need to wipe down your bathroom decor. Maybe you need to wash the soap dish or the toothbrush holder.	
2	And that in the dishwasher or something or get them soaking in your kitchen sink?	
1	I know lately. I've been using bars of soap in the master bathroom. My husband and I each have our own sink were pretty much the only people that use those things. I mean occasionally akid might wash their hands their if they used our restroom, but for the most part I have my own sink, he has his own sake and then the kids share a bathroom. So I decided that we didn't really need to have a pump of hand soap in the bathroom and I might change on this later. But right now I keep just a bar of soap but it's sink and one of the reasons I like to do that is sometimes if I'm getting ready in a hurry and I'm not going to take a shower that morning.	
2	I'm going to wait and take my shower in the evening.	
1	I like to just pull my hair back and wash my face and I don't really wash my face with hand soap.	
2	So I like to use a bar of soap in the bathroom that I can. So use on my face and then of course your guests want the soap to come from a pump. So in the kids bathroom / guest bathroom, you know, it's a hand soap pump and sometimes there's also a bar there if you know one of the kids wash their face in the sink, but for the most part they do that in the shower. So I tend to wash my face in the sink on some mornings. So I like to have that there and my husband doesn't seem to mind using a bar of soap in his sink either and I feel like it's a little bit cheaper. So when I mentioned soap dishes that's more in the master bathroom, or maybe it's for someone in your hall bathroom to wash their face with but I do recommend having a pump for guests to wash their hands with when they use the restroom.	
1	So that's all I have to say about bathrooms today.	
2	Let's move on to a bedroom that you're responsible for.	
1	Go ahead and make your bed. Maybe it's a day that you need to change your sheets, or maybe you just need to take 60 seconds and just make the bed but making your bed makes such a huge difference.	
2	Even if your room isn't completely tidied up or whatever. Just making the bed makes a big difference and a lot of times that's kind of the springboard to get your room clean. Once you see your med Bay, once you see your bed made it leads to other cleaning. Like putting clothes in the hamper putting shoes away clearing clutter from the nightstands. And then of course the bonus chores in a bedroom or just like the living areas. Maybe you need to clean a sliding glass door or wipe down a windowsill. Maybe you need to remove clutter. I often need to remove clutter from our bedroom dresser. We tend to accumulate stuff. So from time to time, I need to put those items away where they go. I think everybody has a surface in their house that attracts clutter. For me one of them is definitely the kitchen island is one and then the master dresser is one.	
1	Get your bedroom picked up and maybe even vacuumed and swept. I know my husband appreciates a vacuumed bedroom so that I try to I'm trying to do that more often than I do because I definitely come in make the bed and clear the nightstands when I have my regular cleaning session and put clothes in the hamper, but I don't always vacuum and I think vacuuming forces may not to have a clue.	
2	around the edges of the room and to see things that I might just not notice otherwise Okay, so, you know just around them box up against a wall or boots that haven't been put away in a week or whatever that type of stuff gets dealt with to prepare for vacuuming.	
1	So sometimes you need to vacuum or sweeper room just to kind of force yourself to look at it in a different way and get it vacuum ready.	
2	So to speak and just really clear away that clutter don't store things around the edges of your Out and that's kind of a weak area for me. I think in the master bedroom, you know, I would never do that in the living room.	
1	But sometimes I do that in the master bedroom and then you know, maybe you need to delegate some chores in your kid's room.	
2	Or maybe you have time to work in a kid's room today. Like if you if you keep your master bedroom just really clean and your bed was made a sec the second you got out of it. Maybe you can be working in a child's room or an elderly parents room, but a lot of times after I make my bed, I will fold a load of clean laundry on my bed, and then I'll have people come pick up their piles so to speak so	
1	Let's talk a little bit about clutter in the bedroom. I think I think some people will be able to relate to this.	
2	My bedroom is where I folded and put away laundry because I don't want to be the person that has a pile of laundry on the couch.	
1	Obviously that's you know, the front room on my house and at houses where I had a separate family room. I was more likely to kind of have a little laundry Pile in the corner if that wasn't the front room, but when it's the front room you can't have that. Then you've got a laundry Pile in your bedroom.	
2	Unless you're really good about folding stuff as it comes out of the dryer, but I keep falling on and off of that wagon. Like I said, I've been sick.	
1	Okay, so sometimes when I fold and put away all my clothes, it can be frustrating when there is not room in my drawers for the clothing. So and I don't know if this is going to be relatable for many of you are not but sometimes I need to go through my Roars and hang some things up to make room for things that I want to keep in the drawers because I have more room in my closet than I do in my dresser and I don't want to get another dresser dressers are expensive and I already have a couple plastic units with drawers like one of them is in my master closet.	
2	So I've already gotten all the drawers that I feel I should have and I need to just, you know, see my limitations withdrawal. space not create more space so	
1	What I would do, for example, I have a couple of sports bras that I've only worn a few times. I never wear them.	
2	I would only put them on if I decided to run which I haven't been into running in a long time, but there's always a chance I could decide to start to take up running so I don't want to get rid of them, but I'm tired of seeing those in my drawer taking up space.	
1	So I actually put them on a hanger and put them and they're cute ones like there's	
2	Bright pink one a bright yellow and so it's not like something I wouldn't want to hang in my closet.	
1	I hung them kind of in and out of sight corner of my closet where I put my offseason clothing like my summer clothes because I do have I talked about wearing short sleeve shirts.	
2	I think I mentioned that all the time but I there are certain things that are just summer outfits that I do kind of put off into the corner of the closet.	
1	So I hung those in the closet because I really need to	
2	maximize drawer space and then I realized I was storing some framed decorations that were just things that you know, I got in at thrift stores or whatever that I wasn't using at my current house and I thought you know what I'm just going to I'm just going to get rid of these because they're taking up space in one of my clothing drawers and they probably been in there since we moved so sometimes I have to thin down my drawers and part of it is hanging things up or I found a sweater that should be hanging up.	
1	You know because you need drawers for things like socks underwear.	
2	So sometimes you need to hang the other stuff up, especially if you have more space in your closet, then you do in your drawers. So that's just an idea for your bedroom. Maybe hang up more of your stuff and I do like to have just casual t-shirts and things in drawers, but things that I hardly ever wear like sports bras didn't need to be taking up space. I felt like they were taking up.	
1	Much space hopefully you got a lot done during this cleaning session. One last area that I don't always mention would be like a laundry room. You might not even have a dedicated laundry room. But from time to time, I like to take a cleaning wipe or damp Rag and wipe down the washer and dryer the top of it and then you know kind of as you open the lid those areas around the edges there.	
2	Sometimes you need to sweep around your washer and dryer throw away your lint collection or your empty detergent containers, and then don't forget. To do something outside today. Maybe you need to sweep your back patio or your front porch. Remember your house will be cleaner if you sweep the exterior entrances of your home, and then use welcome mats inside and out, but maybe you need to pull some weeds or you know, pick up some clutter from your yard the sunshine will do you good. Thanks for listening. And as always happy cleaning.
