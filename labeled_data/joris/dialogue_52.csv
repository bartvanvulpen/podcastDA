1	Hey guys, Amy here. Welcome to another awesome episode of mindset with muscle. Now. This episode is all about mirroring and mentors. I'm going to explain a little bit about this. Now. We all need mentors in our lives. We all need somebody to look up to somebody we admire and respect and really a lot of these things are too kind of compare ourselves to where we are on our journey learn from these people and hopefully get healthier happier. Fitter and stronger from these people and what we tend to do is mirror the habits and routines of these people now, there's lots of different things in your life where you can get mentors from you can get business mentors. You can get mindset mentors you can get Fitness mentors and there's many different Avenues and people that you can use as mentors. I certainly use many different people as mentors from reading. Podcasts and actually mentors paying themselves through seminars through coaching lots of different ways and with regards to mirroring that can be such an important thing because if this person has become incredibly successful from doing these habits and routines those successes leave Clues and if you mirror the habits and routines of successful people you tend to start getting success yourself. And it's something that I have done a hell of a lot over reading books and listening to podcast trying new things seeing what works seeing what doesn't and experimenting a little bit and then most importantly sharing it with you guys and girls on this podcast there is however some issues with mirroring certain people. It takes a little bit of time to kind of filter who the real people are who you mirroring a mentoring and to the kind of fake people are and this is kind of something that I've wanted to talk about with regards to social media before now one thing that's amazing about social media and the internet is everyone has a voice and because everyone has a voice everyone has an opportunity but the disadvantage of social media and the internet is everyone has a voice everyone has an opinion and when you're going through your feeds it's very hard to distinguish which one one is real and which one is not and this can also be the problem when it comes to mirroring your mentors knowing what the right things to mirror and knowing who the right people are as those mentors because the trouble with a human Mentor is that you can run into problems because those people can have their own problems because they are human and they have flaws and that can potentially be damaging if You are following them and I did a podcast a long time ago about this called never meet your idols. And the reason that apparently should never meet your Idols is because they're Never As Good As you imagine when they're in real life, but a lot of that is because you've put them on this pedestal of perfection thinking that they aren't human beings and it's important to kind of understand that actually I'm more motivated by someone who messes up more and still achieve success than someone who has had it all. Perfect. And the reality is a lot of those people that you look up to as mentors and you mirror those habits. They've made a lot of mistakes in the past. However, you do run into those problems. It can be disheartening if you're mirroring. All of these habits routines and that person lets you down. It can be disappointing if they're telling you to do the things that you are mirroring and then not doing it themselves. This is a huge issue that I see with A lot of people in personal development, they'll read a few things. They'll do a few posts, but they actually won't take action on what it is that they're saying. It's so much easy to say something then it is to actually do and something that I very much pride in myself on is practicing what I preach and I very hope that some of the people that you are mirroring and you know being mentored by are doing exactly the same. So, how can we get around this problem of Not being let down by these mentors and mirroring the right habits and I came across an incredible post by a dr. Chuck chakrapani. If you don't know chakrapani, he very much takes a lot of the old stoicism books and kind of put some in layman's terms. So they're easier to understand and he has many different concepts which are really thought-provoking and help you, you know answer these questions when it To mentoring and mirroring and he came up with one of these Concepts called what would the sage do and it's all about creating this idealized person and idealized concept that you could only hope to achieve but by reading it every day, you kind of look at the things that are valuable in your life and the things that you know that you really need to do and if you work towards what this idealize Mentor is mirroring. Then you're going to definitely have a very rewarding and very gratitude filled life. So what I'm going to do is read out this because I had a read of it and it literally blew my mind because it's very much what I'm aiming towards every single Den even though I don't get every single day perfect. It's something that I can work towards improving. So here we go. What would the sage do the sage gets up in the morning relaxed? Refreshed he doesn't appear to have any anxiety about the day ahead and he is not mentally rehearsing his Fierce responses to all bad things that might happen to him during the day. He is just confident that he can respond appropriately when the time comes as he walks down the street. Someone says something rude to him, but it doesn't bother him when he gets into the office someone starts arguing with him, but he is not upset he doesn't react to the Persons negativity if it really is the case and insinuations if any but simply addresses their concerns in a calm way, he doesn't a tribute any dark motives to others. He doesn't take offense and doesn't take things personally. He forgives quickly and doesn't brood over things that are over and done with he is not envious of others. He is not afraid of the future for he knows whatever brought him up to this point. We'll continue to guide him. He does not care if he has something or does not he prefers the good things in life, but continues to be happy if he loses things that are dear to him. He looks after his body by working out and being active and nourishes his body with healthy food, but he is not obsessed with his body or his looks he is concerned about other people's welfare and does what he can to help others, but he doesn't obsess over it. He does not carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. Shoulders, so if you look at what that is to me that is somebody's perfect day somebody that you could look up to and try your very best to mirror and it's something that I focus on very much, you know, getting up relax them fresh knowing xiety about the day ahead and not rehearsing and being this kind of reactive mode to the world. You're in a proactive. If mood as soon as you wake up instantly thinking what can I do to change the world today instead of what has the world got in store for me today and understanding that when you get up in the morning, there's going to be problems. There's going to be people unhappy on the Internet is going to be people in work on Happy. There's going to be people calling you out. There's going to be people having a difference of opinion and that's absolutely fine. You can't expect people not to that is normal human. Beings responses, but the most important thing that you can do is not get caught up in it. You can control your responses. You can control how you deal with things. But one thing that you can't control is the actions and attitudes of other people. So why bother another thing I love about this not attributed any dot motives to others not taking offense not taking things personally and focusing on yourself to it looks after his body by working out and being active nourishing. The body but not being overly obsessive about it. And I love that part because what that's saying is look there is a limit to what it is that you do danger is in the dosage with so much in too much of a good thing is also bad for you too. So my kind of challenge for this is for you to think about that idealized concept for yourself. Think about that perfect day. Think about that person that you can look up to that has these kind of similar attributes Not getting caught up in pointless shit on the internet not getting caught up. In other people's opinions selfishly looking after yourself. So you can be more selfless to others giving value to the world and understanding that you are valued in this world based on the skills that you develop to help others. And this is such an incredible thing. I've been reading this every single day for last week and it is really really Because you've never going to have a perfect day. There's going to be things that bother you. There's going to be times where you wake up with a bit of anxiety. There's going to be times where you don't know is your body with healthy food. There's a time where you will be obsessed. By the way that you look but constantly reading this is going to be in your head and very much. Like I said at the end of this podcast is what you put in your head affects what you think on what you do, so my challenge for you ladies and gents is to come up with your Your own version of this and write it out and make sure that you are reading it every single day.
