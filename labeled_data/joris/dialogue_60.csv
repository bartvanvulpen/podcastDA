1	Dust is settled. Everyone's flights have landed and those that didn't have Wi-Fi were able to survive at least those that company begins their back home sick flee and now I can think about more important things. Like what is the top prospect list of the Dodgers look like Beyond some of the rumors we've already heard. It's the cell because God cast intjs just be he is Zack Meisel. What's up, my friend you? No Wi-fi part 2.	
3	Yeah, this one was. Not as dramatic, I guess though. I did want to share. You know, I'm flying back from San Diego on Thursday and like they announced right before takeoff that there would be no Wi-Fi and I'm like, here we go again, like let me put out to the world that I'm not going to have Wi-Fi for the next handful of hours just so that when they inevitably trade Francisco Lindor and I'm just silent and not doing any reporting. It's not my fault and then I realized about I don't know. Most of the way into the flight that United has that they have that I message option. So you turn on their Wi-Fi and you of iMessage so I had nothing else but I had iMessage so I turned it on and you and some other people have texted me. You just said Bill Dance and Eddie a statue and I'm like, oh my God, they traded Linder and they got a hall from the Dodgers like and this is seriously happening happening now, and I texted you back and I said, All right, I think well it was in the Chicago. So I had a layover in Chicago. So it was on the Chicago part of the flight and you know that flights like 45 minutes. Yeah, and I think I had 25 minutes left in the flight and I'm like do I need to pay the 1099 for Wi-Fi for the you know, even though I'm gonna have to put away my laptop in 10 minutes and you're like no calm down. It's some knucklehead who covers the Falcons on the radio who comes out with this room, but I was pretty panicked there for a couple of Minutes and I thought we were going to have a legitimate part 2 to the annual tradition of not having Wi-Fi in a cross-country flight after the winter meetings.	
1	Yeah, something about airplanes in the Indians getting stuff done. It was a few years ago trying to hammer out a contract with Santana last year actually acquiring Santana back this year. It could have been blind or but the six exclamation points were only matched or the six question marks. You sent me were only matched by the 600 was that you receive back in your text with the quote-unquote Rival executive.	
3	Yeah, and I mean, I it's not like I reached out to say hey, like what do you think about this offer? Because I would not you know take that seriously, but someone had texted me and had that response and I was like, I can't not share this because Twitter was going crazy people were believing this guy for some reason and so we put that to bed. Well Oliver. Well, I want to see the one thing that didn't dawn on. till now that would have you know, I never needed to panic because I scheduled a really early morning flight back and with the stopped at Chicago because I assumed that's the flight that the Indians front office Executives would take turns out they took a later flight closer to lunchtime. So they were in the air when all that was going down and when you had texted me and so I don't know why I panicked because I think they're means would have been pretty limited engaged in quote unquote serious talks as aunt.	
1	He pushed his chair back a little bit and got kicked six times by the infant behind him and chernov is trying to order seeing if the if Sprite falls under the free part of the in-flight service or if he yeah.	
3	Yeah, it was probably first the first trade ever completed while one GM had a stroopwafel in their mouth.	
1	I don't know if that's factual or not. So I'm going to have to back it up with a second source, and of course. It's the only thing those rumors really successfully did was raise the bar to an unobtainable level for the enhancing these Lindor Terry Scott sessions. So now anything that's not a complete highway robbery by the tribe, which the rumors that were out there. Absolutely were you and I have talked in this podcast that we don't know if the Dodgers straight up would do Lindor for Lux and if that was presented to you or I I think I would very strongly consider accepting that offer if I'm the Indians. Yet the offer was Luxe plus six other seven other nine other guys that were really really talented. So and in really nice lot money, of course and really didn't pass the smell test, but it did make for a fun at least 20 minutes or so of taunting you and whether or not I was actually being factual or not because I sent you the tweet and the Tweet went along with the build antonetti a statue Now text which if you receive both you Have understood my sarcasm, but when you didn't get the Tweet part of the text because you're in the air you only got the text message. So then that's initially all you get and then what I what I sent back was another picture. I think I screenshot of the tweet and try to send it to you that way but that also didn't go through and then I said something else which could have been interpreted as they just made this fantastic trade. So I am glad that I at least cause you at least some mild Panic while you're in there.	
3	Thanks Jay. Couple of years off my life, but the craziest part to me was that there were some fans some Indians fans who were saying still probably not enough. I'm like, what are you expecting? I do think we need a little bit of a reality check when it comes to what fair trade offers would be. I think like I mean, I think the Dodgers are struggling to come to terms with the idea of even including Gavin Luxe by himself. Like that's it. Yet you're having people saying like Lux plus May plus Verdugo. I would definitely need all three of them and then it probably want like another piece or and it's like that's not how this works and teams treasure young controllable cheap Talent more than ever. And guess what the Dodgers have a really really smart front office. So yes, Dave you think you're sick of the Indians winning 90 plus games every year and not doing anything about it. Dodgers fans are so sick of the Dodgers winning. Seven straight NOS titles and having nothing to show for it with a massive payroll and robust farm system, but still their teams are disciplined and the Dodgers have a really good front office and they're not just going to throw everything at the wall to get Lindor for two years and maybe they could reassign them. But, you know teams just don't do that. I think it used to be a lot easier to pull off this sort of trade because there are there were more dumb front offices. I don't think I think there's only a couple of now and those teams probably are pretty bad. So you're not going to be dealing with them in this situation.	
1	So need gets it gets really dangerous when the smart teams are also the rich teams like the Yankees who have been so very disciplined over the past several years fans screaming go back to the days of old when you threw money at everybody and that's not the way they had operated for the past several years until this offseason and when the perfect storm for them got laid at their feet they needed in a starter Gerrit Cole is Guy that just doesn't seem like he has any alarming issues tied to him at least at the moment. I know that's knock on wood for any pitcher, but there's a reason why he got the money he did and pretty much everybody agrees that he's probably worth it. And so it became a layout for them to be able to get it done. But in the past they have been operated like the Yankees. We used to see in the before the mm rolled around and they were winning world. Oops year after year after year, it's been a little bit of a different dynamic in that front office. And they the Dodgers are sort of a similar team we talked about this when we initially started talking Lindor rumors at the beginning of the offseason and I said one of the things that I think will be interesting is how desperate to these teams get where you've been operating this way like the Dodgers have where you have the strong farm system. You already have a really deep talented roster. You probably don't need to do a lot but are the fans starting to get it to you. There are Upset is just winning the division every single year and hoping that you the two random randomness your way into winning a world title. Are they going to be happy with that or are they going to feel some pressure and that was always something in the back of my mind that that thought. I thought maybe that was something that could help push or escalate a trade of Lindor to a situation like LA because if they're just evaluating this based on spreadsheets and surplus-value. Value years of control cheap control at that guy's that allow them to spend more money on other parts of their roster through free agency. If they would like to the one thing was going to change that was that sense of desperation and needing to change the the way they've gone about things in the past several years and we'll see because They didn't come away with that that major free agent peace or trade piece as of yet. So are they going to feel that sense of desperation as this winter unfolds? I don't know but that was the one thing that was kind of a wild card in my line for getting these these sorts of this sort of trade done.	
3	Right and the Indians could prey on that because they could just say well we'll keep them. He's a perennial All-Star will keep him for two years. We don't have to trade him to you but along those lines I'm also Thinking it's only a matter of time before another team gets in the mix or is leaked to be in the mix because that just drives it up even more. You know, if the Dodgers insist they don't want to include Gavin Lux. Well, then the Indians can leak to someone and say hey we've talked to the Atlanta Braves or the Cincinnati Reds or another team about a Lindor trade and and then maybe the Dodgers get a little more desperate. But you know, I also think having just I'm Just going to completely debunk everything. I just said I also think front office's don't fall for that stuff the way we all do media fans the public, you know, I think they have a pretty good grasp of what's really going on. And yes, they do pay attention to trade rumors and and National reporters and whatnot. But you know that they use that to check on things to get what the legitimate scoop is and not necessarily what's out there. So it's going to be interesting. You're right. You know how desperate to the Dodgers get do they really feel like Gavin Lux can be as good as Francisco Lindor and more importantly do they feel like he can be as good as Lindor right now. I don't know but I mean you look up and down that roster and there's like 15 to 20 guys. I'd have interest in if I was if I were the Indians, I mean, there are so many directions they could go but you probably need Lux in the deal to feel comfortable because this isn't just this isn't just like Find the best match and let's do it. This is overwhelm us enough that we feel comfortable going to ownership and convincing them to sell their franchise face of the franchise and you know, probably sacrifice some season ticket sales and some fan sentiment knowing that hey you might be a better team and you'll certainly be a better team long-term Beyond 20/20 one. But like this is going to sting even if you get a really good return even if you quote unquote win the The trade and all the people who love to get a handout letter grades 10 seconds after a trade happens for some reason, you know, you're even if you win those and you get an A-Plus like it's still going to hurt at the Ballpark at in the ticket office. So you're going to have to be overwhelmed. That's why I think Lux probably has to be in the deal no matter what even if you to a mean like in a vacuum like Dustin may + Alex Verdugo + Chris Taylor plus Joc Pederson Plus Like Max Muncie is an amazing Hall. But like I still think I still think it's got to be Luxe. I still think you need that Marquee slam-dunk piece. And I think especially Indians fans by now are probably saying it's got to be Luxor.	
1	We're not going to be happy Indians fans Indians for an office to I would venture to say that that's probably the takeaway that they have if they want to go draft day. They put a note in their pocket and it says Gavin Lux or nothing walk away and so I I have a certain faith in their ability in these negotiations to be able to walk away because we've seen in the past they They stick to their guns on this this sort of thing. They very rarely will meet you too far in the middle. They'll make trades. They think are fair and I don't know if they're necessarily trying to go out there and and Rob anybody but they have in their mind what they think is fair value in return for their guys. And if you're not willing to match it unless it's a situation where they're losing the player at the end of the year or the player doesn't really factor into their plans. They're prepared to just say no. Thanks and keeping Francisco. Lindor is one hell of a Secondary prize and I could argue is probably the first prize but as you've laid out before you've written we've discussed in this podcast the last week. If you do hold on to them, then you better you better make that worth it. You need to make that move count for something because once once you pass this winner and you the season starts to me, it's like a car driving on a brand new car driving off the lot the minute it does that the value has declined a bunch and lens or anything. Your cars, no kidding the luck. I have and Lindor is a I mean you're already starting with the value that is through the roof. So even if you're treating him for one year, you would give back something useful, but you're not going to get back. Somebody's top prospect like Gavin Lux, that's not happening. If you trade him. I think if you go through the end of this offseason and you hold on to him you can wave goodbye to anyone getting anyone close to that level.	
3	yeah and weeks we've said it when you record three podcasts and week, I guess you can send a repeat yourselves, but it's I think you trade them now or you don't trade him at all and What makes this tricky is that you probably have definitely have multiple contingency plans. But you have to act on it that this offseason is certainly moving more quickly than the last few have and like if your end if you end up keeping Lindor, well, okay, then you got to go find your second baseman. You got to see if you can add to the Outfield. You got to see if there's a starting pitcher you want to move to get some offense if help do you need to supplement the bullpen if you trade Lindor Maybe He says you get back influence how you do part 2 if you don't trade Lindor you obviously have a plan for part two, but like at what point do you just move on and do decide? Okay talks are done. We're keeping them and we're going to go set our sights on all these other things we have to do and maybe once you start doing all those things it complicates the Lindor talks if the Dodgers end up getting desperate in mid-January and her like we got to do this we've missed out on too many guys.	
1	Yeah. I mean you said it before this impact. Every single thing they do for the rest of this winter and knocking it out now would be an advantageous because then you can start to set up what your team looks like without him. But if you hold on to him now and you start to make moves that is in anticipation of what a roster looks like with Francisco Lindor and then the trade comes you probably still make it but it's going to be a lot more difficult trying to make that audible on the Fly and then it becomes even more interesting as these trade talks unfold as you're sitting there and as a front office you think you're Maybe You're starting to make some progress and then the the other side of the table says yeah, we're sorta into it. But you know what we might need a guy like Mike Clevenger coming back.	
3	Yeah, so, I mean that's how a name gets tossed out there. I don't know the veracity of the report that was was out there. I mean if you look at the facts. If you traded Lindor and Clevenger separately you get so much more than if you treated them together, you could find a team desperate for starting pitching trade them Clevenger and get a top prospect. And then some you trade Lindor and Clevenger together and it's like yeah, you're gonna get a huge haul but you could get a huge haul for both of them separately. I think the the more realistic thing first of all as I've said they're going to go to Clevenger and Bieber at some point in the next month or two and say let's talk Extension. I think there's a better chance Beaver signs agrees to something then Clevenger does but as we said like Clevenger was a late bloomer. He's about to be 29 years old. It's going to hit free agency at about 30 right before his 32nd birthday. I don't know if it seems going to give you that. They're not going to give you the Gerrit Cole Stephen Strasburg type deal at that age. So it's and you gotta prove yourself in the next three years. So it's a little riskier. So maybe he signs. Maybe he doesn't if he doesn't And I think he does become a logical trade candidate a year from now not the type of thing where like Trevor Bauer where they really wanted to get rid of them. But you explore just like they have with tons of other guys, but I don't think it makes much sense to trade him. Now. I don't think it makes any sense to include him in a Lindor deal to sweeten the pot. I think you could dangle kluber in that package certainly maybe a younger picture. But yeah, I think you keep them separate and then During Bieber or the reason why you feel like whether you trade Linda or not, you're still going to contend and be a threat to win the division and make some noise in the playoffs.	
1	I was just trying to look I try to remember when Max Scherzer signed his deal because in my mind, I was thinking it with with the Tigers. He didn't truly become really special until late into into his Tigers career who's kind of League average me a little bit better picture up until but very durable very durable true and that was part of Of his Allure, especially when he really took off in 2013. That was his first 200 Innings season. He puts it together another one with the Tigers in 2014. So he had put together back-to-back season was where he looked like a front of the rotation guy at 200 Innings, but he had done that at the age of 29. So he and his free agency entering his age 30 season. That's a lot different than another 2 years beyond that I'm saying for Clevenger. Maybe maybe he builds himself up to to that. sort of level consistent But as you said you would be risking it more as a team at the age of 32 and there are already people that were a little bit nervous I guess is the best way I can put it about the deal that Scherzer sign with the Nationals. And again, he did that entering his age 30 season. So that's a little bit of a different situation but that was a little bit surprising that to me sounded like the Indians rolling through all these names in the Dodger said, oh well, if you're going to roll through all these guys that you like we also would like to make a Of it at Clevenger and then the Indians being the Indians a team that is just there not going to hang up or in this case walk out the door. Just based on you bringing up a name. They'll say okay. Let's talk Clevenger. This is what are realistic thought is on him and they would discuss him and even by the Indians entertaining it just to say we would expect you to give up this completely unobtainable amount of talent in return for Clevenger. You've now quote unquote discussed it. No, I'm not we're not we're not sitting in there. I don't know how as you said I don't know how aggressive these talks actually work. But to me discussing it means that the Indians entertain almost anything and if the fact is that they spent four or five minutes talking about it. They have already discussed it and then at that point leaking that sort of report is factual you did discuss adding my Clevenger to it, but it was completely and totally off the table in terms of reality. That's just the way that I interpret it well and they always	
3	Cincinnati loves to tease us and torment us and say we would never believe half the shit that they actually discuss and that doesn't mean they want to do it. It's just I mean, I we always bring in hbd but it's it is legitimate like it's in some ways reflects real life where it's like if someone tells me they have interest in my star player. I have no interest in moving that player but I'm going to say, okay. What do you want to give me? What do you got just to see because you know Never know and it could help you down the line when you want to reconnect to actually make that trade when you're more willing to move that player.	
1	So and is it a useful just to know what other teams think of of your guys hours it helps it all and that's what the winter meetings are.	
3	It's just about it's about until it's just about Gathering as much as you possibly can you're Under One Roof. You can't leave your sweet or else you get swarmed by crazy people in the lobby. And so you just sit up there and you talk about different scenarios with your fellow front office members and you You talk to other teams and see what they're doing you talk to agents to see what other teams are doing. So that's what this is. And and I also think I mean, it's crazy. I'll and I know fans this is this is a different situation like last year. I think fans grew tired of the kluber Bauer stuff because it just seemed like it was a different report every day and then nothing ever happened. This is different. This is the face of your franchise. This is a franchise shifting decision one way or the other. You're setting yourself up for the next decade one way or the other so I get it. But also like I landed yesterday there were a couple like vague reports and a specific report from someone who's probably never even been to an Indian's game and like everyone's panicking and saying I bet something's going to happen in the next five ten minutes or like we're getting close where there's smoke there's fire and it's like don't be surprised if this lingers I mean this is yeah. This is not the sort of thing that just gets hashed out in one. Dinger one phone call over an hour like this is this is a lot of back and forth between two smart front offices. And again, like even if the if the Dodgers are like will give you Lux and we'll give you may and you give us kluber and Lindor and the Indians are like, we really like this deal like this is this is definitely what we need to do. They still should go and talk to other teams and be like, can you top this like this is going to take a while and I think there are a lot of keep saying hurdles are off. Pickles but there's just a lot of things that you have to check off before you make a trade like this and I won't believe it until incarcerated.	
1	Bob has it.	
3	What did he did he tweet something this week and you were trying to tell me that was legit.	
1	This week. No, I don't remember this week. I see I am such a fan of the more rumors the better because I can process it. I can I can sift through them and take away from what is reality and what maybe fiction and what is just being put out there and what actually has legs. So if anyone wants to go through the ESPN trade machine and fire up some fake trade that they came up with. I love it. I want to digest it. I just Love trade discussion. I love thinking about what players are worth and rumors are fun. So incarcerated Bob whether he's on he's nailing a rumor or completely off base. I love it. Nonetheless. So nobody can we also say I mean, I've seen the train he had that he had the Swisher news back in 2013, man. Marries Bushman. He's got the receipts.	
3	Well, I wish when he loved down and out when he found it out ahead of time. I'm he should have tried to put a stop to it. I do want to say something about the trade machine though. I mean it's it is interesting. So Paul horns was was asking Chris Hansen Eddie about kind of the mechanics of Trades and how they decide what a player's value is and God bless onesie because that's not something you can answer simply in a 30-second reply or but you know the teams they basically assigned a dollar value to every player in every system and it's You know, you're not trying to match up. You're just trying to get an idea for what a player is worth might be over the Long Haul and the thing is is Linus has woken up from a slumber. The thing is like when you're trying to find a match for an Indian's Dodgers trade. It's not going to be even the team that's taking on the younger less proven players is the team that needs to have that higher number because there's more risk involved, you know, so you're not trying to trade Lindor if he's valued at 80 million and you're not trying to trade him for 80 million dollars of surplus of value of prospects. You got to get more back. And so that's that's I think that's one error.	
1	I keep seeing people who love the trade machine and you can hear Linus who really is sick of reading about fake traits to and there are people inside organizations no names, please that all they do is sit there and try to dream up trades for people that are higher up try to find that fair value and target people. That's all they do all day long.	
3	Anyway, that's that. I wish I had that job.	
1	That's what I do in HPD all freaking dead. I do want to Pat myself on the back for one thing though. I did mention that I thought the Angels would make a lot of sense for Corey kluber and then like three hours later. There was actual smoke on that so good job TJ, putting that together anybody with a third grade education could have match those two, but I did it on the podcast and then it became reality.	
3	Yeah, they make sense for the Angels. Love that pairing makes as much sense for the Indians. I think the Angels would probably have to overpay just based on. Their system. It's such a weird. It's a weird thing anyway, because as we've talked about so many times like Obviously kluber does not have Peak trade value right now, you know, you're better off waiting six months or taking a time machine to go back a year or a year and a half. So you're asking a team to take on the contract and I know we've said like the contract is fine. As long as he turns out to be even an adequate picture but no one knows what he's going to be and so it's like you somehow still have to convince a team to give you a really useful piece. Otherwise, it makes more sense to just hold them. And the angels are weird team because they're so top-heavy and their farm system is a lot better than it was a few years ago. When it looks like Mike Trout was just gonna waste away like Tom Hanks in Castaway with Albert Pujols as Wilson, but it's I just made a movie reference like we hate document this podcast, but I think my name is void dumbass. That's that's a good reference. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what they eventually do with him because Because I think it's it's difficult to find if you're going to trade him. Now, then you some team is has to get desperate and I almost think the opposite of the Clevenger thing think of me more sense if the Dodgers liked kluber and believed in him just param with Linda or and see if that'll make a difference.	
1	Yeah, when all those names started dropping it was just spitting out. Hey this guy and this guy and this guy I'm thinking for Linda or yeah, but they're also trying to give them kluber and something else you miss it half the trade on the Indian side, I would imagine We just spitting out locks and made this catching Prospect and this infielder and that outfielder in this pit. That's what this is from an Indian's perspective where you and I are thinking about this. How can the Indians win every trade? Even you and I are going. All right. Hold on.	
3	It's a this is a completely unfair. We need to step in here.	
1	This is not fair to the Dodgers if they pull off a smooth flow. So as I said, if nothing else, it's raise the bar to a level. That when if and when they actually do trade lend or it will look nothing like this trade and so everyone is going to be pissed off they're going to be pissed off regardless, but they're really going to be taste.	
3	Yeah, the only time I'm trying to think of I feel like we usually say immediately when the Indians make a trade that they got the better end of it. Don't we like I mean, I think the night that Trevor Bauer got traded it was like we found out one named after another and it was because at first it was like think we do we try to remember the order because I was going all around the room trying to get Intel from players is they heard from people or Get you know, you get a text from a front office person at one point or a an Asian and and it's like you slowly pieced this together and each piece. It was like, oh my God, this is like better and better. It's unbelievable. I feel like most of the Indians trades your immediate takeaway is they got the better end. Like I remember like the Eric Gonzalez trade and who knows how that will end up it was said like a three four. Three or three four two. Yeah, and obviously Max Mara was a bust but like Jordan loop low looks like he's going to absolutely destroy left-handed pitching and maybe more and they have them for a long time and are cazalas every time he played on the field last year. He injured one of his teammates. So that looks like it's immediately that seemed like a decent trade because Lupo had a pretty good minor league pedigree. The only one that didn't was was the on Gomes trade and we all look foolish now, Your Roberto Perez had and seeing what Daniel Johnson could do. So I feel like they always seem to win trades immediately. And I mean like obviously long-term. They do Francisco. Mejia hasn't done anything and the Padres have like been in the market for catching. I hope so. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what that sentiment is. Like if they end up trading Lindor who is everybody's favorite player and clearly the best player and on the roster Like fans allow themselves to say man. It sucks losing Lindor, but holy shit.	
1	What Hall they got ya can't both things be true. Yeah. That was all there was a little bit true in the bower aspect. It's like, oh man. Well, you lost the front of the rotation arm that you would have had next year. But look at everything you got so have the Indians won every single trade. I don't know. Did they win the trade? Did they win the trade when they In his dribble Cabrera to the Nationals for Zach Walters.	
3	No, but I also I mean guys who are two months from free agency and don't have much trade value. I don't put that on them. I will say the one other one that made you scratch your head at least was last year with trading ideas because I don't think people like that but that wasn't like especially at the time because people didn't really know about Jack Bauer's and he was a top under Prospect like that wasn't what I don't I cannot think of an example ample where they made a trade and it was like, oh my God, they get host. What are they doing? Like you usually have a pretty good feeling about the deal at the moment and it's going to be interesting because like the Dodgers of their their roster and their farm system are loaded. There's so much opportunity, but I don't know it's going to be if they don't include Lux. Is there a way for fans to be no?	
1	No, probably in reality know if we're living in within the realm of things that can actually happen. Probably not and the in the IDS thing. I put more on ownership anyways, because I don't think the front office really wanted to trade you ideas. It was something that needed to happen money-wise to enable the Encarnacion Santana thing to happen. So I put that on ownership more than I put it on the front office Dolan's cheap, right? Mmm and stream Anna Santana did come back and have a hell of a year best year. He's ever had so Yeah, I guess we'll see. We'll see what Johnny D's continues to become a we'll see if Jake Bowers ever puts it together. Certainly this time last year Bauer's look like a very interesting piece.	
3	But now he's a guy that we don't even talk about on this podcast and Ian DT is could be your third baseman with Jose at second base Tony for work.	
1	He still needs to work on that defense.
