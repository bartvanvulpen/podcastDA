1	I feel like well, yeah, you got it. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks so much for having me.	
3	Yeah, welcome back. Welcome back.	
1	Thank you. Good day. Good to be back.	
3	Yeah, and you are or your relationship to marijuana is what I mean not super often at this point.	
1	I'm a really bad sleeper. For a while that was kind of my thing was like, oh, you know, it'll help me sleep a little bit, but I was just finding that like I'd have very very vivid dreams, which wasn't great. Okay, wake up exhausted right? So I stop that but yeah, I don't know occasionally.	
3	That's so interesting because for a lot of people like marijuana makes them not remember their dreams. Eames yeah, he's yeah, everybody's brain chemistry so different so you're not using it to sleep anymore. No, so do you ever tried CBD or a one-to-one?	
1	Yeah CBD I've tried yeah again, I just find that it makes my dreams. So like it feels like I'm I think I can normally kind of pick what happens in my dreams when I'm dreaming and I absolutely can't you have like lucid dream.	
3	Yeah. Yes. So cool. What if you're like Thanks, but if you're like a like a superhero and this it's like trying to uncover.	
1	This is my superpower.	
3	Oh, no what and you have to you have to keep doing it in order to nurture that that superpower of just being exhausted when I wake up in the morning. Yeah, I think that's normal. I think all superheroes are probably exhausted most of the time. Yeah. You're right.	
1	I think I'm up all day Bjorn rather be able to fly. Yeah, then this this feels like maybe Not a great superpower nightmares.	
3	Yeah, what's your superpower nightmares? I have a lot of nightmares. And where are you on a scale of 1 to 10 right now?	
1	I feel like I'm melting but I'm wrapped in a wet towel if that makes sense.	
3	And for the listeners at home. She is not.	
1	No. I'm not I know that well great.	
3	Well, thanks for coming back. Thank you. Once again, both of you guys. I know you guys don't consume a lot of cannabis. It's it's always fun to have comedians on that. Don't don't consume as much. You're so lucky so lucky so lucky. You guys are here. Let's go up to this first segment real fast. Shall we before we get to the comedic challenges? This first segment is called weed news.	
1	Wait news.	
3	So we news is basically where we talk about something that is in the news. That's about wheat pretty pretty straightforward. And I think this one is really interesting because it's a scientific study about cannabis has role in Intimacy in romantic intimacy, basically and what they found is that and Ultimately, like, you know, they also compared it to alcohol and one thing that is sort of like that. They found is that alcohol can definitely have very very negative effects on intimacy, especially when one person is doing it versus both people and that both people drinking alcohol together can potentially build intimacy, but if one person is drunk in the other person is not it's very difficult, but with cannabis they found that it worked always if one person was using cannabis and one wasn't they still found that it actually was helping build intimacy with the partners when both of them were using it that definitely was helping build intimacy. Let's say how they're measuring intimacy out of curiosity most fucks in a day. I think it's just all like I think it's all the like nuanced like conversation and with like psychologists and stuff. I'm imagining because it's such a unmeasurable thing, you know? Yeah, which I think is really interesting. I mean, you know, I also just think that like it's personal for you know, everybody's different hmm, but it kind of makes sense to about the alcohol aspect of it.	
1	Well, how are they conducting this study? All right, people just filling out a little survey or something like that to be know.	
3	They I think they like studied specific couples over the course. I should probably tell people where they can read this what if it's just like the researchers just talking to their Partners like we have to get high a bunch and like have sex a lot for a month. Oh, that's funny. There's like it's a great reason to do it. There's no other there's no one else in the study. It's actually an a bunch of different places marijuana moment the French toast, so these are the organizations that conduct the scientific journals that scientific journals in Kentucky. Yeah. It was one guy and his girlfriend Psychology today Sakai Psychology today Leafly map sponsored article you'd be worried for psychology today that it's amongst these other. Shins, I know it's like Psychology today has an earned it yet.	
1	Hmm. No, they haven't earned it.	
3	They can't they can't stand with the esteemed marijuana moment. Yeah or fresh toast. What are you kidding those? These are the journalism organizations that are keeping our country accountable. Yeah. Absolutely the Canada dude Canada lift. I mean, this is why marijuana will have a problem like being taken seriously. I've always thought that would like after it's been legalized and become a medical thing and all that. It's still funny how all the strains have the same name. So it's like a doctor is being like yeah, I got to prescribe you a gram of cat piss. They gotta change the names to no legitimacy and the name like a lot of actual drugs names are like like a beautiful complex Latin words, you know and like with marijuana. It's like there's literally a strain there's like Alaskan Thunder Fuck Like a strain of weed it's silly silly silly. I mean, I'd argue some of those medications would sell better if they were named as a very true your child has a cold. Don't worry. Don't worry. Yeah. Also just wide it why does medicine need to sell better? Hey, we gotta get this medicine off the off the shelves now, we're in some cereal instead of treating baby, right? That's right. There it is.	
1	Taking them down from the inside.	
3	That's right. Yeah, those weed news. So, you know audience if you're if you and your significant other like to use cannabis to get intimate, maybe you want to read that article. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just search for it. Let's jump to our first segment here. Shall we? This first segment is called the high pathetical situation. So the hypothetical situation is basically you guys are high and I'm going to give you a hypothetical situation and you're going to act that hypothetical situation out and anybody else can sort of jump in and improvise and play along totally open. Open Fields open field rules Guys open field freestyle. Um Open Season Open Season. Mmm Open Season and profs a lot of ways to skin the animated film. Yeah. It's the most unhelpful and like demeaning thing to say it is like oh, yes, there's a lot of ways to say what you're saying and so every hypothetical situation as a theme and we have a special theme for you guys because Cuz you know you guys do produce this show together. And are you the two and it's based off of an actual show and that show was on a network called MTV? Yes. That's just the MTV. Yeah bumper and so it's gonna be our theme is MTV did so did you guys watch a lot of MTV growing up?	
1	I was not allowed to know it was I saying so close as my dad ever came to grounding me, but then he'd get lonely and want to hang out. So I'd be underground.	
3	So I was it I grew up in a different country, but here was MTV when you guys were growing up. Music videos still or was it all the other stuff again? I was not allow you didn't even know so he didn't know why he was saying no, I like was he saying? No because if you know what I mean videos or because of like Beavis and but they were very they were mostly concerned about the TV shows. I think yeah, it was like the reality show. I mean, they also like pretty anti like all the music I like to you know, but I feel like it was definitely like the real world and all this real world. I mean, I still would sneak downstairs and like watch it as might like it was my drug and My mom also like lost her mind once when we were at a dinner party at her friend's house and then like all the boys all this teenaged little like 13 year old boys it like crowd around this tiny TV in the basement so much parental control. That's very funny like and like they literally thought we were playing like they had this this this family like a huge Lego thing and they thought we were playing with that. But like we were literally criminal we watched Samurai Jack and then we've switched to them and lets you know, what was I know what I got a few people who are on that show parental Roll that we know that are you - I know want to know who they are. Yeah.	
1	Yes is may be crazy to ask. What is Parental Control?	
3	Can I say what it is? Yeah, of course. Yes. I don't want to derail whatever no no, okay. So parental control. The premise of parental control is they take two parents and they don't like their child's significant other so they want to they want to take control and aren't they I dition a bunch of people too. Be their child significant other will take them on dates and stuff. We talked about today and then and then so they each they do these auditions that each pick one and then their kid goes on the day goes on the dates that their parents prepared and then the parents and like the bad significant other all watch it from their couch and their living room and like comment on it that's brilliant. There's an episode you can find online. So we'll call Todd was one of the bad days. There's going to Gili. There's a couple other I guess of the show you can look really I did not know every apparently everyone who was like grew up in Los Angeles and was like 16 and had any aspirations been comedy and stuff. There's no that's who they betting on that show clucking hello and then present them as a real thing. But I'm of course you don't have any more able to vaguely umbrellas. All right. Sure. I loved it. It was a great great show. So so Vic, you don't have a lot of experience or not growing up.	
1	Definitely do at this time. It is my life. I love are you the one Aha and the challenge has been good watching through the watching The Challenge watching the old ones.	
3	Yeah the way howl like the duel.

3	Great. I don't even know I don't even know what the challenge is real world/road rules challenge. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's called The Challenge now. It's just called The Challenge though. I see cool.

1	Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, I am. I not in the right place.	
3	Oh, so so you think that this show is about a father of a teenager. Mmm a teen dad. Yeah. I mean what I will say is if you come early because you are 25 and your son is at least 13. If you'd come here when he was just born I would be interested because you would have been a teenager. That's right worked out there. That's really what the show is. Yeah. That's really what the show yeah. Yeah. It's that's wrong.	
1	That's wrong. Yes, Father. 12 year old father of a chat minimum, maybe maybe even yeah, I'm sorry.	
3	I'm sorry. First of all first I was very capable. I was very careful and I gotta tell you guys first of all, first of all, I'd there was a guy bringing pistachios in here a minute ago when I was waiting outside and I told me you guys were busy and that he should come back later up the meeting you kidding me fucking kidding me.	
1	Are you fucking kidding?	
3	Okay, you you will pay for this sir. You will pay for this you guys should pay for this.	
1	Where's your baby?	
3	You guys are kidding right? It's got to be about a the dad of a team, right? Right. No, it's where we take a look deep inside the complicated and difficult challenging lives of young teen father's like your life. Ten years ago. Yeah between the age I was a 12 year old dad.	
1	I was a 12 year old that weight her pretty that makes you a preteen Dad.	
3	Yeah. Listen, I was 12 years old - well write that down Vic right free T9. That's actually a really It's coming. I don't order a pencil there was a bang goes. Was it coming? Like 50 minute? Where's that? Where's the pen again company? Wow, that's really funny that you bring up that because I saw a pen guy earlier so many pens and I was just like dude. They're they're in there interviewing potential fathers of teens for this show I sent away and I'll tell you when I was sent away got an argument. The pistachio guy came out and was like what's going on here and I say get the fuck out of here, dude, they're there in the middle of a meeting right now, so I sent both of them away. Damn it. Okay, we're down pens and pistachios, but try to remember preteen preteen dad. That's a good idea for a show 14.

He might just be them most normal man in America. Oh my God. Okay. What if we just follow the life of the most normal man just a complete inside look into mediocrity. Hmm. That's an incredible idea.

1	Not bad vibes Vibes.	
3	Get out of here. DJ blue dreams. Goodbye, perhaps minute. Yes. I always have something that gives you some good vibes. Sometimes they're like videos or Clips or something sometimes or just nerdy things that I found out people might know this already because it's obviously been around a while. But this is a little factoid that if you search for any article on Wikipedia and you keep clicking the first link in it the first link outside of a parentheses, so not like if the scientific word something to have that but you keep going the first link you have a D7 and 98% chance like almost every page leads to philosophy eventually because philosophy is like the mother of all Sciences or thought. Oh, whatever ouch so let's try it out. Someone throw me a topic. I'll Google it will look it up look up its Wikipedia page and then we'll try it out. I mean, let's just so any topic any topic and be like a character from a video anything any any Wikipedia page has a 98% chance if you keep clicking the first link on it of let's start with Let's just start with cannabis. Right cannabis searching for can of cannabis is Wikipedia page so we could cannabis right now. Okay, there's one outside of the parentheses is genus. Click that that leads to taxonomic right here, right that leads to us. Add the parentheses. Where what's the first link here at this? Or is it no this is still an applied its methods of science science science science, which leads to Latin which here we go classical language. It's least the language which leads to communication. We're getting close which leads to meetings. It's the semiotic which leads to sign process.	
1	We're getting further away.	
3	Hey, buddy. That's crazy. Here we go. Some of them are quicker somewhere less. But yeah, well Nana's you guys throw out a thing.	
1	That's Del P. What Zach dolphy the CH E LP LP E. I think what's this exact BB. He was a player for the Vancouver Canucks when he was so bad. He played one game and then was kicked out kicked off the guys. Well, I don't know if he's kicked out, but he doesn't play for the connection. Oh, wow. Okay, right so here is act.	
3	Now, please that's very funny Canadian professional centers centers the words under an ice hockey which leads ice hockey which leads to contact for contact team sport which reads the sports which leads to competitive. It's going to be closed which leads to this is a zero-sum game. Zero Sum game which leads to Game Theory which is the mathematical models, which is the system which leads to the first one is all the way down here Greek right Latin. Is there Latin Soul? Yeah right here. Oh, yes button, which leads to classical Tango? So we're back on the same path, which may be crazy. It's the Nana is bananas into meaning to semiotic stood the same thing same process to what the fuck was that action science. Oh activity. Yes to philosophy. That's not that crazy Xander. You got a word or a thing. I want you to do a sephiroth. Seth sephiroth, it's the it's a famous Final Fantasy. Billy said a video game character anything. I'm an illegitimate any page at all s EPA great iro separate. Yes, I found her. So here's a page for it. It's also I think it's just like it's fun to find that one of the two percent of pages that don't lead to it. You know what I mean here sephiroth leads to fictional character. Leads the person leads to reason God this one got hurt the quality, which is the philosophy. Wow. That was good. We got there we got there. That's pretty cool. Great. So if you're high, that's crazy. Go go go go. Try it. That's it. Yeah. Yeah do it for hours. I truly could that was fascinating and honestly, if it weren't true we could just edit it and make it is very true. Oh, yeah. How do they know we didn't already?	
1	Oh, baby think about what a long thankless project go through all of them every word every person that's good so much. It's interesting.
