3	okay, so chapter 16 of Genesis had me kind of laughing because it it reminds me of just how we are as wives sometimes but this chapter is so rich in just how it can relate to today and that's why I love the Bible man because there is like if you you just read through just to get through right to just like check it off your list. Then you are missing you are missing some good stories on you are missing some good lessons. And and so let's dig in. Okay chapter 16 is the birth of Ishmael Ishmael. You know what I'm just gonna apologize beforehand for how I pronounce some of these names, but basically it's the birth of Who comes from sarai's servant? So Abram who later is named Abraham and Sarai who's later named Sarah. So Abram and Sarai have been told by God in earlier chapters. Well Abram has been told that he's going to be a father of a bunch of Nations. Right but they are very old and Sarai decides to take matters into Her own hands because she is so old and wants to have a baby that she gives hag are her servant to Abram. Now when I first read this or like when I've heard about this in the past, I was always like how scandalous like that was. Okay, you know because it doesn't really condemn them in the Bible. It's not like God comes down and it's like how dare you sleep with another woman when you're married Abram, right? Like but here's the thing like it's not right. It's not right. It God does not say that that is okay. But Sarai gives her servant to her husband, which was not uncommon back in that day and It was actually a common practice of that day. If a married woman could not have children. She would have like a substitute wife. So one of her servants have a child with their husband to produce heirs in Abram and Sarai we know had wealth right livestock and land and all of that. So and I believe it's in a previous chapter of Genesis that Abrams like I have no errors like my servants gonna inherit it or my servants kid. You know, whatever. So let's that's like an overview right but this is so rich in lessons. Let's get into it. So Genesis 16 starts with now Sarai Abrams wife had not been able to Bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. So sir. I said to Abram the Lord has prevented me from having children go and sleep with my servant perhaps I can have children through her and Abram agreed with surprise proposal. So Sarai Abrams wife. Took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. This happened Ten Years After Abram had set settled in the land of Canaan. So we all know what happened right Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant, but when hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt. So let's back up though really quick to Abram going and sleeping with Hagar. Abram was acting in line with the custom of the day. Right? So it was common for that to happen. But his action showed a lack of faith that God would fulfill his promise. So what are something this is like the question that I asked myself what are some things that are acceptable today by the world, right? What are some things that are in line with the custom of today?	
1	that	
3	Is exposing my weak Faith or my unfaithfulness or my Disobedience to God like what are some worldly customs of today that we kind of like in the Bible?	
1	It's not right or it it shows our lack of faith.	
3	It's Disobedience, but we justify it by saying Well, everybody's doing it we justify it by saying well, you know like Like I mean the the common practice of today like it's okay nowadays, right? That's why it's so important to filter like how we think and the things we say and what we do Through the Bible.	
1	So I want you to ask yourself that what are some customs of today.	
3	What are some things that are acceptable today by the world that is So beating it to God or that's exposing like are weak faith in God, right? Because sir, I in chapter 16 verse 3 sir. I took matters into her own hands by giving hag are to her husband Abraham, right her weak faith in God. She said God has prevented me from having children. She had trouble believing God's promise like Abraham in chapter 12, right, which says let's go back to chapter 12. God said God. I mean God told him that are I'm sorry. No in chapter 12 when he goes to Egypt and is like look you are a very beautiful woman. He says this to Sarai when the Egyptian see you they will say this is his wife. Let's kill him. And we can have her so please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life in treat me well because of their interest in you. So here's the thing Abraham's lack of faith that God would protect him. He took matters into his own hands write and tell Sarah to act as his sister and it creates all these problems while they're in Egypt same thing with Sarah when she took matters into her own hands because she had trouble believing God's promise out of this lack of Faith came a series of problems now. I want you to think of our your life or I'm thinking of my life right now how this happens when we take over for God right trying to make his promises come true through efforts that are not in line with his specific directions. Sometimes God gives us a promise. Sometimes we hear God calling us like, okay like	
1	Cheers Cheers this big promise I have for your life. Right and we're like, oh my gosh, like how am I supposed to do that? Sometimes?	
3	I know that I have tried to handle all the details. But sometimes God is just calling us to be obedient in just taking a step of Faith out. Right and we most of the time we don't understand how God's plan or his. Promise is going to work out but we need only to be obedient to what he's calling us to like that first step right not having to have it all figured out anxiety stress overwhelm. This all comes like in our life. I know in my life when I try to take when I try to figure out all the details right like when I try to be in control of everything or Get super impatient while waiting for God. In in in when Waiting for God period right like I know that I can become very impatient. Like if I'm like, okay. Yeah. God is definitely calling me to this like let's make it all happen overnight. All right, like I am so impatient. Oh man, but it says Be Still In know I am God. So this is actually in Proverbs or in Psalms. I'm sorry.	
1	This is in Psalms chapter 46.	
3	I believe be still and know I am God, right? We just we just talked about this in church recently and being still is not like idle rest, right? It's not like okay just lay down and do nothing. It's a command that it and it's like a cease of worry, right?	
1	It to be still is a choice with action not idle rest.	
3	So in order to find security in God, you need to stop finding Security in everything else right and worrying about everything else will how is this going to happen? How did it end like stop wrestling against God and let him show you who he is right in chapter 15 Abraham and Abraham believed the Lord and the Lord counted him righteous because Of his faith not by his Good Deeds, but by his belief in who God is and and that he would be faith that God would be faithful in his promise right not worrying about the details of when just acting in obedience and being faithful to God when we ask God for something and have to wait we can be tempted to take matters into our own hands and then it interferes with God's plans. Right? Like I know for sure and I call this like a detour Because I opened a studio when I knew I rushed into it. God was not calling me to that at all II like instantly had anxiety. I was stressed like in those things do not come from the Lord right? But this was early in my faith when I did man when I was just striving for achievements and I thought I had to earn God's love. I thought I had to like like accomplish things in order to earn his Van earned his blessings, right? I took matters into my own hands all the time all the time. I wasn't allowing myself to be still it because I really didn't truly know who God was because I wasn't in in deep relationship with him because I was trying to be in control of everything.	
1	so chapter 16 verse 5.	
3	Okay. Let's get back. Let's get back to this. It says sir. I said to Abe. Okay. So let's so Abram had sexual relations with Hagar. This is a verse for so Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant but when a hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt, right? So she was shoot. I'm sure hag are was like, oh I was able to have a baby and you're not ha ha ha right then sir. I said to Abram this is all your fault. I My servant into your arms, but now that she's pregnant. She treats me with contempt the Lord will show who's wronged you or me. Oh my gosh. Okay. So this is typical like for me. This is typical me and my husband right? I'm going to tell you the story and I really don't like to admit this but um this ornament from my son who's 10 years old now, I have this ornament that I treasure with	
1	Like all of my heart because it is his hand print from when he was like 2010.	
3	So he was like a year and a half old. She was born into June 2009. Okay, it's this handprint and there's like Little Snowmen and oh my gosh, it's a glass ornament is my favorite ornament because it can't be replaced. Right? So I like I double box it when I put it away and I store it and when I take it out, I put it high up on the tree. So none of my other kids can touch it. Like I love this ornament it if it breaks All Is Lost right? So I finally took down the tree after New Year, but I first took all the ornaments off because I really just wanted to get the tree like out so I took the ornaments off I put him in a little pile. I took the tree down. I like swept and stuff and all of a sudden it was like boom. My Deegan was awake. My two-year-old like things got crazy. My husband came home. Home at the same time and I had to go take a meal to a friend because she had just had a baby that was in the hospital. All right, whatever. So I'm like, oh my gosh, babe. I have to go take this meal. And so while you're watching football, can you just like start putting away those ornaments boom? I was out right? I should have put away and I the first thing I thought to was like you should probably put that ornament away ever, but I was like nah, that's fine. Right dumb because my two-year-old and a four-year-old were up. Round I should have known I should have known and I was like the Lord told me you need to put that ornament away, right? But I didn't so I came home and Lord.	
1	What do I see when I first walk in the door Aubrey's like looking at the floor and I'm like what happened and I see glass shattered and I'm like, oh my gosh, that's my ornament and sure enough.	
3	It was Riley's ornament from when he was a year. Year and a half with his handprint. I don't have anything else with his handprint on it from that time and it is is broken and I'm like, oh my gosh, and of course, I turned to my husband and I'm like, why did you not put these ornaments? Hopefully, I like totally blanked him right for these ornaments and he's like if like really like you should have put you should have put it away. Like if it was that important to you, right and oh my God, let me tell you girl like I'm a Christian. But I like the south side of the Kingdom came out at me. I got so upset and I got a little hood on him.	
1	Right?	
3	I hadn't realized my husband looked at me and he was like, oh man. I have not seen this side of you in quite a while right could anyway, so here's the thing though, right? It is often easier to strike out in frustration and accuse someone else than to admit. MIT an error and ask for forgiveness like in this is kind of what sir, I did to write like she arranged for Abram to take hag are and and was like give me a baby in the husband's like well, okay, like like whatever you want, right? Um, but then she's angry about it.	
1	And even though Abram also should have stopped and said something right? Like like sir, I should have taken should have admitted to the air and asked for forgiveness.	
3	But man we've been playing the blame game since the beginning right Adam and Eve they both eat the forbidden fruit and God asked Adam about it. And he's like, well this woman you gave me told me to eat it, right and then he's like, well this serpent told me to eat it, right I mean It is so much easier to blame other people or to play victim really right and knew that victim word is like dang know like none of us want to admit it. But we do and that is just us as humans, right? That's why we have to go to God and a girl. Let me tell you when I was like, I mean I got upset at my husband, but also the Holy Spirit told me like Eva.	
1	This is not like this is something you need to give to me, right? I needed to ask my husband to forgive me for for how I was acting it was my fault. I could have put the ornament away whatever there was no reason to be angry and it actually put a wedge in the night for my husband.	
3	And I you know, here's the thing about anger to is. Anger, especially when it arises from one of our own mistakes. It can be dangerous. Right because hag are was so sir. I was so mean took it out on she was angry with Abram, but she took it out on hag are and cause hag are to run away.	
1	And so these three people that we see here in this in Genesis right?	
3	Three people who made serious mistakes sir. I who took matters into her own hands and gave her servant to Abram Abram who went along with the plan but when circumstances began to go wrong, he refused to help solve the problem, right? Because I believe he says he says well, she's your servant like deal with her as You want you know and then you have Hagar who ran away from the problem, but in spite of this messy situation that all three of these people get themselves in God demonstrates his ability to work in all things for good right Romans 8:28. That is that that is like one of my favorite. I think that's a lot of people's favorite verse.	
1	Let's see. I don't want to I don't want to miss it. Miss say it because it's so good. Romans 8:28 I'm flipping there now. So if you want you can flip their to or not. Just listen and we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. And so we know definitely that God had a purpose for Abraham Abraham whose Abram at this point answer I write that all that the nation. Be blessed through them and so regardless or despite the fact that Sarai and Abram took things into their own hands because they were impatient on God's promise on God's time. He still made it work for his good for the purpose of of his plan right for his purpose of Abram and Sarai. So sir, Ian Abrams still received the sun.	
3	They so desperately wanted and God solved Hagar's problem. Despite Abrams refusal to get involved.	
1	Right? No problem is too complicated for God if you're willing to let him help. But that's it's so hard to admit our wrongs especially when were angry or were sitting waiting for a promise from God and we're just were anxious or feeling overwhelmed. I mean, I know I get so antsy in the waiting period but that's when we start to take take things into our own hands.	
3	We miss those opportunities to grow in Relationship with God to grow in our faith, right?	
1	I think we ask God for so many things that sound like good ideas, but then we have the opportunity to practice those things. A lot of us are like, oh heck no like not right now next time right? I know that when I was really upset with my husband with that ornament. I was like Lord I do not Lord, I do not want to admit my wrong my pride right?	
3	Oh man, there it is like my pride and I even my word for 2020 is available available to serve available to love available to be kind available to do whatever God's calling me to write and I knew that it was that I was being a brat that I was taking my anger out on my husband and I was blaming him when really I just needed to	
1	Suck it up and admit and I made a bad choice.	
3	Right and I need to and I'm going to suffer the consequences of my of my bad choice, but instead it is it's so much easier to vent our frustrations in our anger and try to place it on somebody else. So at the end of the night, I went upstairs and I looked at my husband and I was like I don't even think I said anything we both started laughing and I was like, you know, I'm Kat I've been asking the Lord to soften my heart about this to forgive me. I was like, it's so hard. You know what I told him. I was like, I really don't want to be nice to you right now. And that's when we started laughing because I knew that it was even though I could not replace this or an imminent, right?	
1	The Lord was telling me you are still blessed with these three kids like it is it's an ornament. It's a thing you have your children. You have your husband like it.	
3	It'll it's okay, right, but I still learned a lesson in that now if I would have instead in been in raged right in let that take over. And I wasn't willing to just sit with myself because I literally sat down stairs. I washed the dishes.	
1	I put some praise and worship music on and I just sat myself I was singing and I was just spending time in God's presence for giving my husband and my heart truly truly and just being honest with myself and honest with God and you know, I just maybe there's some	
3	he has or maybe there is something that has happened that you need to let go and forgive. I I don't know.	
1	I don't know but I hope that you're able to take some time to be honest with yourself. Be patient with how God is working in your life. And remember that if you allow God to work in your life he can he has the ability. To work in all things for good for those who love him. Right. Allow God to work in your life. Give him the space to work in your life. My prayer is that. we can all be honest with ourself surrender these frustrations surrender our control give it all to God and that he will encourage us to step in obedience even in the smallest things. I hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I am. I'll talk to you guys soon. Peace out.
