2	Do you want the long story or the shortest one? Let's do the long. Let's go long. All right, so well, As you all know.	
1	I'm I'm a Christian. So my faith right? It's it's Christian and yeah, it's way way back when I was young.	
2	I was introduced into it by my uncle.	
1	So I have one a we have a pastor who based here back then that's back in 2013. And yeah.	
2	This man to it. So here is what yeah here. Yeah once a week we will have a small group like young men's group all young man's young couples group and we're just gonna talk about live we're going to do we're going to we're going to discuss some modules.	
1	We're going to do some question and answer Q Benes stuff like that. Just just to make us grow like, so one time we we are talking about how we can take care of our physical. Yeah or of our physical body so and Crossfit back then was getting popular like 2013. That's where the sports became really big. Oh, those are dirty. Yeah. Yeah. Our church is really Pro into that. So it's not like spiritually, but of course mentally and physically there really are Moving the forward towards that direction. So CrossFit was really introduced to us by our church. Finally started. Right? Look I did not expect this.	
2	Okay, so and where did you start? So we're talking about it in one of the small groups and he asked me.	
1	Hey, maybe do you want to join me? Sometimes like so I was the first one in the group to join him. Join our posture and yet the join him in a group in a workout. So and do you remember I said, yes.	
2	Yeah. I said yes.	
1	We went to his box one of the famous boxing Amsterdam and right from the start. I was really hooked up man. My first workout was I was really I do not know it exactly but it's a amrap. And it involves a box jump. Okay.	
2	It's like I've never jump I never did any plyo exercises before so it's really scary, but it's fun at the same time and I was really hook about it.	
1	So how's your sport background or do you do any sports before?	
2	Well when I was still in school, I used to play basketball, but not really a varsity level is like pickup game stuff.	
1	that I always into that and then when I groove into my adolescent age	
2	started going to a global Gene because of my brother. Yeah, he dragged me into this.	
1	So he started first doing bodybuilding stuff like isolation into regular gym and his told me a come with me you train so because we were once in a theater, we were once teammate in a small competition basketball here in Amsterdam. So, yeah. We kind of he kind of trained for that. So he dragged me into it. Let's begin strong. Like how often do you goes?	
2	It's pretty good.	
1	At first we were just at first I joined him at least twice three times a week first doing so some clock Global team some isolation exercises isolation, and they will start first with Running 15 minutes on the treadmill then do some visor to do some bench squat that it's a funny story.	
2	Right? So I've done that for three to four years didn't get any results.	
1	Unfortunately. It was the lifestyle next to it.	
2	My lifestyle was just drinking and smoking next to that even though and I became Christian that didn't when Way that fast so and I was keep smoking and drinking while playing basketball like my conditioning is hello. Yeah, my range of motion is messed up because all of the contraction well exercises.	
1	So yeah, where are we so I got introduced to cuspid.	
2	I tried it once I hooked up that I signed up right from the start.	
1	All right, awesome. And you started to go right from the start like three four. Times a week. Wow. Yeah at first yeah, my pastor always pick me up or I pick him up and we're just going to go carpool because it's in Amsterdam. It's too far and yes try to doing three times a week. But of course, I want to go more. It was Ruiz just its role addictive, but I can because first the distance and of course we took to gasoline is high that time.	
2	So I bought a scooter absurd am how long was the drive it is 40 minutes 40 minutes. You could get it by 30, but you're not going to stop it and stops it stopped. So just riding the red line. I remember I remember the guys on our small group start doing it as well. So who cook? Sigmund and Randall nodes up for a free trial session into the box where I restraining while Sigmund Kip kept doing it. So he signed up right away after he his first free trial but no way notes Randall. I don't know. He's just not into it yet.	
1	But now he's a member of our Box O and your brother good God.	
2	He's yeah, he's started a couple of months later. Later in the other box one box in hard time.	
1	So yeah, and how long have you been going there to Armstrong well-trained therefore more than almost a year so Matt, my first year of experience in CrossFit was really terrible because always get knee pain or had a serious back injury. It's like spasms that's real. Man, it's hard. It's almost 2 months that I couldn't live a bar. Also reason.	
2	Well, there was one of the workouts that we need to do a heavy deadlifts and the next day we need to do a heavy back squat. And of course, my form is really sucks and I wanted so bad. So yeah that happens guys. If you do not train smart that eventually will happen so Yeah, I thought to myself it's this is not the way to do it.	
1	So. I need to do something I need to do something right so I ran I had the opportunity to go to the states to rest Rascals were so that that's where Prospect started had the opportunity to go there because of our church Community like they say they're there they were they're having a conventional camp for young adults back there that I was talking about 2014, but how long can the month they think five weeks by Manhattan weeks.	
2	So when they're talk to my pastor, I'm going to I'm going to come there. I went there with Sigma.	
1	So I was a week ahead of him and then he followed then so my goal there as well.	
2	of course going to that conventional thing conventional camp	
1	I was I want to look into the boxes right feel the feel how they really do it feel how they really train. What's really crossed with looks like because in my feeling CrossFit in Europe, it's still young still. Yeah. So the first CrossFit here in Holland is way back in 2009 and the 2009-2010. So it's just really a young Sports back then so	
2	Yeah, I did that. I trained in one of the top boxes in San Francisco San Francisco respite for a month. And yeah, it's really impressive. It's really expensive like almost 300 euros dollars a month in the 2014 North 2014. So yeah, we're lucky here Europe. How was your experience? What was different?	
1	And well, the first thing I really noticed is the intensity of the workouts like in every segment. There's a stimulus that they really explain and that they really hammer it down to you in coaching itself as well.	
2	So what I get what I was used to here in Holland was really all out 40 minutes amrap or for time with heavy load every single day that	
1	Heavier bar right more heavy on heavy and intense workout.	
2	And yeah, eventually you're going to feel it. Mainly if you do not have the skill to recover.	
1	If you do not have the right technique you're going to eventually pick something up and yeah break your body eventually, right? So that's the first thing I've noticed there's like how they segmented the skill.	
2	Part because in one of those boxes and Sample service crafted they have the mobility class. They have gymnastic course a class or if they have a weightlifting class all segmented out.	
1	All right. Yeah, and they can really focus on the skills and slow down.	
2	So that's what happened.	
1	There's	
2	And yeah, even with the other boxes that I have checked in La check couple of boxes there.	
1	The thing the thing there is like the really are honing the skill first right prioritizing the movements before the intensity. So that's the first thing that I really learn going there. And how was the atmosphere there? Well, yeah, it's because well, I thought that Community feeling mostly in San Francisco because that there's where I spend the most time. Okay.	
2	So gotten all the people in La it's a little bit Hollywood its type. So when they took up their shirts there you'll really like looks like a model like intimidating. I was taking off my shirt back here. I'm not even that Behave, but I didn't dare to think it took my shirt off. But in any way it's more glamour. It's a little bit. Yeah. It's like I don't know. It's Hollywood. You know, you get what I'm talking about? Yeah. So after I went back, I applied it. So I'm my our pastor was relocated in La so there's no sense to go to Amsterdam anymore.	
1	So, where did you go? So I've moved to one of the boxes in Harlem and then my brother and BJ followed me there. So let's	
2	You try to get an internship. Yeah, at first I tried to get an internship there, right? So I don't know why because maybe you my goal here is to train more in the open gyms. So, of course, if you're in turn you're going to get the key and you could use the gym, but it was not so you are not focus on coaching yet. No, not yet. Not yet. So I tried it a couple of times. But due to my my schedule at work, I have two shifts. So I cannot cover all the ships that they are asking for me.	
1	So they said yeah, it's not really going to work for us.	
2	And I think it's because I didn't have the the skill yet to coach back then right and they did it really have any system on how to have.	
1	Yeah, okay.	
2	So just so you didn't go to did it go both ways. But of course my priority priority back then is not the coach but to compete to have more time to train right? So what I did, okay, I just signed I just signed up myself there to be a member and I bought a set of blades and a mans bar the train. At home. So now home days. There's a back storage. I emptied it up. I throw everything that I that we do not use I bought 18 mats. And of course the the first my first bar is the one without a bearing the VN 1 right, so weird one. No, but it's still in the box so you can see it see it in the Box. Yeah, so I bought that I bought it in Amsterdam. I still remember the day that I bought it's like and then I bought the set of plates together with brother.	
1	We got it in almere has like a 45-minute drive and it's not even that cheap.	
2	But back, then it's really hard to get and Equipment because it because this point was he angry or just starting you can just get a go online and buy it online that it's really hard or you're gonna import it into States or into the other countries, which is more expensive if we get everyday real ship that right. So you started to train at home how to train at home was very happy. Not really not really right once I got my first bearing bar. That's the again faster. I bought it online from UK. So this is really expensive because I really want to drop the bar. I don't know what well then the problem with the neighbors games like every time I do it at that even doing it after six just in the morning, but of course Every time I drop the bar the floor is shaking. So, you know, you know how it goes and the house is here in Holland the really too close to each other. It's like after you fart the neighbors could hear it. That's how close it is. So yeah try to minimize that and control all my movements. So it's not really that fun. So I tried to kept going more often to open gyms up into the Says and box that were trained off.	
1	From time to time. Okay, and you are still like in the training for yourself improving yourself more worrying than athlete. Yeah, when the switch from being an athlete to starving to coach when it happened why it happened.	
2	Yeah as I Kept doing that training at home invited a couple of friends like Sigma BJ my brother to train with me as well as like it's more fun.	
1	It can do it with together.	
2	Yeah. All right, let's so back then. I kind of know if this I have that passions like well, I can't explain the movements right and back dead before I got my in Before I tried to get my internship after I move after I went to States. I got my L1 certification just just just for myself.	
1	It's not really to open up a business, but just for myself just to get the knowledge to get the knowledge get the right movement.	
2	I thought but of course L1. Yeah, they will teach you how to move but of course this that's a two to three day class.	
1	And it's the basics. It's the basics, right? So I kept reading books about movement about training how to train about nutrition and eventually I kind of have a lifestyle that happens. I'm doing like eating clean working out the smoking stop.	
2	Yeah right from the start the moment.	
1	They start CrossFit like I go turkey myself stop smoking but back. I'm still drinking but the drinking a eventually Fades away as my daughter grow old.	
2	So yeah, so I'm straining with the guys and of course I want to involve my wife as well. So from time to time and train with her bought a pair of kettlebells bought a pair of dumbbells, but a pair of rings so I wasn't yeah. It's that bad made up my own plyo box at home. If you check out my Instagram my you will still see the plyo box that I made and it's really scary because as you jump at the top it's really wobbled really you so and yeah while training my wife my wife have a good friend of hers who wants to train as well who have a difficult time losing weight.	
1	She's old. Wait and having hard time to move. So what we did. Yeah, I asked her it maybe want to train with us.	
2	I could practice my coaching itself and Yeah, just just just let's see how we how I can help her. All right, so that's really my first kind.	
1	Yeah, first experience giving a class or giving a writing a workout and executing it in a class setting and this is still at your home in your backyard.	
2	Yeah. It's still happening at my home back then it was 2014 Summers like from	
1	May from March.	
2	Yeah, that's the one that's the one March all the way till September October.	
1	You can still train outside actually, so we did that and eventually I see the progress in her beginning hit she couldn't do a one purpose.	
2	What's the time? That's the alarm?	
1	Because it's not fine but kids but as we go on to this programs like we were training once or twice a week at home. Okay? Yes, like we pick up Tuesdays and Thursdays something like that.	
2	And that's where we really get into the coaching. Yeah, so as I see her progressing like In the mans weeks that pass by she could do pull-ups. She could do a burpee. She could do a ring Rose now. She's not catching her breath as we do during the workouts, right? I even thought I even gave some basic lifting weight lifting exercise like power cleans and push press like that.	
1	So she's really improving and yeah, when I saw that like there's something and something in me that this is because back then I was still searching for its did it.	
2	Is that what I'm going to do and why will be just a warehouse worker and you know, well, I just go to the work working two shifts and go home clean my garden, right? So I was slowly having that thought in me as we move on. Where did it come from? It comes from our community our church Community who giving us Visions like that's really important that you have that community that will guide you through it.	
1	So yeah, right. So that's where it started like.	
2	I think I already found it, but I'm not saying it yet to my wife started.	
1	It's gonna be yeah if we're going to start this. We're going to cut it. So what I did is I approached my pastor and I told him this is before Indians. He leaves and migrated to States. Yeah, we want to open up a small group that we just work out once a week in our congregation. So that's where it really started. So and then you know, they first class.	
2	Yeah, so Rent a place a small place where you could play basketball and we bought a set of kettlebells, you know, the the plastic kettlebells that we have.	
1	That's our first set of kettlebells the orange the blue one and the bigger the big Catalyst. Okay and your kids doing these classes once a week for yeah, okay, and when the idea of opening a box well	
2	It's getting there. It's like a really want to keep doing this.	
1	So I told to my wife. Hey, how is it hard is it it's really hard to just open up a box because my idea there's like I could have my own place to train because it still looks like yeah, I'm just training two hours a day is like, yeah, it's gonna be much easier if I could have my own place to pay and not travel.	
2	More too far and we could have a business but what was her reaction?	
1	Well at first, of course, she she she has her doubts, but my wife always supports me in any decision that I made she's always at my back and that's why I love her for that. So I got my level one actually if we want we could open up the box.	
2	But where do we get we're going to get the for the the the financials the financial stuff, right?	
1	So yeah, that's what happened and early summer or early quarter of 2015 all the way up to October.	
2	So what we did is I got my wet weight lifting course.	
1	Okay, so you can't like yeah my certificate so I told to do Though her to he has if we're going to do this we need more. We need more words, like need more knowledge into it giving a class. It's for me.	
2	So we got the weightlifting class and the level 2 and that helped me the most right but the level 2.	
1	I got it already at the end of the year. So I already giving a class we already so when you when you opened then yeah.	
2	Let me know afterwards you get to level two.	
1	So to hone my skills much more and you opened the first location in October 2015, right? Yeah, that that's that. That's where we got the keys and officially we open up our doors November 1st 1st, 2015 16. Okay, so we'll celebrate for years.	
2	Yeah. It's almost four years. I've always celebrated. With Halloween party, I don't know. What are we going to do this year, but be sure to come make sure you've got here is our box. So any opened in a different location right in the North and then in the old industrial place, so the process looks like this we because back then I was working two shifts. So as my manager if I could just	
1	In one chip so we could open in the afternoon like give to class in the afternoon and open gym so I could train.	
2	Yes. He'll die. So next the financial right? I got that going. So we move on to the next step Financial play over we're gonna get financially, how are we going to finance this stuff?	
1	Like we calculated the things that they need the places that we need to rent how much?	
2	How big was the stuff came after 30 grams of 30,000 euros? That's our and we went to the BOK to the bank bank to bank with our business proposal. And of course Very, they will say no no way no experience of any kind of business not have enough money in the bank savings, right? Yeah, so they just said no. But one of the bank the olders you could really get it more easier.	
1	If you're going to personally knowing that that money. Okay, right.	
2	And of course the Rand is a little bit higher but it's not that it's not that high back then the red is a bit smaller.	
1	Yeah for personal loans, right?	
2	So what we did is yeah, we did that went up to our Own bank and we we ask for a personal loan. So we got that the first equipment. No, not yet. Well you need to affiliate first. But before you get affiliate, you need to present a location and etc etc.	
1	Right.	
2	So and the name you have to keep getting a location is hard because you need to do to to have a certain certificates and certain license like the parking lights as outside. The noise it need to be certificated. So that's what the first thing. We did we find a place and we talked to the the broker and yeah, we filed a petition for certification for Sports on that building.	
1	So as we get that then we could move on to affiliate fleeting.	
2	So I emailed my story to CrossFit age. HQ and then Yeah, they give us a go sign giving us asking us for what will be the name of your box. So send us five names that you think of and back then I don't have any clue. It's like what will be the right thing. So but back then in every move that we made I was really really close to our one of our overseeing pastor who's based in LA, right?	
1	So, yeah. Yeah, we're asking her.	
2	Yeah, what will be the name of the Box because that will represent us.	
1	All right. So yeah, you go to our now.	
2	We had a couple of names. I don't know anymore.	
1	Right but we really have almost a two months of forth and back emails and hundreds of names.	
2	Like I'm I'm I guess I'm headed to names and then Use or it sounds familiar than the with the other back so they won't allow that to use it. I think if the name is cool, they would keep it from this stuff and then we'll just say you cannot use that name because it's really freaking hard just like every time I've came up come up with the name. I'll going to search it there if it's already taken and it's all always.	
1	Taken crazy. So one time as I told our church Community is into fitness and back then they have the move what you called iron feet right iron feet and that name came from a scripture in Bible like iron sharpens iron. So one man sharpens another right and that's where really there.	
2	That's where it really	
1	Came from our names like about that Community about being together. We need gold to each other. Yeah, right and the well, that's our motto as well as like That's what I want to bring here is to bring a positive positive thing to our members lives like right and help each other in any positive way. Yeah, so iron sharpens iron and some days. I don't like have man sharpens another right? So luckily I've got not rejected.	
2	No. Luckily. We got we got it. And yeah the name sounds cool.	
1	So yeah, that's where everybody plays CrossFit comes from.	
2	And I'm really I think yeah. I know I know for sure.	
1	That's what that's what we're doing right now and I'm really happened. It's really hard to open up a box because man.	
2	If you want to get rich don't open up a gym. That's my first that's my first yeah advice to you guys. If you're if you're planning to open up a gym don't do it.	
1	Okay, so you got the name you got the all the licenses and we first of November you opened the gates. Yeah in the other location and you stayed there for a year, right?	
2	Yeah. We stayed there for a year. I know it's just going to be a stepping stone.	
1	Stone so we just got the lease for a year.	
2	It's a small and its really small is like not even the half of this what we're in right now is like 90 square meters with the with the with the with the toilet and changing of the aisle. There's no if there's not no not even a changing room magnet. Yeah. I think you're not gonna sign up to us. So we started In our community are majority of our members are back then are our church members.	
1	That's good. That's that's and it really helped me a lot to to hone my skills and they are really forgiving right, but I know I need more so I keep studying keep mimicking the greatest coach there is and then I went to L2 it opened up my eyes from some. I'm more and it's really just trying and error. It's like you could never really have one good shot even up to today like always make mistakes. Like I always ask myself. How did the classroom? Oh, I should have done that much better. I should have do this to make it more safer stuff like that, right and keep learning Active Learning. So and then after a year I moved here to this. Goin Fishin afternoon. Yeah after a year were right around 40 members. It says yeah, if you really want to do this we're just going to do it right get a good place that you could feed enough people and to and have more room to grow so we found this place and yeah we moved here in 2016 October exactly what over 15 we got the Kia Soul.	
2	Well, I don't know. What would that number and we have week of moving out moving our stuff out back. Then we do the thumb much stuff. So everything is removed within a day. We believe it or not and we bought some floorings. I have a just built it up together with the couple of members.	
1	We set up the rig and it's really fun because you could really see that there's there there's a culture there's a community of Helping each other in any kind of situation like and I like it's like yeah, that's what you want to build here. Yeah, right that thing is like yeah, it's more than a money I suppose. Yeah, and since then they are gradually growing and building more people's outside more equipment equipment and we we keep making ourselves better service wise right facility wise. So this coming season we will have some changes in the Box make sure you watch out for that. It's in the making I'm really excited that the way yeah me too. Right it's going to be more so and what's the what's the goal?	
2	Well, I go or not our goal our goal now, is that as we move on Of course, of course if I could provide to my family I could go full time here.	
1	So that's of course my first my one of my major goals is to go full-time first person Focus. Yeah what we're doing we could open up more ours right?	
2	So I hired you last May.	
1	End of May to help me out here coaching and so far.
