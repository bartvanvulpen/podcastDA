1	Peace.	
2	Welcome to the Daily shroom today. We're here with Johnny Pena. He was an ex narc a part of the K-9 unit and he was a deputy in San Jose California, but now he's a stand-up comedian. Oh, and he currently micro doses with psilocybin. Is there anything else you like to introduce yourself with? Johnny?	
1	No, I think that pretty much covers it. Yeah, I worked, you know as a narcotic age and I worked as a detective K9 which is a deputy sheriff and then that came to an end in 2013 and then I got into the world of tech. Look for a tech company now and then what type of that? Google I work for Google. Yeah.	
2	Oh, wow.	
1	Are you from from leaving 2013 to being a part of Google that's a little different, you know going from a very conservative type of field of work right working in law enforcement to working for a very liberal Progressive. I mean, I liked it. It was just it was it took it took a while to get used to, you know, I ended up in HR a lot. Because I frequently say what I what I'm thinking it just comes out and so you have to really be careful when you work in a in a in this type of environment because it can be deemed as you know being aggressive or or confrontational when really you're just expressing yourself, but I've learned to just keep my mouth shut and you know express myself in the gym.	
2	I said you think psychedelics help with that too. two	
1	You know that so, you know part of my issue is that I have post-traumatic stress syndrome. Yeah, I was involved in a shooting in 2005 and then when I was a deputy sheriff or also Deputy Corners, which means you deal with all the dead bodies that involve that includes kids, you know teenagers giving notice to parents and middle of the night to let them know that their kids are dead because of a car accident or or whatever it was, you know, just a lot of like traumatic stuff, you know, cry. I'm scenes murder-suicide crime scenes. We had a crime scene of like this mom, who was she had some mental disabilities and then she added up shooting her infant daughter. That was my crime scene. I to deal with it. And so after years of, you know a decade of just kind of push that stuff down and you don't you don't kind of let it bother you because if you let it you know fester and or if you just let it you know, come out the job will eat you alive like you literally start To like break down and you can't have that happen because you got to go right back to work again. You got to do it again the next day so you just kind of push it away and deal with it later or just don't deal with it and you know just drink drink it through it later, you know go to the bar and and have some beers. So quite frequently. Yes. I'm quite frankly. What ends up happening. Is that while you're dealing with these issues on the back end, you know on the front end you develop a dependency whether it's on alcohol or it's on and By depressants or it's on you know some other way it has to come out some other way for meals alcohol and then I'm just a very a-type personality. I'm very All or Nothing so, you know, I do a lot of working out I do a lot of like kickboxing and stuff like that. So I have to express myself in other ways. But the problem was that the alcohol kind of took over the healthy way. So I started drinking too much which eventually ended up costing me the job. So, you know once I left law enforcement, I still had all these issues I had to deal with you know, I had a deal with somebody dying because I got in the shooting and that always kind of bothered me and to deal with all these things that I had seen. So when I left I went back to started smoking marijuana again trying to curb that right got my medical card and it did help it did help at night. You know, I kind of just crash out. Out without having any dreams or anything like that.	
2	Yeah, man smoke weed everyday. It helps me with my PTSD and things like that.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's great. But then there's that there has to be something that shuts off the images and the voices and stuff like period you know, and so when you go to the doctor, the first thing they want to do is they want to put you on sometimes I was like antidepressant or anti-anxiety or something like that, you know, because I have social anxiety. I don't like being And large crowds it makes me paranoid and so I got tired of like basically being a prisoner in my own house without I want to go do social stuff because I'm always worried that something's going to happen. I do I would worry that the people that I've sent to prison we're going to come out and maybe like come back afternoon lecture me because I put people in prison for you don't have to rely for even a lifetime sentence or 10 years this replaces that big the community is not that big they're going to run into me. It's all I was thinking like man. I'm going to running these people and so it would it would make me paranoid anywhere in Newark in San Jose.	
2	Right?	
1	I was in Mark 4 Department of Justice. So all throughout California. Okay. Yeah, and I mainly dealt with like methamphetamine trafficking that was like my that was my area of expertise cartel stuff methamphetamine trafficking in manufacturing and then anything related to games that was kind of that was like my Niche.	
2	Yeah. Big thing like arresting people for acid those type of things in the 10 years.	
1	That I did that job. I never once arrested somebody for weed. I mean I pull people over because they were driving Halo a slow and release their respective fighting Shake on my floor. Yeah, you know and I never ever I never even cited anybody for a weed. I mean I make him throw it out or something like that. But I smoked weed is a teenager. Like I really don't care about my thing was like the hard drugs the drugs that actually I could do like damage to you. So, you know, like methamphetamine and heroin stuff like that pills, especially but as far as like LSD shrooms, you know peyote anything like that. I'd never ever dealt with anybody on it, you know ever and if I did I didn't know it, you know, I I pulled over one guy one time you had like three mushrooms in his pocket and he was like, I'm going to go to prison for this. I'm like Or that he's like I got three mushrooms in my pocket. I'm like did I don't care if you have some she's in your pocket. I'm like just go like just go home. Don't be out here in the street, you know, like go home. I never thought of it as a big deal, you know to me it didn't seem like it was somebody at mushrooms. Does it seem like a danger to the community, you know?	
2	Yeah, they're really doing much.	
1	Yeah. They're just, you know, making snow angels on the lawn, you know at a park, you know. tip so I wanted to I did a lot of reading. I did a lot of reading on the John Hopkins studies and I started reading about some of the benefits that they're starting to find out like in psychedelics has looked at the MDMA studies. I look at the ketamine studies. I looked at the psilocybin the Ayahuasca studies and it all seemed like very intriguing to me and seemed like something that maybe I was interested in but All the problem is that when you're an ex narcotics agent. Nobody wants to sell you drugs. They just don't you know, right so finding even even people. I know I'm like, hey man, you know where I can get some shrooms in like are you sure you're not a cop anymore Mike? I'm not a cop anymore. That's where so it was it was a challenge, you know, it was it was a it was a challenge. So I	
2	so now you microdose.	
1	Yeah. So so what I ended up doing was I ended up just buying spores, you know, and and and then the grow kit and I just I grew my own and then I bought a dehydrator and I dehydrated them and then I just kind of like read a book was my crew those he was I listen to some podcasts with Paul Stanley it and and you know, I'm like trying to judge it. I the way I figured like for me, I'm a pretty I'm a pretty big guy. Also, I did the first time I did it I did it I think about maybe a quarter of a teaspoon of powder. I put in a coffee grinder and I just put it in my water and drink it and you can't really you don't really notice it too much. You know, my day seemed a little bit brighter. I was in a better mood I went to work and you know everything seemed okay. I didn't know. This that I could focus a little bit better on my work less Day Dreaming and thinking and so I did that for about I think about a week where I stay I did that and then little I started to notice little things. I'm a habitual nail-biter after about a week. I quit biting my nails like I'd get out of a nervous and nervous tic, I guess so I just I stopped. And I haven't done it really sense.	
2	So I do interesting how they could do those little habit changes. So you were saying Paul stamets. He said something about he used to look at the floor and that he doesn't look at the floor.	
1	Yeah, and and also I used to look at people up and down when I meet people I looked him up and down because I'm used to that I'm scanning them up and down to see if like, maybe they have a weapon on him or something like that. I don't do it anymore. I look people in the eyes when I say Hydro, I don't feel that like things. Xiety of like what's this person's intentions or anything like that? Like now I'm just kind of seeing people for just just being generally good people like instead of thinking what's this person up to I just think like this person is pretty cool. You know, I want to talk to them more like little stuff like that. I started to notice. So I do the microdose every day five days a week and then I take Saturday and Sunday off, okay. And you know, usually I just smoke weed on those two days. But yeah, I've been doing it since I think December I've been like reducing and my kids have noticed something my kids. My daughter kind of my kids have teenage kids. My daughter pulled me aside. She was you know what it seems like you have feelings again. It seems like you're not so dead inside.	
2	That was beautiful.	
1	It's crazy, right?	
2	Like I think yeah, I was reading an article about single moms that are microdose a mean. This is a different situation, but just parenting Mike or dosing like you want to do the dishes and shit, you know, I spend more time playing with your kids.	
1	Yeah, and I know my kids I was always on drugs last I was on search warrants. I was doing all the stuff and that was my main priority. Now, my party is just hanging out with my kids like that. Sit, you know and just enjoying it and so now they hear them say like, oh you're different now. It's pretty cool. You know, and I have to say that I'm thinking and I believe that majority of that is due to microdose in the psilocybin that personality changed that ability to to allow myself to have feelings and even if they're not good ones, but to deal with it instead of pushing it aside which I've done for so long that I kind of became my habit. You know, and so now that I do is once a month, I do a hero does.	
2	Yeah, I'm a hero dose guys. I have never microdose. I always love with sing The People's experience with it.	
1	Just yeah, I did. I think I did my first hero those I think about two months ago. So no, I just did it like on a Friday. I just you know, I six grams and I didn't do nothing. I went and sat in the backyard. I put the radio on but I never actually turned it on. I just set it out there and then I just listen to the trees for about four and a half hours. So Yes, and then kind of went through all these different portals of my mind and saw different kinds periods of my life and kind of I saw it from the outside and on the very last portal was me doing comedy until I actually I was the only person in a Auditorium while I was up on stage. I was the only person in the crowd and I was listening to my own comedy. And so I was pretty judgy about it too and I changed a bunch of my jokes because of it and my comedy is changed to some people Like my jokes about better. So I think it kind of worked out, you know.	
2	Have you ever meditated?	
1	Yeah, well, I like to meditate off of doing like maybe like a gram or maybe like 2 grams, you know, nothing too crazy. I haven't tried it yet. But I think I want to try to do like a heavy either meditation or like a float tank off of a hero dose.	
2	I've heard that it definitely opens up parts of your brain that you've never used before and it makes you definitely more empathetic towards yourself and the experiences you On through. Yeah, and I ate like you said earlier that since you were next to narcotic cop, he did go through a lot of times where you know, post traumatic stress couldn't be expressed through your work you had to kind of hold that all in and I feel like now that you're out of that field you're able to go ahead and explore parts of yourself. You never even knew of before and yeah, it's a very beautiful thing definitely and we don't realize how much we holed up inside of us until we finally Let It Go, And I think that's what psychoactive plants definitely do to us.	
1	Yeah, I'm definitely less judgy. You know, I think like when you were a cop like you become judgy and very cynical of just everyday people and I'm not like that anymore. Like I generally just like like people, you know, and I want to talk to them when before I just tried to avoid people.	
2	Yeah. Those are two completely different fields being a cop and being a comedian because comedians You talked to a lot of people your I'm not going to say you're a people pleaser. But in essence that is a part of your career and you start to understand how people think a lot more.	
1	Yeah, and and so one thing I discovered on my last hero dose Adventure was that comedy is in in in one type of form is like the only true form of like telepathy because When I'm on stage and let's say I'm doing like The Improv there's 450 people in that crowd and I'm sending out a singular singular bit of information and I'm trying to get 450 people with all different types of Senses of humor, and I'm trying to get them to agree on one little thing one little moment. And the one thing they do agree on that moment. It brings one result, which is laughter. So one thing I say can bring laughter. To 450 people with all different senses of humor. That means that our minds are like connecting for just one second. Even if it is for one second and to me like what I've kind of feel now is like that's that's my energy and their energy kind of like being like, I don't know like all together and like swirling and in a bit, you know, and it's like symbiotic, you know, and to me it's like it's not mind control but it's like our minds are in sync. think you know and once I started thinking like how	
2	What was that?	
1	They say laughter is the best medicine it absolutely is and once I started thinking about it that way it made me a lot happier doing the comedy. It's like it's just about making people laugh.	
2	Yeah, that's very therapeutic to honestly.	
1	This is the best therapy I've ever done. I've gone to counseling sessions. I've gone to all these sessions to try to help myself through my PTSD the best therapy I've gotten is me going on stage and telling stories. To people and making them in a funny way, you know, I mean that that to me that's been the best and I love doing comedy micro dosing I like to do on an empty stomach. I like to do about a gram and then go hit the stage.	
2	It probably gives you the energy before it gives you that energy.	
1	It gives you that focus and then it allows my brain just to just take things in ways that maybe I wouldn't have before, you know, I think the audience yeah, I think they can feel me. I can feel my energy better. So yeah, that's that's my journey, that's very interesting. It's far as like I've never met anyone with a background like you which was so definitely I don't think there's very many people with a background like that are doing what I'm doing now, you know what I'm saying? It's a it's a bunch of cops.	
2	You're fucking spoiled out there both in New Jersey. I still gotta go see some random motherfucker you guys. Yeah, open this door.	
1	Yeah. I just go to the store on my way home from work and pick up a Hi-Fi marijuana drink from Lagunitas and then got myself a bag and some edibles, you know.	
2	Yeah like CBD ice cream.	
1	So now I just joined. I just I just joined this group called decriminalized, California. So I'm gonna jump on the movement to try to help push for the decriminalization of psilocybin for California.	
2	That's awesome. Awesome. Thanks for that.	
1	Yeah. I'm going to try to start speaking at their at their functions and stuff like that. You know, I mean, I figure I got a good story a good voice and I can throw it out there and try to push this thing even further.	
2	Definitely leaving then keep going keep doing it because there's not enough people out here to you know, support it and I feel like we really need to get not really people on the bandwagon, but we need to spread some type of awareness and get people moving and actually spreading truth instead of disinformation. Like I think all all cops should take a macro dose before they start the job like first step you take a macro those I mean, Yeah, I'll be sick.	
1	I work at Google and they have like all meditation rooms. They have all this like stuff I'm going to do they need a psilocybin room. Where would it be just take shrooms and have a meeting?	
2	Okay. Can I ask you a question? Have you ever tried LSD or any other type of psychedelics besides troops?	
1	I did I was the in high school. I haven't done it lately. I took a gel cap in high school and it was it was cool. The one thing I I did remember is that it seemed a little bit more like Speedy to me like a little bit more jittery. I don't know. It could have just been crappy LLC. I'm interested in trying to them. The hard thing is that it's it's not easy to find you know, yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.	
2	Okay, that's a step up. Yeah, that's we had a hold fucking Ayahuasca story. Yeah last podcast. He had his Ayahuasca story about he imagined himself building bricks and creating a house and it is very interesting. I've heard many experiences. It it really depends on your mindset. I feel like it since it's such a powerful psychoactive plant that you definitely need to prepare yourself through it because it's not anything you've Dance before never done it right? I've never done it personally, but I've learned how to use DMT to have very similar experiences in my dreams. So I have very very vivid dreams you have you as anybody here tried to do T. I had an almost that was because I've heard a lot. It's very short, but it's very intense. It's a lot more intense than I can't say. It's more intense than Ayahuasca, but But it's definitely in similarities like of intensity a guy that I train with a kickboxing.	
1	He recently did it. He said it was very intense, but he said it was awesome. And it only lasted like 15 minutes.	
2	Yeah, it's very short period like between 1015 but sometimes people say feels like an eternity and that they're they're so caught up in their minds that they feel like they're sitting there for hours and hours. Yeah, so it seems an illusion. Yeah. I basically it remind you that time isn't Mission that I've learned that very much from taking psychoactive plants where you're sitting there in the car on a bad trip feels like forever.	
1	I haven't had a bad trip yet. So I'm I'm I'm pretty happy right now with the only thing we found you trips. Yeah, and I try to always put myself in a positive State of Mind before I do it, you know, just so that it doesn't happen enough. I do see some stuff like last time. I saw it. Like a lot of like skulls and stuff like that.	
2	I just thought you know what sometimes you can have both in the same experience because it's kind of like that's why I called a challenging trip because like the ancient Romans would prepare for like 40 minutes to an hour of complete Bliss and then 40 minutes to an hour of Terror and frightening everything and then another hour of bliss and then like throughout the experience, you know, I prepare for both sides of it because it'll take you to extremes. Yeah, your mind is During all over the place. So you kind of have to expect it. And I feel like for new users you really have to kind of like expect the unexpected and you know, it's unusual because it's feels kind of paranormal in a sense. You know, I mean, you're seeing things you don't normally see before you're feeling a little bit of anxiety because you don't know what you're looking at, you know, I mean and that's another thing that you know, I've wanted a tap into on these trips for people high five. You know big lie babysit, you know, I mean like sitting next to them. They're like, do you see what I see? And I'm like I do in a sense, but at the same time you don't see it unless you actually take the medicine it's yourself. And yeah, but you can like smell people's intentions. Like I don't know. It's if this like you said with the telepathy kind of thing, it's almost like you just go into this heightened state of being for like those few hours.	
1	Yeah, I don't mean I definitely when I munch when I'm when I'm having like a good a good does I think definitely sent people's intentions on me. You know, I feel like I can I can I can kind of see more energy in some of its not good some of its good. You know, it's just one of those things and so it kind of tells me who I should really talk to and who I should just kind of keep a distance from yeah.	
2	Definitely makes you like prioritize things in your mind charpentier intuition. It definitely makes you see through things that you've never seen before. It's like this Veil that once was disconnecting us between each other is like eroded it's all gone. And finally you see through that Veil and now you see people for who they are and it's a it's a beautiful thing and it's a frightening thing at the same time.	
1	Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and you know the thing like like when I when I Michael does there's certain things that I just love to do. I like I like going to kick boxing and sparring on microdose. I feel like I'm just my senses are so heightened them. I'm just on point when I'm when I'm kickboxing.	
2	Would you say there's any negative effects or it's been mostly positive.	
1	I honestly haven't had a negative effect. I don't not that I could notice and not that I was anybody on his nose.	
2	I don't see it either.	
1	Honestly, the only negative thing about it is that you know, I'm running out and I gotta figure out a way to grow some more really fast.	
2	That's crazy. But I mean you would think maybe with depending on the substance maybe not so aside and maybe MDMA OSD there might be some more because it's more synthetic but I mean suicide been just it's picked out of the ground. So it makes sense.	
1	Yeah, and that's how I see it. I see it as I'm putting something natural and my body and my body apparently reacts to it in a good way. So it's kind of like they're meant to be together in some way just like like marijuana. We have these receptors and their they kind of work together and seems to work out just fine. You know, it's just when you put in alcohol you put in these other synthetic things that you start to have his reactions is negative results the hey	
2	hangovers the crappy feeling and you know now they're finding out there's a endocannabinoid system in our body already. So we already have receptors for THC that so we could be like the same way people need protein and a certain amount of water. We might need cannabis to fill these receptors. It might be like a necessity to make us lower supposed to be like who is the first person to say we need protein and we need to drink this much water now and to make these things that things that make us a complete person like THC might be one of	
1	Those things that's what I think and I but I think it's the same thing for for psilocybin. I mean you look at all these ancient cultures, you know, like ancient cultures in Egypt or in Jerusalem in Israel and then in like in Mexico where the Aztecs and the Mayans were they have artwork that has mushrooms on it both sigh both of them do so, both of them had this type of connection with with with with psilocybin and they had no relation to each other. So it's Global its worldwide with all these different civilizations. It's not like this is something brand-new, you know.	
2	Yeah definitely connects everyone from everywhere anytime. I can be anyone from anywhere do anything if they're if it's psychedelics everyone they kind of fit into the same community of love and empathy and that kind of thing and you know, what's funny is that I go to do these shows, you know, I travel all over the state and I do calmly	
1	YouTube likes if I'm you know microdose in something like that. I've had people come to the like. Hey man, do you like streams and I'm like, yeah and they're like, oh me too. I'm like dude. How did you know they're like, I don't know. I just felt you had It's just sometimes you just have that connection with somebody if they're on it and you're on it and kind of your your your Vibe catches them. Let me let me yeah, you know your third eyes are looking at each other. It's kind of woozy but it can't fight it. It happens. You know, I my friends I like I talk like you don't even sound like a cop anymore. I'm like, I'm not I'm a comedian who smokes weed and does mushrooms. This is	
2	Can I ask you a question before you ever took any type of psychedelic? Did you have like a predisposed opinion about it? Did you like judge it or did you have a negative opinion towards it or where did you totally avoid them or not?	
1	I mean I tried school and I tried mushrooms, but probably not enough to do anything and I was probably drinking at the same time and running around so and it really noticed and I just never really gave it any thought now throughout my career, you know, it's always like you can't do you can't be a cop and have done hallucinogenics like that's an automatic. Matic disqualifier, so I had to lie to get into law enforcement. I just say that I had never tried it and I never really had an opinion about it as a conflict. Like I said, my my opinion was that I was going after people who were doing stuff like peddling pills and Manufacturing methamphetamine and stuff like that guns and stuff. I dealt or wanted to even deal with with natural stuff. I have friends that that are cops in Santa Cruz and they're like, oh, yeah, we busted this house for like 50 pounds of marijuana. I'm like, so what it's a plant dude like and I used to have to go on marijuana bust like we go out in this out in the mountains and we have to like jump in these marijuana Gardens from helicopter and take down these people that are in there that are armed and stuff like that and at the end of the day, I always think like I'm going to risk it and shot over a fucking plant like it to be it seems like so stupid. It's stupid.	
2	You know, it's like the dumbest thing and understand why we're doing it because the people who haven't tried it to that had so against it that are the ones that are probably all by the books of all the police books and all that. They never smoked through there like marijuana is against the law.	
1	Fuck you and a gateway drug, right? That's what I always hear. It's a gateway drug how it leads. Laziness that leads to this and productivity while I smoke weed every day. I work out every day I kick box or they have a full-time job and I do comedy on the side and I'm stoned most of the time so that's all bullshit.	
2	You know, same here man, if you could like write books and make music and shit and smoke weed and it's fine. Like if you could do things if you go to school if you have a job and you smoke weed if you do anything if you're a parent if you if you do ignore You do normal society things when you smoke weed. It's not taking you to another place where your this space cadet that's not doing anything. Like you're a contributing member of society.	
1	We're just productive human, you know, I mean, you're responsible human and it doesn't matter what you do if if you smoke weed and all you do is play music, but that's your passion. Then you're productive, you know, if you smoke weed and you work at 80 hour work week because that's your passion or that's what you have to do. Then when you're productive, you know, and the perception is that it just makes you lazy. It makes you lazy. It makes you you know this and that and and it's truly not the case that people that were lazy we're going to be lazy anyway, so they didn't mean we do that, you know, the people who are unproductive they're going to do that. Anyways, it's not going to be the way that does it. But with we funny is that when I would be on these marijuana busts and I worked with cops that had tried in high school as well. They do like we would all get together kind of off to the side of everybody else and like the smell of it. And can we smell it? You know? Oh, yeah, it smells good and then you just kind of throw it aside because you know, you everybody tried it.	
2	Yeah, I mean, it's just funny how just shout out just the perceptions are on plans. That's you're in a really special position with this whole half Used to Be Cops. Now, you're a psychedelic Advocate type guy because I think it's really the cops of the ones that need the information the most that everyone.	
1	Yeah, and my friends that are cops, they see the change in me. But like dude you just have your person. I'm like, I'm genuinely happy now. I was depressed when I wasn't a cop anymore. I was bored. You know, it really didn't seem like his when I was a cop. I had a purpose right? I was a community servant. I was out there helping people I was protecting and serving and all that bullshit and then I became not a cop. I was just I was just part of The Daily Grind and to me that seemed like it really it was a job. I had a job but I didn't have to worry a purpose now. I feel like I have a purpose. I have my comedy. I have my my voice and I have what I'm trying to push forward which is I could don't people I've I've I've I've helped friends of mine that have gone through some issues that aren't cops, but I'd help them and I've pointed them in the direction of psilocybin and I've done it for three people and all three of them are just showing phenomenal results. One of them has really bad anxiety and shakes, you know in the shakes and stuff like that and in depression and they're just they're like this thing is actually helping me and they're not taking the medication the doctors gave him anymore. So it's not just me. It's people around me that are benefiting from it. So it's not like it's just a one-off thing. This is actually something that's true. It's something that is actually helping people.	
2	Yeah, yeah, definitely and she definitely treated more like a medicine drug because you know things get way too stigmatized and labeled and put in a box way too easily. So it's good to push for nature because you know, when you don't we are talking about the last podcast how often too many times things are stigmatized and you know, they there's a lot of information that passes around as a result of it and it's good that you're going to be standing. Ending up for your community. So you want to push for the decriminalization in San Jose specifically or do you did you mean entirely California?	
1	I would like it in, California.	
2	I drive hope so too.	
1	Definitely and could you talk about this organization called decriminalized nature a little bit more about what they do is it's a as an advocate Advocate Group and they're just they're broken up into areas of California. So those like Northern California Central California and Southern California in each one of them has like representative. And so what they're doing is they're doing a lot of volunteer work as far as Pushing the information out the proper information out of the benefits of psilocybin, you know and trying to educate people trying to get and put on like maybe like town halls and bring members of the community and to try to educate them on the benefits of psilocybin and what it would mean if it was introduced to their Community wouldn't be something that would be bad. It would be something that would be beneficial. You know, it would be beneficial to have people that were on something natural than running around on. On pills, you know addicted to that prescription opiates, you know, and it's getting together and hoping to get the measure passed on the 2020 ballot.	
2	How does just next year ya know if it's if you push for it, is there a high chance that it might be decriminalized? What do you think about that?	
1	I think we're on we're on the right track because Oakland just decriminalized it. Yeah, they decriminalized all plant based. So they analyze psilocybin they criminalize peyote and they decriminalized Ayahuasca. Like that's huge. They didn't just say let's do mushrooms just went let's just do it across the board.	
2	We went School.	
1	Bo now just legalize on the church went full Shaman, right everybody, you know, so I mean you're talking like the most violent city one of the most violent cities in California not anymore before I'm like that place is going to be a great music on the weekends over loudspeakers. And this is going to be it's going to be a base either gonna have free Taco Saturday's volleyball in the streets shed.	
2	Yeah.	
1	They just get have Beach cruise nights, you know where we just watch beach cruiser through Oakland and you know and sprinkles glitter on each other. I'm excited. I'm happy for them. I'm glad they did it but now it's like okay, it is not a small town right? It's a city and it's not even San Francisco. I would have got 7 Cisco did it first broke when did it and so I'm hoping like San Francisco's next San Jose. Let's get it down to LA.	
2	And then once that happens, I mean shit man, so New Jersey if you get on California's love,	
1	Yeah, and Denver's the one that kicked it off, right? Denver's gangster get Denver doesn't care.	
2	Yeah, I know Deborah actually passed a measure where I believe jobs can't deny people if they fail their marijuana test. Yeah. Yeah.	
1	Look if smoking piece of a joint shows up on your drug test from two weeks ago, but you got people who drink on a daily basis at work.	
2	Like which one is danger did I used to order fake piss online the past my drug test from smoking weed now, he's my brother want carries fake piss in his truck.	
1	He's a truck driver. He just carries with them in case they pulled him and he's just gonna dump it, you know because they can't have marijuana system and I'm like That's crazy. Because I mean if you're a truck driver to me those scariest thing would be like alcohol. You know, what? Why would why would smoking weed the night before it's like anything that's a downer. Right? Right opiates, right people that are taking painkillers, you know and fall asleep behind the wheel of a semi that's dangerous, you know, but the problem is that marijuana is fat soluble it stays in your system for So it seems like times are changing and I'm excited. I really like it a new era right now. We're in this weird point in time and space where everybody's kind of like floating the ideas of psychedelics in and people are starting to accept a little bit more not quite enough but a little bit more and it's like, okay, let's keep them. Let's keep this momentum going now. Let's keep the ball rolling forward.	
2	Yeah. We're definitely in The Mists of the major psycho psychedelic Revolution. And this goes for show that now that the US has started to decriminalize it might start even going as far as other countries, you know, Europe, you know, the Middle East. I'm not sure what the Middle East but I know they did MDMA testing over there for and people like PTSD and isn't yeah I do is Israel some courage and there's there's some countries that have decriminalized all drugs.	
1	Like I think it's Peru right Peru, they drew decriminalized everything Portugal. Analyzed everything.	
2	So I think that's the best move because drop some drugs are in the public domain where ever they are.	
1	Anyway, people are going to take drugs. This just happened in a few but if you make the demand hi, that's what creates these drug wars. That's what creates this violence if you just decriminalize it take the value out of it, then then the drug traffickers don't need the to cross the border with you know, with with a bunch of weed or a bunch of heroin or bunch of math because it just get it here.	
2	Like a dentist you see use cocaine instead of the fucking whatever numbing stuff they use now there used to be cocaine and Coca-Cola.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. I think I might and I was part of the drug war. Like that was my was my area of expertise was was drug violence. And I think even though all my friends are still like fighting that good War out there against drugs. I'm like dude legalize it all just legalize it it'll be fine. That's my opinion.	
2	It's a really good opinion a half very open-minded because if if you're asked to call about legalizing, I'm pretty sure he would not say that at all. No have you the soldiers that were given LSD and like the 70s hmm instead of following the orders and saluting and everything. They just started dancing around in circles and the drill sergeant is like what the fuck like they didn't want to follow orders. They were like ripping their shirt off. They took their Badge off and shit. It was like this whole thing.	
1	Yeah, and then they and then they ended up working for the same Clinic that they that was testing on them. And then they just took a bunch of the LSD and then spread it around San Francisco and the place became just a place of Love Like that's that's what happened. You know that the CIA. Steam and then the people who they were doing the testing on said know what this stuff is great. We're gonna we're gonna steal some and send it out into the City and its scared Society because all these people were just like having a great time.	
2	Hey, Ken Kesey riding around on a bus just handed out. You know, he's the throat. I was Ste parties to yeah, Timothy we read all them you guys all of you. So you've heard of like MKUltra and how the CIA Have undercover cops going to these parties and watch people on our see and make reports of it. And the reason why it was made illegal was because people were you know, not following orders, you know, people weren't for being themselves. They weren't being manipulated. They weren't under any type of Mind Control they were thinking for themselves and that's why I like since the government couldn't use it for any type of you know for war criminals if they're trying to get information because you know, obviously if Um one small can be manipulated. They're not going to give up information. So that's why they you know, and plus there's a lot of fear behind it too. But now that that fears dissipating it's really great that people can be more open about it.	
1	Yeah. I mean they big they created freethinkers and that scared them.	
2	Yeah.	
1	Well that's care of them. And so now now we're at that turning point now where people want to be free thinkers, you know, and so I think that's why I were	
2	We're in this this year period when like this shift from the industrial to the information age.	
1	Well, I think my personal opinion is that once you start getting more people on board and more people look T. Trying psilocybin, like politicians and stuff like that. You're going to put an end to this Republican Democrat like you to put it into all these like dividing lines and you're going to people going to be more hybrid know you should you really shouldn't be only a Democrat or only Republican are only a liberal only conservative. You should have views on a little bit of everything they might.	
2	With it is that they're exactly the same and they just swap views every eight years like the Democrats have made years ago or the Republicans and today and vice versa exactly.	
1	Exactly. And so voting on a party to me seems ridiculous. You should be voting on issues, right? It should be an issue. Not not not a party things. I think I think when you start introducing these free-thinking substances and these natural substances, you're going to start seeing more of this free thinking and more these hybrid hybrid type politics and what I hope to see I hope to see like a change in the government help it trickles up.	
2	Yeah, definitely because these all these parties do or just create mental biases and there's no work and actually getting done. You know, I mean, there's no resolutions. They're just two people arguing with each other's ego. And I feel like people definitely need experience ego deaths and to see what it's like to be out of your own body and to see things from a different perspective rather than just being so boxed minded and narrow thinking and yeah, yeah. That is instead of a representative of what you think their ideas. Are you can just load on the actual ideas through the internet or something. Yeah. The person behind it. They have all these personal things about them that go into it. But if it's just the idea itself then just get rid of the person because you don't know who the person is.	
1	Yeah, right because the person has different could have a different intentions which we see that all the time. Yeah out of it.
