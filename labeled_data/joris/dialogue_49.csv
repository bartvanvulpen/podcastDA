Everybody Welcome to the fan the bike podcast. This is our second episode. We have our returning guest the Fairy Godmother of this podcasting Keys. Say hi everybody and we have our special guest call the wolf or the big bad cold Wolf cast. How you doing call.	
2	Hey, what's up everybody your Legend Cole. Well, that's a good thing or a bad thing. I don't know.	
1	It's a great thing. We knew it all along.	
3	We have gotten together to and we're heading responded to an ask on Tumblr and we got an ask to have cold that will find he create so thank you. Yay. Whoo. And so let's start. How did you even get involved in this mess of a fandom for?	
2	Um, I remember it was back during the first season when it was episode 9 the scene where Styles pushes Derek are Derek bushes. Stiles up against the door, and I thought that they were going to kiss but they didn't so then I kind of just dropped the whole thing didn't really think anything of it and then in like 2012. I got Tumblr and I saw like a piece of fan art for Styles and Derek and I was like, oh there are other people who thought the same thing that I thought so then I checked the stair tag, and this was back when like there was like three pieces of like fan art and like a few little pose. And then I found out about shipping and fandom and like before that. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what shipping was and like steric was like my first Fick and then I just kind of just stayed in the fandom as if that's the show went on in the guns like season 2 when Jeff was like talking about steric more on Twitter back when he had a Twitter. He wasn't scared to talk to us.	
1	I will say the fact that you said that because I know for a while like I think you still have a post in the archives.	
2	It's like Jeff Davis is a genius and remember us all being Bamboozled for like a good while but him I have so many posts and like probably tweets that were like, I remember just like a while ago like a few months ago. I found like an old tweet of mine that was like Jeff wouldn't do steady eye. He knows that it's not going to work he is not Down he's a good writer. He would never do that. It's like the foolishness the ignore my God I had for this man.	
3	I totally remember that the period of time where I was like, oh he's so great and people just need to leave them alone and back off. You have a lot of pressure from the network let the man work and all that stuff like that, but we'll took it to another level like we have the whole Jeff Davis has a gift hashtag.	
1	And that's where Jeff Davis is not a gift. And Jeff Davis is a dick came from which I love.	
3	So when did you first realize that you had the coal the wolf reputation?	
2	Um, I don't know the exact moment. I feel like it was some sort of like obscure moment. Like I would post something and we get a lot of like notes fairly quickly. I felt like I knew I don't know. Maybe it was Posey gate with the whole like telling Posey's mom on me and like right now I don't like go through so much. Effort for a fan obviously.	
1	I had some sort of leg effect on the fandom or like some sort of power that I had what else I do have a question how involved were you when it came to stare at campaign and sitting in Clinton that whole thing. Were you kind of cool with them at some point or was it always kind of standoffish?	
2	Um, I mean, I was friendly with them. I wasn't like part of like the group though. Like they were big-name fans and I was a big name fan but I was like off sort of on my own. They think like I contributed to like the different events that they did but I wasn't like in like the planning or in that group at all.	
1	So I would just another fan outside of that I think because when I when I was doing my research I'm back in the day. I kept hearing about oh called The Wolf he's evil and he's terrible at I'm like really seems fine to me. He loves Derek's or why not and started doing just some digging and I noticed that the second that people started talking to you and by people, I mean industry people insiders people involved with the show. That's when things kind of started to go sour on the steric side, and I think That that 100% is because of jealousy basically and then they're like, well, you know who's pulling him stuff? Why does he get to know anything and that's usually kind of how that starts.	
3	Yeah. I think there's a huge misconception that is sterics. We have were like this huge Juggernaut that's cohesive and there really are many factions within steric. Who? Oh, yes each have their own idea of what a steric and what is acceptable and yeah, well you should be	
2	Well, I remember I forgot what year it was, but it was in December of one year that I was talking to the people from the after-show and back then I think Steph was kind of like you're not supposed to talk about it. Like it was already starting to get to that point but it wasn't as bad as it got with the rest of the show because they wanted me to get on that show. Show and I was talking to like the people behind that and I was supposed to be on that show and then it kind of stretched a few months. Like I was supposed to be on in December and then that got rescheduled there was some sort of like internal problem with the filming or whatever. So then it was rescheduled to like March or something. And then when we got to March it was like, oh, you know this guy handed off to different people like different Executives that took control over it and then I was kicked off. Then they got whoever I don't know. Who else.	
1	Okay, so we need to talk about that. This is what I'm so funny because I had completely forgot that happen. But that is actually how I think I got to know you and so I really do think that that was the turning point because that's when people are like Lenin he doesn't even like the show he just loves staring. Why would they invite him on and I remember cuz the very first guest Was Not Another Teen Wolf podcast test and then they had the Argent crew then I forget who was on after that. It was an artist was it not dot but Kendra. Okay. I can't remember her artist named Klaus some Kendrick laws something like that. It's like oh, yeah, right and it was all leaning very much one way. And so when there was kind of, you know thoughts of like, oh, let's have someone who's going Hysteric on like who are they going to choose? Who are they going to choose? I don't know that people were talking about it. But I think at that point that's when you kind of start with like, you know, I was kind of told XYZ and that's kind of where that all sparked it, but that's hilarious. I completely forgot about that.	
2	And then I remember it exactly how messy that was what it was because I remember the interview because I had a scheduled like webcam interview with two of the people. All that were in charge of that and they just like ask me a bunch of questions. So they've asked me like who's your favorite character? When did you start watching the show? What is your favorite thing about the show and literally my favorite character was Styles. I started watching the show when it first started airing like the very first episode I tuned in and I told them like my favorite part of the show is steric and they were like, why is that, you know, your favorite part of the show and I explain to them why I liked the two characters together and like Part of what shipping was like I gave them kind of like a like Outsider kind of information. So I didn't go into like depth as to what it was and they seem fine with it. Like they didn't seem like shocked they're like hesitant and then of you went fine, and then I guess I got handed down to the other people who were like no, but they did have a steric on they had it right when they changed president's yeah. They had a guy. Who was supposed to be doing like a game like a video game? Yes, and I never happen. I wonder why they probably got shut down or something and they were like you can't make this even though it was going to be like out of his own time and again nothing to do but the show but that game never came out. But I remember he had like video footage of like the first like be getting up. Game, yeah and looked fine. Like I was excited for it, but it never came out.	
1	So Teen Wolf is a bunch of promises that never get fulfilled just like the the you Kimora spin-off the young Derek spin-off, you know this podcast hilarious, you're like the podcast.	
2	None of them are voice actors, like the only one who could probably do it is Dylan and he's not going to be a part of that.	
1	That so that was the best part of the interview. Did you remember that interview where they were like, he was like, oh, there's going to be a thing of Team. Oh, yeah. He was can guarantee you I will not 100% not be involved don't hurt him.	
3	But I heard I'm not gonna let them use my name anymore. Am I gonna see you? Imagine if they had really gotten off the ground? They would have been flashing his face everywhere, even if he wasn't Signed on to it. No, definitely.	
1	Yeah, but the only thing that we did miss out on in a naughty sent me this in actually reminded me of it is originally if they had gotten a season 7 Scott was supposed to pass off somehow. I don't know what the logic behind it is, but he was supposed to pass off his Alpha to Liam so that Liam could take care of Beacon Hills while he was at school. And so I'm like does that He's not an alpha anymore. Like he's just gonna give it up. You know, it's just so crazy. But then Alex was going to be the new Teen Wolf and then they were going to you know, do this whole 2.0 thing and I remember Jeff talking about that. And so I'm like if the aunties knew that Scott wasn't the office and he gave it to a white boy I would die and I wanted to happen. It's Canon as far as I'm concerned.	
3	I mean they really I mean if they were going to do it, they really should have passed it off to a girl.	
1	Oh 100% a girl of color. Like honestly at this point because they're yeah, they just got real trifling towards the end. They started all white and they ended all white. It's just like come on y'all for this, you know Place free of racism homophobia.	
3	Okay. So Scandal wise like by this time when you were having like issues with that interview and you're already having a little bit of blowback Scott stands or rampant during this time, right? Look, I can't even remember.	
2	Um, because I don't remember what the year that that happened.	
1	I think I was still it had to be 13 was it had to be 2013 because it was before Posey gate. It was me. I'm 20 show Right exactly and that 2013 would have been is that when 3A was airing I think February 13th 2013 was one that Posey gate happened right bizarre burst with their 1400 Posey gate was 2014.	
2	I believe it.	
1	So this was like before this like a year before because because him coming out his lamp was 2015. So yeah, I'm thinking it had to be 2013. Is it would have been when 3A was airing and I know that's when people were still excited but also being like we're steric though.	
3	Yeah, you're right Teen Wolf was February 2005. There's armor Twisted was February 2014 and which was when 3B was airing it is so then what happened with call would have been well three a was airing hmm probably. At that time you said like butts it was different back in the day. Right? Like it wasn't just the loud voice got stands that we have right now. It was like packs of them, right?	
2	I almost feel like they were quieter. Like I don't commend ourselves. They were more I think hesitant to say anything like they said things obviously, but they were so quiet. Down by the fact that the show talked about steric the actors talked about steric. We talked about steric. They were kind of off like they didn't have any sort of voice to that. They would come up occasionally and like different things and like complain but I feel like the required or back then they got louder sort of as the show started turning against Eric.	
1	Well, you know the turning point it what they were quieter, but it was because the show was supporting steric a at that point still and so as soon as bizarre weird Twisted happened just like with the stupid election, they became emboldened and we're like very just going to spread our hey, I do want to talk more about the poses mom thing and of course, you know, there is a bit of sensitivity to the issues since she has passed but I thought that that was so foul. And that's really if anything that got me. Twisted and what steric was actually about it was that because that was dirty on another level when it came to the Scott stands and they're like for them to go to her and then be like, well he say he made death threats against your son never happened and they're just like, why would you tell her that and then of course, she's like, oh who's this whole the wolf person she needs to get along just completely clueless and like okay, Mom. AMA lecture, but it was just so it's just thing that's kind of happening that kind of happened with Megan Tandy that still really upsets me is that like they go to her specifically to turn them against us when it's like we don't have a problem with you.	
2	Yeah. I remember specifically with posies mom thing because I don't even know that she was like involved with Twitter and then I got a bunch of messages that Oh my God, you know she's talking about you blah blah blah and then I went and checked I think people like especially the aunties were expecting me to like attack her because I was very like I was very like loud and like if you say something I'm gonna say something to you, but I wasn't going to like fight with this like woman. She doesn't understand what's happening. All she thinks is that her son is getting like a tact and so she's just coming to His defense like I'm not gonna like argue with her something and I said something like that was like I'm not gonna argue with her or say anything mean to her. She's just a mom were looking out for her child, whatever and I was kind of the end of that and then it came out that like she was hacked or something like they hacked her account to do all this. I was just like how desperate are you to start like drama?	
3	Whoa, wait they hacked her account. I think I get the message to her about you.	
2	I don't know if they hacked her account to get the message or they hacked her account to like tweet things about me.	
1	Yeah, because there were a bunch of deleted tweets after that and I don't know because we have screencaps of her initial response, but then there were more that were deleted and I think that's where the Hat came in at. Yeah.	
3	I mean those people I mean they were always crazy. I mean remember when Studios got busted for hacking Pole or I think that that was funny.	
1	That was I remember when we had to study a versus steric pole and yeah, they someone was running Bots and then like girls were crying and they're like, I made my mom boat 96.	
2	It's like a sis every time that we like for the most part that we would occasionally lose but it would be like loss to like destiel. What exactly if it's outside of the yeah, but we also beat them a few times in different polls and like knows Madness was everything there was no ship and to move that ever came close to being able to beat like it would be like it would be steric versus like studio and we would win and then like the studios would be like, okay new poll, here's stare and here's there and it would be like only like to study a fancy.	
1	They could win and it's like this isn't even ours long know the best one was someone tried to post a steric versus D'Elia versus stadia because the studio thought that the sterics were going to be split and then it would just be steady all the way but I'm like no you instantly are going to be split. So just like as soon as we started dominating someone hit that delete button. This is like, oh what happened what happened to the pole?	
3	Messy, what's the one Tumblr Scandal? I hit you like the most they either with personal or like you just got really angry when I had it for a while.	
2	Um, it was probably I feel like the one that was angry was when I was like livid at the show, which was after the still Leah episode and I can house When doused Eric wasn't going to happen and all of this craziness was happening was there is what was it called? Um, so it was the collective that Teen Wolf People we're going to create like their own Tumblr called the collective and they were going to upload like you could upload pictures of fan art and whatever and it was so obvious like they were only going to include hetero Actual fan art like they weren't going to allow / shipping and it was just a way for them to like control their fandom like the Teen Wolf and um, and I got a message from somebody who like I can't reveal who they are, but they worked with like this system. It was like listen you have influence amongst the Teen Wolf and mm based on like how popular you are and you have a voice if you speak out. Out against this it will like stop the Teen Wolf people from trying to do whatever it is that they're doing and so they were like you can write a post and just like tell the fandom don't you know mess with this Collective crab don't you know join this? Yes, just you know a way for them to control the fandom and then I like I've looked at like their terms of service or whatever and it was like if you upload a piece of fan art, they You can complete control of that own it own it to like do whatever it is that they want to do with it. So I just formulated this giant post and then I think I uploaded like I posted it before the collective even dropped. So like it was before like it got announced that it was gonna be like into like for like usage. So I uploaded it and people just went crazy over it saying I'm not using this. This is crap blah blah blah and then the piece ER guy who worked at the time for the Teen Wolf PR like ranted on it and like sub tweeted me and he said he said something like like I hate when people who don't know what they're talking about come in and ruin something that you've been working on for like months and I'm like, well, sorry, we all know who that guy was and he still trash to this day.	
3	But I mean, let's talk about the level of padding things like multiple people associated with Move I've gotten Petty with fans to a level. I don't think I've really used to I mean, I think the only thing that comes close is like Steven Universe, but like I heard that been in what kind of aren't it was a Steven Universe or Voltron Voltron Voltron where you know, there was a huge class between the Show creator people of people involved with the show and fandom and they actually kind of went back and forth with each other, but that was later. So like before Teen Wolf, I don't really remember that happening. Often enough for people to find out about it.	
2	I feel like it didn't happen with like fandom because I felt like there was a census that I've heard of of like creators trying to ban fanfiction and trying to like copyright strike fan fiction from people because you know, it wasn't their Vision or whatever but I feel like at least for me Teen Wolf was the instant of them like actively trying to like hurt fans and like Do it publicly right that it was like, okay.	
1	Well then just think about remember at sdcc where they had that thing where they were reading the fan fiction. And in fact, that's kind of how we originally got involved with Edie and we were actually on her side because she was like that was disgraceful like they had him reading this big but it was purely to make fun of it and purely the laugh at the author was fine, but it was like still that's not a good look. Yeah. Yeah and And then that on top of Jeff's whole thing that Linden let slip where Jeff was like, you know, they told us no, in fact, I think Hoechlin even said it in an interview in Dillon to maybe we've been like don't look at any of the fan art don't look at any of the fanfic. I'll do that. I'll take care of that for you. I'll respond to that for you. You don't have to deal with that and I was just like side I now for the collective that what so the reason people found out about it. Is because a few people were invited to start adding their stuff to open it up and so the link and if there wasn't an announcement yet in the link wasn't public but just kind of threw, you know DM's and that kind of stuff people were beginning to know what it was. So when your post came out because I already thought it was shady. So in your post gave out we were like, oh, yeah, it's definitely Shady Shady boots, but like I think because like the big-name	
2	Ann's in the fandom would get like we would get messages and like diems from people who are Anonymous who were like with the show and like there was instance where people from the show would like give us spoilers of like what's going to happen and it would be like written in a very vague kind of way but like you can get like the just of it and then when like the show kind of started turning against Eric, we would still get or at least I did we Get messages from like inserts in the show of like ways to like be one step ahead of like their mess. It's to like actively post about it. So that way when it came out fans will like already like in the know like fans already knew what the mess was going to be like had a way to like prepare for just how shitty the show was which was weird. Like I want to know who these people were who were like on the side of the fandom and not on the Side of the show like who like who would risk their job to do that? It didn't make sense. Here.	
1	He is the Beast somebody and I think that that's why because ultimately I think one of the reasons especially what what do we want to call them Timmy Mick em. He I think one of the reasons he was petty is because we didn't see Whatever. He was told the big picture was he couldn't show us the big picture and so all he saw was us being very upset and rightfully, so but instead of being like Oh, no, you're rightfully upset is just like will screw it. You know, you guys don't know what you're talking about and it's like yeah, we don't know and that's the problem is that we're reacting to this nonsense that you guys are throwing at us. I remember when we interviewed Chantal love her love her love her, but we are you know, Did you ever talk about steric onset? And she was like no, nope. Nope, never know and it was just like and then we asked her like who do you ship and she's like, oh, yes, Derek and never talked about it. All right, never ever ever never on set. You know, and I was like, I don't they're still a timeline of leadership that I'm very interested in it and that show because I was I was contacted which was interesting. Maybe because it was late. It was like 2015 but it was by a lawyer who used to work on the show. And so, you know just got some general Dietz that way because you know, he didn't have anything new of course, but the idea that yeah, there were these malls and you could see it sometimes in the writing but the problem was in trying to help us they ended up mucking up the cannon and mucking up the it even more because it's like I would kind of rather just have it Crash and Burn and just be mad at it than having these little things pop up or like oh wait, is that something and it's not them it wasn't them trying to give us hope but it was more like we see you.	
2	We know, you know that kind of thing, but it's so interesting and like confusing because like during season 4 like sterics were not like we were not here for I didn't even watch these in for I watched literally the finale and only the finale because I got information that there's going to be a big steric moment in it. And I was told like there could be a hug or a kiss which there wasn't a hug or a kiss but it was a big steric moment and it was like, why is the show actively trying to like kill steric but then have a moment like that where you have Derek dying and so many different like the he was going back to Styles over and over and over again. Like she'll why is that in the show like who put that in there if you guys hated so much which I have wooden table fan.	
1	Yeah, when we were in the beginning it was like romantic mood lighting display.	
2	Like I don't understand that like it doesn't make sense to me why that was put in the show when it they actively tried to like tear steric apart.	
3	At the time I had this like very innocent idea what was going on that these were just kind of like fan moments given like spread out throughout the show just to be like, oh we see the kind of like things that we see you, but obviously we're gonna go there but now that I'm looking back on it. It just looks like they put in those moments to string us along. Yeah, but it worked enough that some people were strongly strung along enough that they went to the end.	
2	But the thing that's what I was thinking.	
1	Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about in terms of undesired consequences. The thing that we have to realize about a show is that you have the showrunner you have the writers, but then you also have the director and you have the editors specifically the editors. Those are going to be the ones are like, oh this shot and then he's going to look at him. They don't like him, you know, and they do kind of work in tandem, but each one. Those people have their own motive and I think what we caught in was this person's like who's Derek? I'm gonna you know, they're not going to do on the show. I'm going to slip this in for the fans ha ha ha and then you have the people like, oh well slip in a little steric and kind of string along the fans and then you have someone's like no staring and so it's just this mishmash of all these different motives and it makes it entirely confusing because you also have to remember that by season for we're dealing with Shelly. They either made a huge mistake or someone was really exposing but there was a storyboard release of their ideas. It was like an outline for season 3 be specifically for 320 and on that board. It said Styles mom, but it did and it was like in small letter. So something that you could tell that they weren't really expecting people to pick up but specifically there was no mention of Malia no mention of Shelley nothing. And so it's like you give Holland talks about used to talk about getting the scripts the same day and I'm like you have a period of time that is specifically for writing. Yeah, what is happening that you're giving scripts the same day of shooting what's going on in here? What's this mishmash?	
2	And I think that's the part that we don't get I'm still like because I'm still confused about 320 and I've talked to people behind the scenes have Nation about this and I mean Dylan already came out he went to Alpha Kane. He just like dragged Jeff for riding in the sex scene and he talked about how there was supposed to be like a moment with Stiles is Mom. But specifically for like that episode there was talk about how Dylan was confused as to why it was going in the direction that it was going so suddenly and made absolutely no sense and because Like there was well there was talk about the how there was supposed to be steric and how it there was going to be a build-up to steric. It was actually going to happen and that there was like plans and there was agreement and contracts between certain actors to like build it up whatever and that it just all shifted randomly for no reason, which I still don't know about it still don't know the information. There's still missing pieces that just nobody need to talk to anymore because nobody's connected to the show.	
1	They kicked excellent kick rocks only person used to be involved with the show that talks about anymore. We'll try it it for like a week and then I think he got another job and he was like by and then but except for Jeff who makes a lot of you know things about shows he's never going to make and then Eric occasionally and only because they bought that stupid	
2	Yeah, so what load it like there's the actors don't talk about it anymore. I mean unless you go to a con but right, um, other than that, nobody talks about the show anymore writers who wrote on the show don't talk about seed as is closed or talk about the show even if apocalypse.	
3	He was trying to like cut each to like bringing the Skiles fans. Like they have a so gross so that they would watch now a cut pocalypse.	
1	- I'm sure he was trying to stir drama to the show desert to be can't and I called it at the very beginning. I was like this is not going to everybody so sorry, we lost connection for a bit.	
3	So we're coming back. And does anybody remember what we were saying though, if we talking about their child, let's see.	
1	Oh all the different changes within that. Basically we thought steric was coming. Oh and you were talking about Alpha con how Dylan was basically drag the show and there was all these things that he didn't know. Yeah, and I was just going to input that there were a lot of leadership changes during that time. But again, we don't know who influenced what and ultimately because Jeff was gone for a minute and I'm pretty sure Jeff was fired for a minute and but it was right at the same time as a like. The crossover where the change in leadership because LJ is Lindsay Jewett Sturman. She was in charge of season 5 for the most part. She took Jeff's notes and then really kind of cobbled that together and then they announced that season six was Jeff's last they got Hall age, which I'm like y'all paid out the but for this and then you know Season 6, so I'm like this wasn't a someone was doing him a favor. That wasn't no you deserve that. That's okay. Finally going to get rid of you. If you want to go out with a bang. That's fine. This is not going to been syndicating Teen Wolf on MTV. It's crazy to me.	
3	Does anybody even want to neck? I don't know.	
2	Look. I know I have that channel, but I don't watch only watch TV anyways, but like I'm gonna watch that I guess teenagers like similar thing. It was other stuff to watch now. Like they want to Riverdale now.	
1	Yep, if they don't make archaea werewolf. Okay. Anyhow, go ahead.	
3	Imagine. If I do go that route. I mean they've already gone like all the other mess my why not. I'm okay. So this is concluding the show drama portion of the show. We went a little bit over. It's okay. I'm so we will get back to You I want to thank everybody for listening and say goodnight call. Good night guys. Good night. Sticky. Good night. All right, let's go for call a big. Thanks. I make sure to go ahead and send me your asks to Fan them by that tumblr.com. You can go ahead and visit Colette cold the wolf that tumblr.com and sticky at Bhed podcast.com blur.com, and y'all have a good night. Thanks for listening.
