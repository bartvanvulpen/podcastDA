You're going to be elevating your skills by learning all these really important strategies that you know bar. Prep traditional bar exam prep courses really don't get into and so I'm excited for you. And one thing I wanted to tell you if you want it to follow along with what I'm reviewing in these particular podcast episodes for both sa subject attack review and MBE subject attack reviews. Then what you can do is the attack outlines that are in the program you could just pull them up and you can follow along with what I'm covering for these birds eye view reviews of the various subjects. Okay, so let's get right into it. There's next topic remedies one thing you should just keep in mind is remedies is basically the thing of why law exists, right? If somebody's rights have been infringed upon the whole purpose of the legal system the whole purpose of going through and filing a complaint responding. You know summary judgment going to trial going on appeal is basically to determine whether one party is entitled to a certain Remedy or not. And in the world of Remedies remember remedies will appear some on the mbes right because it's part of torts. It's part of contracts, but they will also appear in the essays. Right, and that's why I'm reviewing it in the context of the essays because you will be asked to write about various issues as to whether a certain party is entitled to a certain remedy and then give the counter-argument to why that party shouldn't be entitled to us particular remedy right and so on a very, you know bird's eye view big picture remedy you always look for the legal remedy. That's the first part you always look for the legal remedy first. Then the Equitable remedy. Well, what's the legal remedy? Typically that's money right legal remedies are money. So, you know, I should have been I should be paid this amount of money for the wrong that was caused on me. Right and then the the other type of Remedy Equitable remedies, right and typically that involves some form of injunction some form of specific performance. Basically the court ordering you to do something or telling you to stop. Doing something. So it doesn't necessarily involve the transfer of money from one hand to another it involves the court stepping in a much more stringent way and saying your actions need to stop right now or you have failed to act and now I'm asking you I'm forcing you to act or you'll suffer the consequences, right? So again, that's just very very in initial background so that you can Stand where remedies all fits in right? And so again you always look for legal remedies first and then to Equitable remedies then the second part of Remedies in the third part. They're closely related you look at tort remedies, right and then you look at tort legal remedies and then the third part is you look at toward Equitable remedies. So for tort remedies totally legal remedies that is you know, damages and restitution and for Equitable remedies it typically is some form of injunctive relief and so for Equitable remedies in tour, what you need to look at is okay part of what you analyze is are the legal remedies and adequate right? And there's there's a whole set of elements that you just need to run through and make sure that you understand to determine whether injunctive relief in tort is appropriate in Particular essay or not? Okay. So that's the second and the third part and then the fourth and fifth Parts. They're also pretty straightforward a follow the same format. The fourth part is what our contractual legal remedies, right? And then what our contract related Equitable remedies, right? And so your contractual legal remedies also again tend to be damages such as compensatory damages nominal damages liquidated damages incidental damages. Punitive damages again. We're talking about money, right and then there are Equitable remedies that include things like just completely completely eliminating an agreement such as rescission, right or rewriting the contract which is Reformation, right? It's there's no money being exchanged. There is just literally somebody taking some action to either eliminate a contract or change rewrite the contract. And then the fifth part one of the major Equitable Equitable remedies in contract is specific performance, right? So you do have to examine whether there was a valid contract in place and has the defendant breach the contract or the defendant about to breach the agreement. And if so, you know specific performance you will have to go and go through the various elements so that you can explain, you know for both parties. He's whether specific performance should be granted or whether it shouldn't be granted. So that basically is your remedies. And again, the very first part is you always look to your legal remedies first. And then your Equitable remedies. The second part is you have your legal remedies for torts. Your third part is your Equitable remedies for towards the fourth part is your legal remedies for contracts. And then finally your Equitable Equitable remedies for contracts Okay, so Generally when you get tested on remedies it's going to be in the context of these two subjects that is what the bar includes. And so the more that you can become comfortable with these subjects and how the remedies flow from a result of the various violations that can happen in the context in the context of contracts and torts the better off you'll be in remedies. Okay. So I hope that helps you. I hope that gives you you know a good bird's eye view of how it works. And I look forward to catching you at the next episode. Alright. Take care. Bye.
