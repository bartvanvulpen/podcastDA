1	Welcome to the Glenn Macintosh show. I'm Glenn Macintosh a psychologist who is super interested in eating physical movement weight body image and holistic health in general. I'm talking physical mental emotional social existential and even spiritual health. I'm so glad you found me and soon you'll hear I can talk about this stuff all day and that's really where the idea of the podcast. I'm from I already had my Q&A video series Thursday therapy and my blog 52 thoughts for The Chronic Dieter, which I'm turning into a book called, 'The Insanity so even though lots of people were asking for a podcast I'd kind of put it off for a little while, but then I found myself having these amazing conversations with unbelievably inspiring people groundbreaking scientists and best-selling book authors and world. Is a Visa important social change movement and I'm having these conversations and I'm thinking literally millions of people would benefit from hearing this chat. So I really wanted to share those talks with you and whammo the podcast was born. It turns out that after over a decade of doing blogging and almost half that of videos It's already one of my favorite things to do. I absolutely love it and I'm looking forward to taking this journey with you. The show is based on interviews with like-minded people who inspire me and who share some of my core values of compassion science and Innovation compassion because feeling shame around our challenges is more often the cause of our problems rather than the Cure evidence because I believe science is the best way we can understand what's really going on and how To best support people and Innovation because sometimes the traditional approaches don't offer us all of the answers or even as in the case with dieting potentially do more harm than good. We'll also be sharing parts of my best videos that work in sound only there's just too much awesome stuff there for you. Not to I'm going to share some of the most relevant interviews and presentations that I give when I can and I'm even thinking of some crazy ideas like reading some of my blogs to you as I know that some people prefer to listen rather than read and recording some hypnotherapy that I do with clients so you can listen to it.
