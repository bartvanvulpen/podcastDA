The children were playing with these toy doll it horse things or horses and they had this thunderstorm music playing on Alexa. And for some reason they were shouting save the horses save the dress are just saying that so I thought now's my chance save the Rebellion save the dream and if He looked at me like I was meant to and carried on so that's how I've been but how have you been making mine?	
1	That is a tidy little link and if if they don't know what what is going down with that quote then maybe you shouldn't have them living at your house.

Do you know what that comes in later that comes in or mention it? I'm not gonna mention it. It comes in later to something we're talking about. It's crazy. It's like it's like we have notes or Time for the funk who'da thought who'd a thought I mean notnot that I'm great with them anyway, but mr. Mr. Hardy's much better with them than I am but this week listeners ladies and gentlemen. Galactic Legends, we got something new for you. In fact, it's called the galactic Newsround at a start of every show. We're going to briefly talk about the news that's going around the Galaxy but it's going to be real brief. We're just going to man are going to take turns. We're going to go over to subjects. We're probably not going to talk about them in depth. We might mention I mentioned them later on in the show. Who knows who knows. We're crazy. We're crazies though. Let's smash it. George Lucas set the internet Ablaze by cradling baby Yoda in a photo shared by Jon Favreau the rise of Skywalker passes 1 billion dollars worldwide for also now has the lowest ranked critics are like a percentage on Rotten Tomatoes with 52 percent despite rumors to the contrary the can OB Disney place.

3	a Star Wars sessions podcast launches merchandise details in the band Tina So now to our main discussion what has been firing up the Galaxy this week. What's been tearing everyone apart? Well, my man just a small thing of Colin trevorrow Rose episode 9 script has leaked out. Apparently I say apparently because the only person who hasn't confirmed its legit is Colin trevorrow though. He has been liking a lot of tweets relating to how much people like this script or seem to like it. It's title Duel of the Fates. And before we talk about any of the for any of the script We do what I think about it. This is what the cruel would have sounded like. The iron grip of the first order is spread to the farthest reaches of the Galaxy only a few scattered planets remain unoccupied traitorous acts are punishable by death determined to suffocate a growing unrest supreme leader.	
1	Kylo. Ren has silenced all communication between neighboring systems led by General Leia Organa.	
3	The resistance has planned a secret mission to prevent their Annihilation and for to path to Freedom the dead speak on are wrong. So there's too cruel for that. So we got a limited. So this drops last week. I first heard of it via kind of ramblings and discourse on Twitter who would have thought and I didn't really think much of it. So I went on YouTube in the evening just to chill out and I notice that Robert Myer Burnett good pundit had a video of about this leaked script called Duel of the Fates and I thought all interest and I you know, I trust this guy's judgment that I saw next to it somebody else and other you know, Many prominent Pandit had a video up do love the face script script leaked. That's like we're okay. Oh, I'll have a listen. So listen to what Robert had to say took it all in looked after looked at online afterwards and realize that you know, the AV club another reputable sources are you know, I've confirmed this independently as being legitimate and Colin trevorrow hasn't had to come out and said is if this isn't true like he did last time so as far as we're aware 99% 99.9% sure this is But true this is what this is legit a genuine scripts from Colin trevorrow was going to be called To Duel of the Fates. Now. I've read I've heard the Reddit synopsis and I've read other articles and I read listen to what Robert my Burnett said and I know you have as well so as its kind of Top Line, I know because we're going to get into what we thought about it, but that's a top-line. What did you think when you first heard the details of this?	
1	Um, I'll be honest with you mate the first detail I thought is Duel of the Fates we Hold it yay cold it. Yeah, you wanna names selfish time when we were going over what we saw the title is going to be in one of our earlier shows, which is crazy. Yeah, I'm probably about to a year ago June and the fates is definitely on the cards for four titles. We thought episode 9 could be other than that in summary, and I guess we're going to go into this, you know goes without saying There are bits of it I think are super cool super cool like missed opportunities and there are other bits with that that I am really not digging.	
3	What about you similar to the point? Actually, there's a lot it feels a lot smaller. There's a lot less characters muddying the waters if you will and some of the times I think are so much better, but then there are other things which happen. I think that's really odd all that that feels shoehorned in without any explanation and I know this is a scrip. Screenplay scripts re not a you know, a complete a detailed explanation of description of what happens, but you know what I read this and heard it and I've stood on it. I've gone back to read and I actually thought you know what on on paper because it could translate to the screen different on paper. I think it sounds very good and I'll pay for there's a lot of things I would have rather of seen in this in do love the face and the rise of Skywalker guy as we've mentioned. I was ambivalent to a point to the rise of Skywalker really enjoyed. The Adventurous Spirit of it, but there was so much that Didn't jive with me and not because it I went in with the preconception of what I wanted, but there's things that up to me somewhat and there are things in this which I think actually I would have preferred that but again, I'm going to disclaim that by saying that Colin trevorrow could have put this on and Derek Connolly who also wrote this could have put this on screen and it could have been you know, ten times of terrible. So we've got to say that just because it sounds great doesn't mean it is and I know we've asked you guys what you thought we've got different opinions now. Oh, yeah. Of it. Like you said, I actually quite a lot. There are some things I didn't like but the actual the script itself pretty much sees the resistance heading to Coruscant, but I've got a light a beacon to try and which will send a signal to about 50 planets to rallies more the troops to their cause basically in a in a fight in like the last and final last stand against the first order and that's pretty much it in kylo. Ren is on a self discovery Mission. He goes to different places and raised struggling with herself as The Last Jedi. And that's kind of where our story is and that's the three main parts of it. And as I said, there's a lot of characters who come back from The Last Jedi and ones from the risers go look we were never mentioned at all to me. I think actually this ties up the sequel Trilogy better and actually and actually seemingly provides a better thematic link to the Last Jedi just because of what happens in it, but what about you make so I mean, let's get into what we did like about it's probably the best place to start dude before we go on.	
1	Just want to mention I totally forgot to mention this earlier. But I saw the road Skywalker again on Friday a dodgy little Cinema in I say dodgy. I don't mean that lovely little Cinema in Canvey Island. Yeah, you know, yeah three pounder tickets on your left. Yeah Broski on weekends. It's a fiver but that's still like half the price or more man who like 30 40 percent of the price of you know, the amount of quid you have to cough up at Sydney World, you know.	
3	It's a nice kill Cinemas.	
1	Well that it's a from you is q and it's some popcorns pretty good. So yeah, that is I am going to say this that is fresh in my mind and I do find myself. And I think every time I see this film I am enjoying it more and more a bit like The Last Jedi the more I watched The Last Jedi the more I understood from it the more I enjoyed it and I'm feeling pretty similar with this one. There are missed opportunities, obviously, but um, and obviously that stirs up emotion when we go through this this script, right because there are moments like you are smart some my favorite things going to Coruscant. I Nice snake and it almost felt like the different different layers of khorasan. Like they're building it up more and more. So the layers you go down it gets older and there's obviously like a little rough bit of the planet still as there would be that we kind of get a hint in that in the Clone Wars, but they they go down to like one of the levels of the planet and there are people like there are homeless people about is pretty rough very blade runner-esque and you know, sign me up for that that seems Oh sweet. I love the sound of that.	
3	Yeah Curtis is described as no longer being vibrant the chorus and we've got in the prequels doesn't exist it that level anymore. Now. I really wanted to see a Coruscant bought into 2020 19 with the graphics and the effects that they could have done like you say blade runner-esque his Blade Runner 2049. Look just looks okay.	
1	That is one of the most beautiful films man. That film is stunning.	
3	Right what Roger deakins paper that was Ready before the cinematography had I could have done that with Coruscant. I think it could be it could have been iced the first order of set themselves up that they've got a palace are apparently so we would have actually seen more of a different side of khorasan and it would have immediately given us that those pretty cool feeling so we would have thought right. This is a tie-in this is tying in the how to the prequel trilogy where correspond with such a big deal and I mean they stay open as well on the coup at shipyards and for Geeks Who read the cannon in the dick visual dictionary to coax ship yards away. All of the Star Destroyers are made up from the Empire days. It's a big part of Cannon the kind of like always like unspoken but it's a it's kind of a not well known but it is a pretty decent Deep dive to to be at the coup at shipyards. I like that. I don't know. I like the fact that Palpatine wasn't in it. I'm not from the Hologram but then the Hologram also brings up some problems because the Hologram App helps is what is given Vader some instructions if the boy kills me. Go and make this Geezer called Torv Alum who apparently show talk Palpatine everything. You knew now I'm thinking well right now I'm sitting there saying, you know, I'm still here. Yeah, right.	
1	So there's that maybe they would have explained that I don't know but on paper it does seem a bit odd, but I like the fact that perhaps wasn't in it to that seems it seems crazy because I can see what Collins doing with a lot of these as a lot of mirroring going on like there was a bit where layer like like plug something. Into R2 or something and it's meant an echo what happened in A New Hope and then artuz literally showing us like memories of what's happened in the Saga. You know what he has seen that seems pretty cool. That seems really cool. But again, he's like is it too on the nose? And again like you said like with just so I'm going everywhere but like, you know what you said about Palpatine, you know, like basically setting up Vader to take on his tasks like correct me if I'm wrong, but Doesn't seem like about patina thing to do. Yeah, if he's dead if he is dead something like I'm Cinders going down. Yeah, they are burning they are but he wants the Galaxy to burn if he is dying. He don't want like they dislike being a success. I he don't want no one being a success. I heat he wants to Galaxy to really know who they've messed with right here. Just seems like that tall guy doesn't seem like a guy of old Vader by the way. I've died here. You're in charge now. It's all hunky-dory this guy. I've never mentioned before ya GO train with him. I don't know maybe that that seems like that almost says like feels because there's bits in this scripts the way you like. Yeah, that's that's sweet that makes a lot of sense and then but that is one of those things that feels like a Palpatine thing in episode nine that feels like something that you cannot explain. You cannot feasibly explain unless unless it's Darth Plagueis. That's the only thing I like it white dude why I won't film like why aren't any of These filmmakers talking about Darth Plagueis.	
3	I'm get it if I don't get a kiss I'd be bitter grouped by now that not everyone seemed to at the Galaxy's forgotten all about me. And he said this is a great part about suspect. This kind of chat is was just saying that I'm thinking yeah, why is it why they make never mentioned 12 Alum and our less Palpatine sent Vader there. So this tool vallum can can teach him the ways of immortality to and then he can then bring Palpatine back, but you know the slot Following that plan is Vader's probably like what I want to bring him back. So that's the end of that could think of but that doesn't make any sense. It should just be but you play because I like the actual description of tall vallum. He's like seven thousand year old ghost thing and he's described as lovecraftian in a pre in appearance. I love Karl crafting is kind of this horror of which you can't comprehend that it appear image of which you can't combat Cosmic horror and it sounds incredible I would have After a scene like that kind of a Gothic horror villain in who 7,000 year old is old in Star Wars again could looked awful could have been terrible on paper sounds great. And that's the best thing about this with on paper a lot of it. Sounds great. The what kylo Ren's Journey sounds great where he travels to mr. Farr and where to find out a bit more about what he's doing. He's going to find a holocron and the and Luke Skywalker. Just like I said in the last Jedi strike me. Out and I'll you know, I'll always be with you like your father in this script Luke Skywalker is haunting kylo Ren. It's a direct tie-in to The Last Jedi and you know, he's saying things like this is where the Darth pot leads an empty tomb Kyle. I was like, where did your path lead and and Luke's trying to convince him to go back to layer. Carlos is going to be arm is going to be more powerful than any Jedi. Even you it's back and forward which we were promised in The Last Jedi, but was completely ignored in the the rise of Skywalker. And which is how it which has had so much going on but that was such a big moment. I've come in The Last Jedi when it's like same as everyone, you know strike me down. I'll be more powerful blah blah Luke sent it to Carlo but it never really followed up. And in this script they do follow-up and I much prefer that and obviously the ending is different. We can't have get the force ghosts coming to save Carlo but it doesn't work or bend solo, but it doesn't work. So we get there if we get a failed Redemption, I think I would have preferred that as well.	
1	Really just because it's different. I don't know man. I've seen the Benz solo Montage with the a need a hero. Yeah, they know and that's pretty good. You know, it's pretty good.	
3	Lemon adjuster is sweet. I gotta give him that dude.	
1	I love the Ben solo Redemption. I love the again the Han seen dude. I watched again Friday and I was seeing us I was like damn this that I literally was sent out on this might be one of the best scenes in the whole Saga. I was saying that Friday thinking oh my days, this is crazy good crazy good. I adore it. So when I'm used to that and I've got around to but in him get around to thinking that I've always kind of thought that from from your help tonight, you know reading this script. I'm not sure if I enjoy the Ben solo stuff quite as much rather kylo stuff quite as much it sniffs something. Am I going crazy or is there something about the The Mask like kylo getting another mask made and then it's sticking to his face or something.	
3	Yeah, when he when he tries to open the holocron, which is got Palpatine's whatever in it, the the holocron basically describe blows up and damages his face and then Sorry releases red lightning on to Carlos face and basically stalks his face and and essentially his face is repaired with moose melted Mandalorian armor to Connor as I don't have a stock cyborg face or just gone of I don't I can't picture it. But yeah Mandalorian by his basic. Our armor is used to repair his face.	
1	Here's something mate. Here's something I want to I want to ask you and I want to know. All right, let's look at those dates, and I'm just I'm just like changing the subject that to none. Not necessarily story-based but something else 16th of December 2016. That's yeah, that's a week before Carrie Fisher's death. Yes. Do you think that has anything to do with trevore rohtang? Look it can't be done. It can't be done not this cannot be done.	
3	Oh, this is great care of it. Now this Jewel of the fight script doesn't have an awful lot of carry in it. From what I've read and seen she's in it and he's fairly prominent like towards the end. She she she speaks to Lando. Can you Granny the troops? And then she brings all the all of the forces to Coruscant and we have this massive space and Ground Battle. I would have dug that and Chewy's in an X-Wing by the way, which would have been oddly cool, but And fanservice might be on Fanboy but she's not in it as much as trevorrose had said before because there's a originally said, you know layer this was going to be layers film. He couldn't wait to work with Mark Hamill as Luke but also layer this is going to be her film and it's been and Catherine Kennedy's come out and said, you know, this would have been layers film. Now. This script doesn't doesn't doesn't back that up. I don't think but I can imagine him. I can't imagine it being a part of it. I still think the Fallout from the book of Henry had a problem had a was part of the reason why he's not there anymore. But even then that still smacks of desperation because the book of Henry might have been a critical failure, but everybody has a critical failure even Spielberg's done some Clan is in his time and everybody does a bad course of course.	
1	Oh, yeah.	
3	I think it's that potentially the issue of really caused by the tragedy of Carrie Fisher passing. I don't know. I think I don't know him lucasfilm with the script and just didn't like it because I have been times when students look at a script don't like it and we'll be in the director because the crazy thing is man like and this is what I'm trying to get my head around we spoke to bespin balloon last week.	
1	Yeah and 16th of the 12th. 2016 dude. That was before Rogue one came out. Can you believe that that's crazy a couple day.	
3	It was a couple of days before that came out a couple days of on	
1	Guang came out. So this point we only had one Disney error Star Wars. Yeah, let's die. Let that sink in 1/5 films layer five films later. We are talking about all for free, you know, depending on if you're excluding or including the force awakens, but you get the gist you have like nearly half a decade later and we're here talking talking about this now. Does that line up? Does this script league lineup? With the time that was given to JJ to do episode 9 because it seems like one was trapped Rivero trevorrow.	
3	Let go he was he was bent around not long after this time to be honest. It wasn't because JJ Abrams took over in 2017. I think which only gave him like, yeah, the two years almost to do is to do his work and trevorrow was announced very early on in the process same as Ryan Johnson. So he would have been writing his scripts at a script or the draft would have been written by the end of 2016.	
1	For a 20-19 release so I would have been ready the I was short episode 9 stuff with JJ like what we were talking about with bespin last week was like late 2018.	
3	Janata mean that's nearly two years II remember Colleen being been that I've been in for want of a better term being, you know, let go fairly early between it was definitely between the Rogue one The Last Jedi because there's obviously also those rumors that Ryan And may suddenly take over maybe it maybe it was maybe it later on in. Maybe it's later on in 2017, but I don't think it was that late 2017 because JJ it still took a little while to get JJ on board, but I am going to find out actually while we're talking.	
1	Yeah, okay learn because that's that's an interesting one because it again it seems before we dive in anymore. I'm I'm still questioning and I know I know some people have, you know, kind of validated. This but the how validation in this in this world and we know as people vote for big corporations. We know how sometimes easy it is for a corporate a quote-unquote corporation to sign something off. And actually it's not authentic or it's not right. Maybe there's an error in it. So I am I am still a little bit suspicious of this script something in it doesn't seem right and also if this was the The script or one of the first scripts proposed. I don't see how there's anything really that that would be enough for Disney to to or lucasfilm to get rid of Rivero. It doesn't seem feasible.	
3	This is Hollywood. I guess I could yeah something tells me that by September 2017 trovato had left episode 9 But again also as big businesses do that decision would have been made long before September 2017. They wouldn't have just would have asked him and then announced it it could have been two three four months before that. So yeah, you know crew I rather probably on my baby the end of the first quarter of 2017 maybe coming into court or two of 2017. I imagined but yeah, I it's a strange one and it's it's one of those ones that not even our best been bulletin about to tell us what happened, but we're never going to find out what happens. And I know a lot of people actually get it to the book of Henry others say it was a falling out with lucasfilm and then others say it was due to carry Fisher's passing it, you know, it seems to be a bit everybody has their own opinion and I don't know I agree that it's nothing in. There's nothing in this script that makes me think well Lucas film will have seen that absolutely hated it apart for. Yeah. Well, I pull them apart from the one thing at the end of Stephanie would have hated by think. They would have had a trouble trying to explain it and I'm gonna go to mortis.	
1	Mmm. He just comes out.	
3	The blue is like Ray and kylo get to mortis. Right firstly what I got a mortise. What's there? And what are ya and just like and I know solo but back more spoiler for so the obviously the Canon junkies would have got that and new casual fans would have thought well, who's this guy? He was cut in half in The Phantom Menace. Mortis would be a big deal to explain because it's like a force Nexus is like the it's like the father son and daughter and the home of the force almost won. I think that's like the Wellspring of life. Life, I think it's called but the mortise is that one of the most powerful force planets in the galaxy and you had to expect had to explain why they're there and white what's the point of being there? And we saw in a clone wars that everybody got like heightened powers and is all like a different dimension and that's a bit weird for me and Trinity might not work in a film and maybe they would have been like I maybe they were like, you've got 86 mortise and Colin and Derek Connolly were like, no we really want this we believe in this and maybe that I could do what I think we're there were certain moments which didn't sit well with lucasfilm and then the end they went to Mexico, which is that which I like as well, but the mortise thing I don't know. Other than that, I can't think of anything which is like offencive to lucasfilm.	
1	Now, it doesn't seem like that and and if it is like there are bits in this like again what I mentioned earlier, we've kylos that face effectively get melted onto the mask, which seems crazy anywhere. Like how would you execute don't? Don't don't don't take that bad boy on to the big screen. You're not happy really hard to do. I don't know how they do that. But also it doesn't seem like something that that seems like something there to go light with Colin and I Colin, you know, you know real that one in a little bit like that covid. All right crying. Yeah, Tony that bit down again, but you know, what if he was a reasonable dude, and you know, he seems so, you know, if it was me I'd be like, oh, okay fair enough fair enough, you know, you guys had me And I don't know but maybe it's too much of that. But my yeah, it seems it seems real weird. So some of their so let's be honest. It seems like this film a bit like the Riser Skywalker. It's aiming for a lot and I've tell you one thing dude after my third viewing Riser Skywalker should have been a three-hour film or or a two hour 45 2 hours and 20 minutes. Just another 20 minutes 15 minutes and give me a A plague us lion and actual Plagueis line as well.	
3	Not not a cheeky wink to the audience. Yeah, when I went to difference between this script I think and what we got and again I had I keep saying it but it's just a final draft. It may have changed. It may have been different when it's on screen. But as I mentioned it feel smaller if you didn't have you had the guy the teams because you've got team a and Team B, they're called which I like team team a was basically Rose fin are two and three po Team B was rape. Oh and true. Because it was which I like that and they basically go to places themselves and meet all meet up at the end. But they basically tear a rose finality threepio go to qu act and Pope joins them as well. And then that team goes to Coruscant Team B goes to a couple of planets, which I can't remember the names of now want that they resist resistance base on some I got caught I laugh and that's it. Is this little small you don't have quite as much quite as many new characters being bought in it you It's just a cool characters of the sequel Trilogy, which you know, what I would have preferred that as much as I love. Sorry, I love Jana and all these other people they brought in as well but Babu freak, but I looking at this I prefer I would have preferred a smaller store which is more frantic, you know the shipyards. I got a blow set blow the ship but it doesn't work. They steal a star destroyer that's happened in Canada few times. I like that and then it's basically right you go to Coruscant you go and do that and we'll be in the middle. I like that. It's Not you know traveling across the Galaxy and in 18 minutes. It's a few places and it's more focused and the characters which we we've grown to like in the sequel Trilogy that does include Rose Tico, you know, I'm a big fan of Rose. They would have got they would have got their their screen time, which is the first two films in the trilogy afforded them or in people. Like roses case The Last Jedi, she's fairly big player in that it would have carried on and we would have had to bring in Beaumont. Kin Dominic Monaghan character. You would have had to bring NG in Jannah and band that because they almost felt like they were just doing roses job for her but I like the fact that it was a smaller story with smaller characters. So I like that as well. Plus that the apparently according to Robert Myer Burnett just script. Apparently the humor in it is like proper Star Wars humor the back and forwards between Finn and Poe special and roses and that when they're trying to steal the Star Destroyer on qu act and during it is World a human was well placed and apparently it's like, you know Proper Star Wars humor, but I will say that a rise of Skywalker as we've mentioned nailed the humor, so I'm not worried about that.	
1	Yeah, dude, JJ gets tolls human. He gets Star Wars moments. Yeah, because and and this is one thing I will say is that It's it's I think it's very easy to sit here and say this sounds good. That sounds good. And don't get me wrong. A lot of this actually sounds really interesting. Sounds like it'd be a good laugh and great to see on screen. But that's the thing seeing on screen me the ability to project these ideas onto the big screen is is a whole different ball game it and it and takes on a whole different meaning and it and yeah, I wonder I really do wonder how the how some of this wood would have would have turned out one of the things that I really took from from The Scrub, but I really I really like why I like That I like both of these both outcomes right different reasons. I like that Ray had a family in the rise of Skywalker. And now it's to Palpatine's I buy into that and I don't mind it and then you know, maybe those seeds were sown earlier on in the trilogy specifically the force awakens. You know. Now you're saying are you go back and watch raised fighting style watch the way she she screams and When she's fine eats is very much like a Granddad.	
3	Yeah lines in the novel as well which hit to that.	
1	Yes, Riya a so there's there's bits and Bobs that do really make sense actually and he's right. So then I like that and I can I actually think you can expand upon that in the cannon. However, I really do like in this script Ray remains a a coin coin. No one we actually do find out her surname don't we in this in this script begins of an S. I think or something like that or a Skywalk again?	
3	Is it?	
1	No not quite. It's a smoke.	
3	I don't know what I see.	
1	I heard I heard from a different source. So we find out it's something like kylo ends up telling her that's what if anyone out there knows it.	
3	Let us know.	
1	Yeah, so so anyway anyway in this She still a no one and I like the idea that anybody can come up if the force chooses them and if they go along with it, you know, they they work with the force they work with the will of the force then then you know that you can do right you can you can bring balance to the Galaxy and I like that idea that that was always something that I think Ryan really really explored. Well in the last Jedi	
3	Yeah, and the rate we getting this iteration may have been better suited to have Ryan rotor again conjecture. But array we got in the rise of Skywalker is array one year on from The Last Jedi. We have the Canon of all still stay there raised struggling with her powers and is with her and with her place in the galaxy and we kind of get that in the risers guy will go but at certain times you also do get you know, Ray who's doing 50 foot. Flips over waves and other things but I actually like to re again in the rise of skull which is one of my favorite characters in The Saga. I love Ray, but I would have liked to have seen this re the way he heard and thin have almost like a bond where right things like talking to her about Carlos and you have to you know, gotta shut him out. He can't change and raised like it's never too late to change. You taught me that Finn and it's playing off the amazing chemistry. They had in the force awakens and also Ray and Luke as they try. And because I send them in the actual roster Skywalker roof spoiler review, we did that Ray and Luke their actual like relationship in the film in the last two days is Rocky at best that it really get on will not out of luck. Malice towards each other, but just to situation he doesn't want to leave the island. She wants him to she's obviously strong-willed and so is he and it just they bounce off each other and in this script to know that Ray is Challenging him. He's like balance, you know the dark will suffocate the light the light will extinguish that it comes back and forward. How was that balance and it looks kind of saying when I my father had the same anger, I know what you are know what it's all about and then arrays like so says my master and his master says that in fact a thousand masters of all said the same thing telling us how to live and it's kind of like back and forward as Ray's trying to basically stop being not stop being a Jedi but following that path and the gate and Luke's trying to convince her because he's saying the force of speaking But that again that feels like okay, I would have liked to have seen that as well a bit more of that kind of continuation of her training with Luke and the Luke how we saw him the last Jedi and the Finn and Rey relationship. I like that kind of dynamic because obviously Lucas and also haunting kylo. So a lot of the times in this script work better to The Last Jedi for me from what I'm reading for upon upon reading it. But again, there's the stuff like tall vallum. There's mortis. There's there's other things which don't really tie and I don't really work the converting they were like sideways Plagueis. There's a lot of stuff that doesn't work. I love to Huck's being being now being Chancellor Huck's that sounds perfect. You could have can you imagine Huck's prancing around Coruscant? Just keep telling everyone. I'm Chancellor Huck's Chancellor Hawks his nose in the air. I would have loved to seen Donal get a bit more to do because I think it's great as happy.	
1	Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I I think actually I that was again. I was a bit the script. I really liked again being back on Coruscant seeing that more Blade Runner e type of aesthetic on Coruscant would be sick. And yeah Dom who you know as the chancellor that's cause when it and let's do a blockhead as well.	
3	Carlos still hates him Huck still hates covid as we still got that Dynamic.	
1	Yeah, I like that. I like that and I I actually do prefer that to what we got in the rise of Skywalker again, I don't mind Huck's interest but you know, it gets to see a lot of it. We don't see a lot of spy. I'm the Spy come on. Come on.	
3	And again is it this isn't a batch of the rather Skywalker because we both enjoyed that film.	
1	Yeah, of course, of course my yeah. I'm anyone new to the show it just it there's a lot in this to take in and yet again, it's you know what I'm going to take it back to the Jedi thing they do. Jedi they look into more meaning of what the Jedi is in this film. Don't they and Rise kind of a Crossroads where she's she's not sure if she wants to be a Jedi let alone if she's a Jedi. Yeah. Yeah again, I'm not really sure on that one. It doesn't seem to some of these points don't seem fleshed out enough and they seem to contradict themselves the yeah, so Ray has an argument about no one to do. A Jedi and then like later on in the script she turns around and tells later she trusts her Jedi training, right? So yeah, you've got a little bit of a contradiction there and but obviously this seems like a rough script and we know that but again, it seems like that seems messy in itself and imagine that Amplified because that's what it is. This is just like rough plot points, but I imagine those sort of mistake. So those sort of complications just Amplified on time massive screen and it's a two-and-a-half-hour film.	
3	I don't This is it. Yeah, this is that mean we'll never know.	
1	Yeah, it's just right.	
3	Anyway, thanks for listening guys. See you later. This is called the last draft only because of what obviously Carrie Fisher's passing. Could there be any rewrites where they would have been reshoots and rewrites anyway as is as we mentioned the best been as is standard on massive Hollywood Productions, maybe this script would have had at one more going through and they would have iron those out. Who knows but that is again that's just speculation on top of Elation for what? We have though. Yeah, that's a cool about it is that's a contradiction that's a bit odd and something that had it made it to the big screen would have been sitting there thinking around on 45 minutes ago. You just been telling the greatest Jedi ever, you know, mocking him punking him off and now you're saying actually I love your Jedi training. However is brilliant, you know, I would have been a bit odd type of I mean Han Solo does appear in this film at some point Rose gets captured and tortured I'm telling you that happens. I'm bursting through that screen design. And one of the other things I liked was fin R2 and 3PO. They start like a riot a citizen's upright Uprising on Coruscant a they surround the first orders Palace or Citadel and up the they rally the ordinary folk of the gallic the ones who have been under the oppression the oppression of the first order to fight back so they would have been that where people wanted that Stormtrooper Revolt which we kind of got with Jana and the 71 crew or whatever. They're called 77 crew. Yeah, but this would have had a full-on like citizens Ryan. I don't know what they would had his weapons. But maybe I don't know that would have been quite cool maybe because it kind of would have had a as an end of a saga to have like the citizens of what the one of the most powerful planet or X powerful planets in the galaxy rising up to as a revolution. I think they would have been quite a good cause at the the film's before it showed a Galaxy under the oppression of somebody the oppression of the Sith or the Empire would have separatists or first orders. The font to have a final battle actually involving this ordinary citizens saying no, we finally had enough but in high school one thing we kind of see that in the rise of Skywalker with ships with all the ships turning off and they go it's not Fleet.	
1	It's it it it people that's right.	
3	Yeah, the tablets called another Freedom Fleet. I think they're called something like that.	
1	It's and I again and I kind of dig it. Wish we got a bit more of it again there. Maybe that's why we need that extra few minutes. It's a point on Walker. Yeah. Yeah and Actually, the more you look into this script you can see the maybe this is legit because there are there are things that are taken from that elements are taken from this script that are put into the rise of Skywalker. One of those is like the force healing stuff or the force energy. I don't think it's necessarily called the force healing in this crutch. But again, it's that kind of it builds upon the force and what What's possible from it physically between Ray and and kylo? So yeah, they again that's pretty cool. But then there are some there are some things that seem like they're either ripped off of something else and listen that no stories are truly completely hundred percent authentic because our imitates art imitates life imitates art. That's how humans work and you Struck it down. A lot of these stories are just stories like from or two or whatever from All sorts of towers or books or and yeah, so one of the one of the things again that stood out for me I which I kind of like but it's almost a little bit too on the nose is like the the fire thing is it the fire of the lamp thing that the is like from Lord of the Rings is live from returning the king when they like the actual the like like the beacons like to be correct. Yes. Yes. Yes. It was the same thing. There's like a beacon in the old Jedi Temple. Yeah. Yeah, and it goes To like all the other planets and that's how they use they use that to like help build up the resistance build up the people to fight back but it's a why didn't they do that then? Yeah what I got on it. Why didn't lie ob1 just slip in they'll bail Organa slipping now whoops like a lot blow out a cigarette on that bad boy. Hello there like the biggest one of those bad boys on their Boom the Death Stick and Bosh before you know it the Empire be like damn right? We can't even do anything now told you to take that thing down. Down. Yeah. Yeah, it just seems like that's a little far-fetched isn't that and maintenance on that? Yeah. Not not only is it far-fetched. It just seems like it's a steal from Lord of the Rings like straight up rip off from Lord of the Rings moment in order the Rings as well. Yes, it's excellent. But in that context, it makes a lot of sense. Mmm again, you know, what dude I'm going to bring it back around because there's lots of things that I like and don't like an in this proposal. But it highlights. Once again, once again the necessity that in the future lucasfilm Disney need to plan the trilogy or the set of films better they need to do they need to this just reiterates the fact that we could have got some pretty different endings really and the fact that we got completely different, you know, we it just feels in control. System, it feels inconsistent. And I love these Disney Star Wars films individually, but when you go look back at the prequels, you know for all of you know, the minimum mistakes and silly things that happen in that dude. You can't argue that it was consistent battery that it told I was a brilliant story it when you when you step back and look at a bigger picture the prequels telling Amazing Story or even visually they all look the same because it even the fact that Menace which was shot on film.	
3	And clones and Sith were shot digitally but they still have that same like visual aesthetic where you not where you look at one in like right. This is part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy is like 789 they all look new but they all look a little bit different like the color palettes are different and I actually like that Force awakens is very yellow the right last one was very red. And as a very sky like blue hue to the roster sky like that but like this at that just because there's different directors at the Helm of the Different directors but George Lucas was omnipresent. He was there he pretty well as you've said and we've all said he pretty much directed Return of the Jedi from this from the Shadows like Palpatine for no, I agree. They didn't Richard do it. They needed to they need bat and if their heart the whole Republic or whatever's coming next has to learn from these mistakes because it is a mistake to meet they did not they did not plan this cheerleaders out better. But again, I'm pleased with what we've got. Not so before before we go anywhere. I've got three things out of this script, which I wanted to throw at you as well.	
1	Shoot.	
3	The first one is Ben Solo or sorry. Sorry. Kylo, Ren actually killed Ray's parents. What do you think about that?	
1	Because they were nobodies that's know how to do it. Yeah. I part of me says yeah, I kind of like that tragedy and then another part of me says but wouldn't know that be mentioned in the last July. I don't know. I'm kind of indifferent about it. Yeah, sorry lame like an extra one.	
3	Right and kylo in this film. They are basically fighting against preconceptions of what they should be. So raised, you know, she seemed to be a Jedi Carlos the supreme leader and Vader's grandson, but are fighting against that rather than embracing it more. What do you think about that as well?	
1	I I kind of like that. I kind of like that and I but again that's an element that's taken or not. We don't know but it that is an element. We see in the rise of Skywalker Don't Be Afraid of who you are. But yeah, I I kinda like it in this one. I'm going to say it's it's loosen it needs it needs more building on but it I I dig it. I kind of dig it.	
3	Yeah, I think that answer as well. Also Carlo actually satyrs Vader's mask in this which is really symbolic as well, which would have been quite cool to see. Yes. So the two big questions now, you know, it's a roll of drums get the music going. This is what we've all come to hear firstly. It's no Babu freak how you feeling bro.	
1	Babu is like our boy any like, you know, let me tell you something man, like and it A little anecdote. And and don't forget your ask me. Another question in young is I want more - I've got I've got one more. Yeah. Yeah, it's hopes. I will come out to have about yeah, but I just want to mention this. Yeah. So on Friday a few of us went and I promised to take my auntie with us. Now. My auntie is autistic. She has like the mind of a like a three or four year old, but she's well into her blood 40s 50s. I think I don't know alok. Yeah, but But anyway, so but she loves film she loves Cinema and she loves Star Wars and I tell you what made she flipping loved the rise of Skywalker Darth, like absolutely adored it and Babu frick was a huge part of that is she loves she loved the camaraderie of the of the main people the jokes and whatnot. Kylo, right. Let's you can tell she loved that about but Babu Frick she was she was going crazy. I just know for a fact if she sees a Babu Frick toy or little like Teddy thing she is going to go crazy for that crazy for that. But yeah mate like that is one thing that seems to be missing and I know you've mentioned about the humor already that it was going to be like OT style humor. Ot Ot. I'm I'm it seems like a film that needs a Babu frickin it. Okay. So yeah, I'm freaking I loved Babu mate. He's great.	
3	He's a video for YouTube could basically put Babu Frick into every film possible. I want to see The Godfather with Babu frickin it The Story Toy Story Toy Story. Maybe not in this list, but Toy Story. Yes.	
1	Happy prick. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one you know, the the genocide film.	
3	Yeah. Yeah that hilarious film the final question for you. Yeah Master Bly Walker and also any of all these new characters. There isn't any Bly pans, which is slightly annoying.	
1	That's kind of my your job harder and out.	
3	So, mr. Garza Skywalker. The only pun is a title the rise of die Walker. So the question if you make for rather Scott Walker versus dual to the face, which title Do prefer episode 9: Bosh?	
1	That's a hard one. I think I prefer Jeweler the fight. You know, that dude. Is it too on the nose of this named after a song from episode one?	
3	It could be a yet again. It could it be seen as that.	
1	I mean how many people would realize that other than the fans not a big fan of you know it I guess I dig it. I did it. Yeah, it is on the ticket.	
3	Yeah, because there are Skywalker the title itself. We were because I'm were talking about what could it mean and I still don't see what Skywalker rather then bends. So got Ben solo rising out of the pits and X ago. I don't see which Skywalker Rose in that film.	
1	I think it's more people.	
3	I mean, I know it's made I guess it's made to be reg was Daisy Ridley even said it's answered in the final scene, but I mean really really The the minute you think of Skywalker you think Luke Anakin layer been so low now probably forgotten someone else that's that's kind of what you think of and I didn't know and race Kyle could it doesn't feel like a rising off Sky walk with me only because we know she's them several things right?	
1	It's with the help of Luke Skywalker the Galaxy Rising thanks to Luke Skywalker. It's the resistance Rising. Thanks to Ben solo the Blood relative of the Skywalker family Heroes. He rises literally out of the cave out like that after he gets heated after that. That is he comes out of that hole boom, right like tingling at the end. Yeah. You've got the right rise rise rise rise, and it's and you know, she is the representation of the Skywalker. She her only family. She's had for the last few years for the for the Important bit of our life because our life wasn't a life before hand her life was getting up and and going in working for these portions. That's it. That is it that is not a life that ain't living I live in was with Luke it was with layer. It was of harm. It was with Ben it was her friends.	
3	So all of that is a symbolization of Skywalker, but is it symbolization of that or Jedi? Because at the end she says and I all the I therefore the rise of the Jedi would have been quite a cool title on the nose.	
1	I am yeah. Yeah on the nose II still I prefer I prefer Jewel of Fates by see how how rise of Skywalker makes sense because it's it's a it's an ideology as well the, you know, maybe the Jedi in the future are called Scott Walker's or something. We don't know. Well, you know, we'll find out about five circles. I see your point. I see ya.	
3	One time to do it the Luke one obviously inspiring the Galaxy. Nobody came on crate and we know that afterwards no afterwards that you know, we saw the key to playing but it still took Lando to go and Kroll the troops. Nobody was coming to the resistance a resistance. Reborn even does that as well that nobody still people still aren't coming to the resistance is Aid and so was Luke's sacrifice in vain because I didn't really build on it and it will it will it will it inspired enough people to effectively rebuild a resistance.	
1	Yeah light not dance at the end of The Last Jedi that's you guys would have a camera on the end of the end of The Last Jedi. There's like 12 people in the rise of Skywalker as hell of a lot more people and like you said, we see the kids at the end of the last show that's very symbolic of the younger generation listening to that and yeah, maybe it all these people did hear about this and it did take a like a literal person to go like You know that Luke Skywalker stop night last real that is real and I know the place where we need to go. It's in the outer regions. Follow me and they're like, okay cool. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I would take out a titles out of titles. I think Joel of face is better but looking at the scripts and looking at the rod the script and riser Skywalker from what we have seen, you know, give me out of the to give me a rise of Skywalker the answers Palpatine better with would really with Plagueis + 10 15, maybe 20 more minutes sold sold. Yeah answering Palpatine answering the Palpatine thing and just fleshing out the the the the	
3	Story a bit letting the story breathe dude, Game Changer complete Game Changer Carnegie that apparently broom boys supposed to be in this film was like a one shot of broom boy. Oh, yeah. Yeah part of the app price and I imagine which is having quite cool. But that again the fun part of this is is this also spoke injector because we'll never know because this this trip then I never been filmed and ever going to be like a splinter of the Mind's Eye where they make a book about it and it's not gonna be like that but An Innovative assistance wins in the first all our losses. So that's what we need to know. So no, I prefer Duel of the Fates as well. Just because you know, the jewel that Duality the fates of the Tui could really literally tie that into the characters as well. I think as well. So I agree with Duel of the Fates as well. So yeah, that was what we thought about it as well when I was really interested to get your opinion on this because I know you're extremely level-headed where sometimes I'm prone to look at something and go blah blah. It is amazing. I'm glad that we had a few days to sit on it rather than shining out last night because again that I actually really quite enjoy this as a script, you know, it's an entertaining read to imagine what would have happened. How would have been on screen? Who knows?	
1	But yeah, I was really really short looking forward to getting what you thought Mike nice absolute pleasure man, and it hey, it's been jokes, you know like it and I'm sure we'll bring this up in the future to smokes his jokes. You know, he boy.	
3	Hey, what's up?	
1	Its Taylor Gray AKA Ezra Bridger and you're listening to Star Wars sessions.	
3	Probably Britain's greatest Star Wars podcast. I hope you enjoy the show. Right? We've got we've had a discussion about the Raza Skywalker the title did it mean anything versus Duel of the Fates? I'm parts now. I need a drink. Let's go into that dirty little drinking hole over there. So I let's do it beef cake bar man to kefb is please.	
1	Yeah. New calf beers and let's avoid getting a drink over our those whose right so as a pole across all of our socials. We asked what your guys reaction was to if taika waititi get the next Star Wars gig 94.7% 94.7% would be up for it with only five point three percent. Saying they wouldn't be down with it. Basically 95% of you guys said taika waititi known for Thor Ragnarok JoJo rabbit more recently. He's directed episodes of the Mandalorian. He voiced IG 11 help me out the world of people think for the world of people who I think what we do in the shadows so during the thing I was going to say earlier on in the show in the intro was that actually I watched Ragnarok I as you know, you film it I am not the biggest MCU guy, but I wanted to watch this because of the news about tigers. I was like, you know what it's been recommended to me like a hundred 1 times. I need to give this a listen or if I listen look at me and my podcast head. I need to give this a watch lad. I need to give this a watch I'm and hey I enjoyed it. It's alright. It's alright - sure about but um, yeah, I enjoyed it and I think teichert I covid Star Wars again though, bro. They need to figure out a plan. They need to figure out a plan because we get we add some capable directors with the sequel Trilogy and and they were they were cable when they met they made amazing products in their own, right but bro, they need to be they need to figure it out thinking man.	
3	I got here. I'm guessing this would be a standalone film. Would it be the Kevin feige one, but they work together. For if you want taika waititi go watch hunt for the wood of people go check out JoJo rabbit to magnificently good films. JoJo rabbit has the humor the irreverence heart emotion the weight the depth. There's a couple of scenes in it, which are just like are fantastic. I like superb and I were still outside. I want to support if anyone and seeing if I watched it. I got it 10 out of 10, although it's super hot, but just because it gave me everything I wanted because when you think about the original block pull synopsis, you think that's a bit iffy room. Not sure how that's going to play out. But you know taika waititi handles it with a Grace of respect and the right amount of finger-pointing when need to be but there's a particular scene about 2/3 2/3 of the way through which is just like it feels like you just been kicked in the gut it's so well done as well and hunt for the will the people is a great sort of smaller Independent News that kiwi Phil. Begin full of Heart full of Hope full of humor it's great. They're two films. I'd say to watch as well and he's Mandalorian episodes. He showed that he could he get Star Wars and I know a lot of people weren't overly enamored with the kind with the Stormtrooper gags at the beginning know that but I thought his episode a fine up to them and I thought he bought it.	
1	Yeah, ma'am. Yeah, dude the dude is so incredibly capable incredibly capable. This is a sword dude. You want it like in on the Lucas? On team. Yay. This guy is a rising Talent. No quick Rising Talent. So let's get him on board.	
3	That's that's what that's what I reckon 95% if you said the same as well. Yeah, that's across all the socials which is which is mad. So yeah. Thanks guys. And so what do you guys end we all know you're the best listeners and the Galaxy we say if you're weak we believe every week because you are what did you guys think of the trevorrow script for Jewel of the Fates end buki boy, take us away. Well,	
1	Oh, well, well, well, well, we got a busy one this week. We got space cookie mum who starts us off by saying seemed as much of a hot mess as the rise of Skywalker. We got I'd love to know what Ryan Johnson had imagined for the end of the story. I bet it was elegant and actually hopeful and mr. J 86ed thought it was rubbish to be honest. I'm very happy with how things turned out film finds.	
3	Anonymous went up. Diamond GIF and start with epic and the starboard's podcast said it's so strange that this has been leaked. So soon after the movie has come out. There are Skywalker almost like trying to put the boot in while critics are still being negative about the film interesting Patron.	
1	Renegade six killer wasn't pleased. He said first draft in particular was awful lacking emotion. No Lucasian themes not a saga ending Patron Lady of the Wolves said I thought let a woman right? It's a star war and Emily Bona I did I got a stomachache because I liked it so much.	
3	Damn. No, it's really good six killer went on the tweets and Unleashed a torrent of victory over towards this which is very entertaining a very well-written. I suggest you guys. Check it out jump hyperspace said better than the rather Skywalker d-10 VX said the force foodie went with there are pros and cons some things. I liked. I was I thought were awful overall JJ's. I was better as students and said great way to end the song with meaning not overdone with fanservice.	
1	Yeah, nice. He said Lucas trolley said lots of cool ideas, but it comes down to execution. Well, so I don't know who's episode 9, I would like more they've done said I prefer what we got loved rise, not perfect, but Looks like we got the good deal continuing on that. The slaver said I liked Finn story and Rhino body.	
3	But other than that, I didn't like what I read interesting and you mother son said I like the sound of it and how it follows on from The Last Jedi at the same time. It's all about how its executed on the big screen. Dark. Dildo said I would love to see aspects of used in other Star Wars stories, but it felt smaller than the writer. You to write the only one set us a muscle arm and burger emoji. Thanks for that guys again and nasty cat 18 said I like you meow. There you go. The nurses are now one.	
1	I mean it just got a bit weird at the end there didn't it muscle on burger emoji and nasty cat 18. I like you meow. And of course, I think it's I think he's also kiwi like taika waititi. Daffy dildo collection is what is spelt with a why people d y El Tio dial.	
3	Yes, the only one who sent us that muscle arm and burger for the last full week. So I thought Definitely get you on and nasty cat. Well, we like YouTube. So put your tuck you in there. You know what I got from these comments and thank you everyone and it again we as we say there was a ton more. So for those who we couldn't get to thank you and do keep sending them in because we will get your feature you on the show. What I will say is this is an awfully mixed bag of responses. Mmm, which is which is yeah. I would have loved to seen a pole on which one did you prefer because I reckon he'd have been very tight.	
1	Yeah. I do know what I think you're right. I think it would be pretty. Tight and myself. I'm still letting it settle in. I think I'm leaning towards Riser Skywalker. But an extended rise to Skywalker. That would knock it out the park Jinan. I mean like we don't know how much was cut out there trust. Maybe they were like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know I'm going in circles.

My question is which 3 Star Wars games are your favorites and possibly deserve a remake after Anna's and before PS2 that is mine are three Rebel assault to PS1 2 episode 1 racer on the N64. And number one is Rogue Squadron on the N64. Those are for Filth filth options. I bet my brother is loving that my brother is willing to get her games dude. Take us away.	
3	No muss three of yours good question, not for another time. But for now, I would got II like Heroes I would actually I would also take episode 1 racer in 64 not to steal your thunder Fad in but I'm going to I like I really like Episode One race and I think that could be that could be done for a remake masters of Tara scalzi PS1. The game itself was a bit naff. Was taken but with updated Graphics proper mechanics and maybe tweak the nafs' story. It could be a fun spin on the Star Wars games will get into the minute Force Commander which came out on Windows. I think same as above could be a sweet game. If you add in if you get rid of the cam is the original plots I put in and add in some like Cannon plots like they did with the Battlefront 2 campaign. I think it'd be good. It's another Imperial defective story, but it's a big Galaxy. So why not? I'm also going to check out coat or as well. Imagine coat all with new mechanics and 2020 Graphics. I think that would look pretty sweet. It looks good enough as it is, but into today, I think it would look out of this world.	
1	No, dude. Those are some spicy Legends and yet it's bro tote or do a coat or remix. That would be absolute filth. That would be really ambitious. But I'd love to play it. Okay. So for me one of the ones that that come straight to my mind mostly It's one of the first games. I think I remember playing on my own and working through and it's actually The Phantom Menace Game on Playstation 1 that game was so sweet. So sweet on Playstation One plan that and my brother played it too because we shared the PS1 we shared the console. Yep our bro. So spicy so spicy. Honestly, I'm going to say this is A cheeky. I'm not sure if I can get away with this. I want to say what what am I going to say?	
3	One of the battlefronts bro? You know me.	
1	Yeah boy, you know what I'm gonna be drill cheeky. I'm gonna say all of the battle fronts for one reason or another but from 1 and 2 and then Battlefront one and two because I remember being in like 2005 and discovering. I thought I'd discovered quote unquote discovered this Crazy Star Wars game mama, I was with my mom shopping. We're at Sainsbury's and I remember the day I write clearly remember the day that we went into Sainsbury's which is a supermarket here in the UK and I went to the games Iowa and there was a Star Wars game called Star Wars Battlefront. And it said in the bag is said I could I could fight in the battles and I could ride in the in the vehicles. I was thinking to myself. I was like what every kid's dream what I could could not but leave it. I remember playing battle from one that week and I couldn't believe how fortunate I was. I thought this game is cray. This game is crazy good crazy good and my love for the battle fronts of has been strong ever since and it's same that continued with Battlefront 2 when that came out the following year. I think that's 2005-2006. That was so sweet. That was so Sweet plan that plan those games and even the modern ones. I have such fond memories of playing the modern ones. Even the most recent one Battlefront 2. I was playing that a little bit last night so so good so good. So yeah, and then last but not least. You know what mate go on you guys you guys going to be think our Luke. He's going to take it vintage now my it's got befallen order.	
3	Oh,	
1	Fallen automate sick sick Fallen order is so naughty. So normally I write that game. I really rate it. Yeah.	
3	Well I misread the question is well how I thought I thought the question was which one's should have get should get a remake. Oh, man, which ones are your favorites? Yeah, man, Battlefront to the original battle fronts and fooling all of the best Star Wars day, but I again Carnegie with coat or for the breadth of scope for the imagination. The impact its had but fall in order for me just because I absolutely Doug the story.	
1	We also need a strategy game. I know there was one I think there was one it wasn't super popular. But we we need a Star Wars strategy game. That would be so sick.	
3	I miss the days of Lucas art without as pumping games out. So obviously now it's very its Cannon Centric and you have to adhere to that which I love but there also is kind of strangle some of the Creator's where you can't just say. Oh, let's let's put out a strategy. The game because he has to go through levels of pain levels of story group and all that now to make sure it is to establish Cannon again, which is a good thing, but do kind of miss the days where you could just get a random Star Wars game about anything and you knew it and you know, it probably we know it was Cannon back then bro as well.	
1	Have you seen like the trend online that people have that avatars as Lego Star Wars have you noticed that I haven't noticed that no, I've seen obviously looks Summerfield wonderful Lego	
3	Photography but I've never actually see I'm at Sea noticed in on Bray.	
1	If you if you look at us are reading this apparently is from Tick-Tock like someone one of the guys from so, you know, like Tick-Tock. Yeah, like the app like this social media thing. Yeah, you know that has become one of the biggest social media platforms are ever. Yeah, like it's crazy big and apparently it's a no too much while this I'm apparently like some of the biggest Tick-Tock has their gold live in this house in LA or something and One of them just put as that Avatar and Instagram or Tick-Tock. Sorry as like one of the Lego Star Wars characters and then everyone in the house did it and then like loads of people on Reddit we're doing it and those people and Tick Tock then loads of people on Instagram started doing it and long story short like that. If you go on Instagram, you will notice little Lego avatars of Star Wars characters surrounded by a blue circle and it is everywhere like we're like, it's become like a trend on all of the Internet. It's mental like I look for this mate. Yeah Broski your now I've mentioned it look out for it in the comments and stuff and you'll be like what what is going on here? So yeah, that's been a funny little Resurgence from that time forward report on that little little little snippet of goodness.	
3	Always there the galactic newsdesk there. I want I want a Lego figure of yourself and me made a Star Wars sessions and they made me do it anybody do Do it do it for us and will be forever grateful Vadim. Thank you for that inmate and everybody at the listening. Let us know what your favorite Star Wars games I'm ones which maybe could do with a little rework as well. Finally. We got a pool Buckle the man who could rock it are to tuxedo. He said here's a question for you regarding the Mandalorian. We all love Rogue one. Yes, we do. Do you think that the finale of the Mandalorian has a link to the files in scary? If do you think this has always been about moth Gideon? Anyway looking forward to a spicy? T20 and I really love this question first because we do all of Rogue one because the best Star Wars ever made, but I really like this it will time but you what did you think about this one? Mate?	
1	Um, yeah, I think that is again that's not something that I realized or or necessarily deeply thought about until Paul mentioned it to us. So do I think it could be a link? Listen mate? I think the Mandalorian and I'm sure we're going to do an episode about this. Yeah. It deserves its own. In topic, but it out, but that's why but let me continue Char bloke the Mandalorian. Has the ability and I think the potential to answer a lot of questions and plot threads plot points potholes in the whole of Star Wars particularly the sequel Trilogy. We're talking Rogue one. We're taught we're talking. Yeah, Maz having the Skywalker saber saber. Like we don't know how that happened. Guess who's going to answer it? Who do I think it's gonna who's gonna Once that you asked Paul Matt. Yeah, it's going to be the Mandalorian. The Mandalorian is going to answer that because the Mandalorian is killing it killing it.	
3	Yes, I can't argue that.	
1	Yeah, I think it's hope that's a great point. No great point. Oh, yeah.	
3	Yeah, we'll say we'll say it's a good point because gin which is going through it too fast hyperspace tracking navigational systems stellosphere packs are or a marker Mega. I remember them cluster prism warm at though Stardust black saber. Rogue ones written way before the Mandalorian and but Pablo and the story of group confirmed long tank is on a star will show and confirm that all of these things. I've just mentioned were added later in the writing process of the script was written and they actually added so so can we have warm at the wing come we have cluster prism and all that. So they so they added them in so they could pay off later down the line in future story. So why not the hyperspace tracking paid off big time in The Last Jedi dinner? So mentions it in Rogue one hyperspace tracking the Empire trying to do it. Couldn't do it the first sort of took that and made it. So I'd love to fix a link and why not? Yeah, the dark side was a black saber. Maybe it maybe Empire trying to get a hand on it as a show of power or or dominance or just to study it's working. So I like to think it isn't I want to find out what Mark Omega is because that sounds weird, but I don't see one out. I think it's a good find and yeah, I'd love to find that the empire were trying to study the darksaber. Yeah, actually one of the files and that's and at in fact, oh Gideon was the one he did it.	
1	Yes spot on that is totally a way they could weave it in and I could definitely see him doing that dude.	
3	Definitely spell spot on are going to watch Rogue one after recording tonight. I'm going to water again for that the 19th time this year. So yeah, thank you very much for that guys.
