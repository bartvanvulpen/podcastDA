1	I know I know anybody because I'm trying I'm trying to get like that. Just me Jack Black Jack Buck.

2	On that note. Yes, this podcast is co-hosted by myself. My name is Royce and the legendary comedian Sinbad and Jack Black and Jack and Jack black man. So this is episode 11.	
1	Yes. Oh man Thomas move. Again.	
2	This time is time is moving Target because we started this podcast like June.	
1	Yeah, Jim looks like there was a giant podcast with me you my daughter and my nephew we have Byron did to her fiance. Yep. That's a big Up there. I think we're cheating them. They don't know we're doing these without them. So hey, we're doing some other podcast without them. Just something not here right now. We will be we will be coming back to using them right now with two people is so easy.	
2	It's a little bit simpler. It's a little bit. We have them already we have into our yeah of our podcast.	
1	Yeah.	
2	Definitely. I'm less channels. We have to worry about which definitely helps. But so let's just let's just jump into some stuff obviously wouldn't be blurred Empire. We didn't talk about some text Black Nurses Association. There we go, and it wouldn't be us.	
1	Yeah, if we didn't talk about Apple to make apples are several consider some stuff to they happily some reason things to out of the 16 inch chain with a six-inch.	
2	Do you want to send us some of that new Mac Pro that just came out?	
1	That's have you seen the prices on those but we know where we sat in tripped on it when we're not tripped. It's it's it's worth the money if you're using for the right reason a lot of people like to look at that give apple crate for some people just like I looked and they lost to my peoples eye. Hurt you. What was it? I've got to get that new Mac Pro. Say what you do it. Well, I have a I have a podcast. I laughed so hard. I saw I can't wait to buy that. Yeah your podcast exactly.	
2	So for those who don't know Apple just released to order today. They now September but they release to order today their new Mac Pro, which is their new upgradable Mac computer kind of like the pretty much gone back in time with the old g-series. Yes Max the glad you And then five years before the g3s with the G5, I believe being the last one where you can actually upgrade put some more memory in their hard drives upgrade the RAM where we all know as far as Max in IMAX and all that stuff go whatever you buy that's pretty much what you got you work with upgradability on them.	
1	I always use my boys OWC other worlds other other workers. Yeah.	
2	Yeah, you do that or you can build a Hackintosh.	
1	Yep, and I'm not a hick. It's not I'm not I'm not I'm not a Mac enstein kind of guy that can stay. You do fans, you know, I mean, I mean some people get off of that. I think it's what guys what you more nerd herd than me that like to build things like to take apart improve the Mac that they could do it, but I have no need for that.	
2	Yeah. So the Mac the Mac Pro's bringing back the you know, the Mac Pro's of of old so you can now customize it as far as how much RAM you put in there you have up to like a terabyte of ram if you just go crazy $3,000 machine.	
1	No, no, no 60,000.	
2	That's with everything is so that the base price is 53 the base well as probably without like the screen and all that's right was that was famous? Yes, the basic cells now the screen. So the base price of the Mac Pro is five thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars so that but you get you get a core processor. I'm not sure how much really yeah the world that's big.	
1	So that's just the base model, but that base model of a Mac Pro.	
2	Is what most people would actually be able to use and actually get some great quality out of it.	
1	Now, obviously, of course this is when they say Pro this is the first time in a while where it actually meant profesh you're saying, you know crazy when I see the price of your home go crazy on the price for these are guys are doing special effects pushing a lot of audio even are your knees much you doing a lot of video when you do a lot of graphics and you're pushing the speeds and the size and the minimum that you need. This is like back in the day. We have the SGI silicon Graphics machine sitting in the size of a big bathroom. Now, you've got that in this this Mac Pro. Yeah, and it's a beast machine. It's really a it's worth it for what you're doing if that's what your company is doing. If you bought because you want to trip and say I've got this which will be a bunch of mac people who do the trip thing. Yeah. Exactly. You know what you you still got something to free podcast for your two channels.	
2	Yeah, if you're just doing YouTube content podcasting all that. Stuff pretty much like, you know the normal type of editing for video creators.	
1	You don't need this Mac Pro, but watch Apple give watch every give one of those machines one is like, you know, you know what you know what they already are.	
2	I don't think they can keep them but they do have them, you know, what test unit sometimes you know, but see if we keep doing this then we can be those people but we do that we can do that didn't I was with Max is 84 that's what I can claim that's been with you since the beginning.	
1	You know, what's with those when you left there was with you when you came back.	
2	Let's remember that net we have to do an episode just talk about your Macos right apple has a journey because a lot of people don't know about that. So we'll save that. There was have a new witness on would say, oh, I'm not gonna talk about my family to my stuff away from my 128 again again in another episode of we don't have yeah, we don't have time for now. All we have time to talk about is if you stack this thing to the maximum maximum graphics cards maximum maximum memory 28 core processor. However, many Case of storage a hard drive storage all that stuff you Max it out and then you get the pro display XTR monitor, which is a completely separate price at 4990. That's when you say the other car.	
1	Yeah, it's soda first car to get the math. Yeah, my son. Now you selling your other car get screen.	
2	The monitor itself is $5,000 $5,000. Now if you actually want if you wanted it to actually stand on something. Oh, then that's an additional thousand dollars thing. That's right the monitor if you want to get them on. It doesn't come with a stand. Yes. So if you just bought the monitor on itself, you would have to mount it on a wall or something like that.	
1	But as a child you have a small child or small he got voted for you it up while they're working.	
2	So all that stuff including if you wanted wheels on your Mac Pro to do, you know, push around and all that stuff.	
1	That's an additional $400 all you could jack somebody shopping cart wheels or whatever. Yeah, just get some of those there's something put a shopping cart still the shop every volunteer somewhere and just push it.	
2	Around that way.	
1	So I need groceries.	
2	I just showed you mine out Vaughn's can you sponsors cage sponsors Vaughn's so with all of that that would equal out to sit a $60,000 system.	
1	I can't wait to get it. It's going to be great. Yeah, I'll have no money left and I can't wait to gauges which is crazy because you know, I am I am going to get a one of those machines and upgrade. I think you're getting more for Christmas, right? If someone wants to buy me one big family Christmas, so, you know because this year we're not doing a big would you say this before on this blurred when? Doing a big Christmas it well. I'm trying we've been trying to do this my wife and I've been trying this for the last maybe 10 years of Christmas where we just take care of people who really need presents and then something happens in our family.	
2	Well because the problem is everyone's like no one do gifts. Yes, and then the day of someone's like hey, I got you a gift and then we're like you knew you were going to do that. So I got you a gift to you jerk or Pages like this.	
1	I'm not doing that. We're gonna celebrate Christmas if a guy doesn't care.	
2	So yeah, we just have to get to the point where no one if someone wants to get somebody a gift that's	
1	Fine, I'm doing it. There's the other person doesn't feel ready to pop this frustrated. If you'll give me something like this, right? I told you I'll give me anything and it won't be that surprised all of us. I guess you like Ryan get you anything. Yeah. We're the only other end.	
2	It's like we're you don't feel insulted where it's like, oh, you got me a gift after you said we want to know what I want so bad at all. How dare you I will not feel bad. Yeah now I think this is the year of just not feeling bad and I agree of just, you know, taking care of the people who really need those gifts who don't have the opportunity to do that.	
1	So we might end up doing one gift.	
2	Person see that's how it starts. We just went from no gifts that you like because he thinks you have something the truth.	
1	I hate it. I hate it naked triangle.	
2	We can get fake kiss. We could just get boxes and wrapping money. That's interesting on time.	
1	It's always say always say all this is forever. I just get one gift one gift if there's something somebody really wants right. That's cool. Isn't it comes multiples because you get one too like oh and they could use this very rare, but I should just send one thing that they want. Uh-huh.	
2	Yeah, cool. We'll see how that goes.	
1	Well, I if I do it I if I do give a gift only one per person one per person.	
2	Okay.	
1	All right, y'all giving each other then this could give each other gifts for you.	
2	But I mean as long as everyone feels comfortable getting me something and I'm good but since we're on the spirit of Christmas, yes, I felt it only rights to because I'm actually curious. I don't even think I know what what's your favorite Christmas movie?	
1	Wow. I can't say one in. Well, that's my favorite thing.	
2	I've done that's my favorite Christmas movie that I've done in white and you what are you going to actually clear?	
1	Are you talking about the way that's done face to go all the way your favorite Christmas Miracle on 34th Street will always be a classic as a kid that meant so much to me. I didn't realize that was symbolizing the Republican party not playing. I'm trying to think man. Is there a Christmas movie I can tell you mine? Is definitely hands down the Grinch the Grinch and the Grits, you know, blessed doctors. That's that's to me.	
2	And yeah, yes, I their suit it is it it's Christmas and I don't know what it is like ever since that movie came out. I just yeah, that's one movie. I can watch a bajillion times and just not get tired. I don't know why I know there's a bunch of other great Christmas movies. I have better stories. But Jim Carrey as the Grinch was literally was a greatest thing ever. I feel like it doesn't get enough credit for that.	
1	You know, you're right. He destroyed me. Yeah, I'm sorry. I loved a great it was a great time. Do Christmas variety shows were in its hands anymore? Do they used to do it? Yeah. Oh God. Yeah Christmas specials were big because of its own. So Christmas song so really I did one really Christmas with the Winans family. I was the missing Winans really from all the singing Wines in Detroit. I was the missing - because I just want to be in the family because I want to be able to sing night. What year was that man in the night early 90s, really?	
2	Yeah. Wow, I didn't even know that.	
1	Ninety said yes. Okay.	
2	Nice. Well one thing I do know though and Brought it up jingle all the way. I think it would be cool to actually talk about since you know, we're in the holidays were in Tim Allen Santa Claus.	
1	Oh, that's a good one too. First. One the first melon Santa Claus is solid. I knew there was one man looking at one solid Tim Allen Santa Claus was like that one. First time. It was a totally different take on it. Yeah, he was a guy that knew it was Santa Claus start gaining weight. Now that is true. That was yes fact that.	
2	Yeah, that's classic. That's classic. That's a good one. That's a good one.	
1	Oh, I might want to know no, I'm sticking to the daily sales anyways. It's close right here.	
2	It's but yeah, I just I thought it would be cool to talk about your experience with jingle all the way because obviously this is the time of year where everyone's hitting you up. Like I'm watching jingle all the way. My friends are always like oh, yeah. I'm watching all the way and all that stuff people come up to you ask you about it, and and I realized that I never really had a conversation with you kind of like about the whole experience of it's just something I always knew you did what part of but I thought it'd be cool to actually talk about how that Then got started because it what it came out in 96 97.	
1	Would you probably have damaged memories 98 you're probably damaged. I am damaged for reasons. We'll get into what we we will get into that fight.	
2	Yes, but I mean just like, how did he even get started?	
1	Okay. I'm shooting first kid in Virginia to tray that how to sail Lou is his name is Lou is Agent that was on It's agent and he was a big fan of mine and Cantonese. Hey, man, I'm trying to convince. These guys are getting do this Christian because I don't want to do a comedy. So we do a Christmas movie and they were looking at a man from Oak Hill Street Blues and couple other actors and I want you know that list and he saw Arnold there's a guy he's a big guy that you can kind of tussle with fight with and be funny because he can make you funny says that's what you want and he pushed them too. Well that director in the look at me. Okay, and the company to look at me, you know Christopher Columbus company. So it was it was it was weird because I just felt like they didn't want me mmm, but when they said hey why so I can't that's what's going on Friday, so I can't do it because I'm going to pause it. That's a triple win with. Yeah. You look Clinton, you know, yeah. Yes, I was. I come back on that Tuesday Wednesday, I go in addition. He goes. I'm here. Like I don't know what the reputation is. I mean this business like you could just ask me take the earrings out. Yes. I do. Like, you know, I can take earrings out. Oh, but oh is he worse? I was ready to quit. I was going to audition for this. I was tired. I was tired of this stupid stuff. I was tired. I was saying man why my audition for this junk? I'm funny. So Matt, why am I auditioning? Yeah, why am I what is going on? So I went out and got a melman's outfit. But all they had was a short set right said the pith helmet and at this short set. I'm getting me going all this and everybody else. They're sending but the same Melman outfit.	
2	Oh you thought you were thinking outside the box.	
1	I said, I told my brother. This is stupid. I've never done this anywhere. Just a four-part. Try to make somebody see me as though I hope things he's seen bad as his part as you know, what I don't care. I said quit I said, I'm done. He's so I said look at me man. I'm done. I'm done. So, you know I go I go and read I get in there and I was sitting there and And I got this Elmo says it's going to be cold in Minnesota. It's like a short set on Superman. It's the only sent the heck. Yeah, and I got the script in my hand and asked me about Bosnia and what everything was because they weren't living on this world. He's going to go by and say I said, well then don't audition me. Yeah, I'm not going to call these guys up until the troops. I can't come because I got a movie audition. Okay. I'm in the room. I'm kind of agitated. So Myron my character it kind of fit him. I was there in that mode. I get right there. Well, no, do you show me would you ever problem people tell me what to do. I said now I see who you've been talking to right Jesus. So I went to read the script. I still say this was God it fell out of my hand and the papers went everywhere. I lost it. I jumped up on the table and started going off on Arnold. He freaked and I went off I'm doing the lines and I'm freaking it was all in the audition. It's all an audition. Oh, wow, so I'm just becoming Myron, but I'm jumping at Arnold. Yeah, you look at my wild man with strippers everywhere. And after there's a thank you and I walked out. I took my brother out. I'm out. I take the stupid. Hello. I'm done. We're walking. Yeah across I think it's pretty much a lot. Whatever was I said, I'm gone man. Yeah the one of those what was it one of those that I can remember? I'm gone. I quit as man phone rings. Amen, he loves you coming back. It's okay me oh my Hollywood, right R2 is that's why the strangest wow, this is I've had they said love you. Don't leave come back to Saint Mary's home.	
2	Yeah, sounds great. So in that moment you said like you were done like trying to be an actor you were too young to understand up using one thing.	
1	I'm not auditioning anything else. I don't care. Yeah as I go do something else.	
2	That's crazy.	
1	So Arnold Arnold Schwarzenegger kind of fought for you to be and I was like, oh no, I think it was little okay his Asia, but they are not like me. Golly, but he's crazy about like so before this.	
2	Did you have any relationship with with Arnold Schwarzenegger?	
1	Oh, yes. I did. I met him. Was it after I did this city kids. I'm New York. Hmm. Arnold was honor was the in charge of that and it might have been City kids or mounted on it afterwards because I did some things from afterwards, but it was City kids. He brought the Humvee up. That's when God. I met first some of the actors who are happening now my girl from Dublin the blue dress. Choose one of the city kids at that time. Demi Moore was coming talking to the kids. It was great. They might differ on a show and a performance. They it was officially live TV. That's crazy. Yeah, that's awesome.	
2	And so in that year, I'm trying to think when the house gets come out house kisses us.	
1	We see fron of those 95, right?	
2	Okay. So yeah, that was before jingle all the way you already did houseguest you done Coneheads all that stuff. So at that point You're saying like as far as not wanting to audition you felt like at that point your career you yeah anymore.	
1	I was I was done I said, why is it I got keep fighting. Why isn't my calling from before but why am I always fighting for stuff right now? I'm always fighting force of always. I have my own movies already done. I had done houseguest. I had done first kid, you know, right and there was first go there. I'm like man, what is it about? You know, I thought but that I thought my resume would be this is the crazy, but I thought my resume would be 10 20 30 40 movies right know what made me know me started. At least kind of co-host. I've been co-star something if it it still bothers me because I can't get those years back when I was young. Right and I just never understood it but I'll I will take the hit so I tell people right continue to write because I always had an item and ideas all the time. We have ADHD you stop you pitched up there goes original. Yeah, but I never wrote on paper. I write two lines. Yeah, you know, then I went I had a bad experience as well. Let me write with some writers who can help me write it. But this reminds me of idea I had to go here you go right here. He writes his idea. He even lost a good script that want to do with Jada Pinkett Smith when she was young. Oh really where she was a foster kid, and I was a thief that took her in uh-huh. They show you. How long ago was yeah now her kids are the age right now, that's crazy.	
2	So now you casted all that stuff. So how would you say your actual experience like on set was was it?	
1	Okay pretty much get there. It's something I can't bring my own makeup people. So Sheila Evers is my makeup person. I'm like, sometimes you get the wrong white makeup person. It's not their fault. It not trained on the black face and maybe too dark whatever so I can bring my makeup person. Hmm. It's We're not gonna pay for us. I'll pay for it. So just find what I did. They made her audition. They put a key light on me. So I was your lifetime. She's like this somebody you know, how for your for your for your makeup person? Yeah. It may additionally it's another dude.	
2	Wow, that's crazy. Did they have their own like in house till you don't like telling their people team?	
1	Yo man. It's something that time to you. Never know how people are yeah, but other people bring their own makeup people right right happens all the time. I even learned how to do it's crazy. I said do my own makeup makeup artist taught me how to do my own makeup. I used to bring my own colors my own pancake. Yeah my own they anti-shine was my friend anti-shine. There was hard to find it wasn't even the United States and these blue eye drops was that I think my brother my eyeballs out because if if they approve right it's a knockout to rid us of the bread. They showed me how to run my eyes were dark from being up all night just to make it work that too because somebody your eyes go dark. So Tina was my girl. So she has to audition. So I got we said this is a crazy so we get there and not only has his Camp even guys who had surgery to look like, right? So he's got all these stuffed cats man. I'm like, whoa, and it's a it's a And the the stock coordinator was guy named Joe and I have Rusty remember my God. Yeah Roosevelt and I'll talk about rusty. Rusty was let go from the show from Jingle All The Way, yes. Oh, he was like, oh, yeah, you know, I know yeah he toward toward the end Deliver us to go because Rusty was fight for me not to get hurt and stuff and you realize and they Joe had an issue with Joel now Joe went back and apologized to everybody here heap if any we went to everyone and apologize. But he far Rusty High just football player. I'm going to sing when I fall with the doll. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. He's not the most he's not there. Mr. McClendon who passed away only stunt I've ever had just looks more like me. My my sister will welcome to start talking. Well the football player when he fell with the Dow that was his first stunt that fall he almost got jacked dang. He almost got jacked. Wow.	
2	Yeah, that's funny funny Side Story to that because I definitely remember that day because I remember I was on set and I was watching you do that because did you do it take where you actually fell on?	
1	Yeah, so far now as far up as that, right?	
2	Yeah. Yeah, and I remember that day because this has to do with one of the reasons why I used to pretend being all away never existed. That was the day where I thought I was going to be in the movie because remember you're like, oh, yeah. Yeah, we got it set up. So you're going to be the kid that drives the the RC car that you slip on. So I remember I was there they gave me a controller.	
1	They ran the scene where she's in the store like you're so cool scene is where Rusty slips and falls. Al's yeah, you know, you know that's different that's that's different the phone with the doll. Is that the in a movie where you fall off the tower, no not not here. No, you're the one in the store. Yeah, there's things I did. I did do three false they put because he had to hit with no mattress, right exactly because you can pop your head. Yeah, I hit three times with the mattress, right? So you see me on the initial fall of the rusty takes the bottom hit but you had an intricate moment. It's a pretty good moment for kid. It's really controlling a radio-controlled car and you're the reason Apple to fall.	
2	Exactly. So you guys are running. I'm supposed to be the one with this is why I do it I got were so excited - so excited. I was there. I was set up the whole scene runs and then yeah, so the whole thing happens. Yeah. I'm excited now. I think I'm in the movie and then we go to the premiere up in San Francisco and San Francisco and San Francisco that put cause I'm like what I'm like maybe for yeah five maybe five six five or six something like that. So I don't even care about the movie. I'm just happy that I wasn't thinking I think you told your friend like I probably told everybody and so they were Watching watching it that scene comes up and obviously it's not my mouth was open and there was a little white kid another producer Sunday substituted Royce.	
1	So I might add to this down if they don't remember the kids because they played with me. I don't know they were lying to me from day one. Just let you do it but you were the kid there because it had to be shocked when we were done. We walk down they had to have Rashad.	
2	I think they did I and in retrospect obviously being that young I didn't understand everything that was happening. But I saw you I did drop the same a nice. Have known because there was never coverage on me a camera was never pointed at me. No not well not now that I remember. I don't think there was yes.	
1	It was there was a bit the whole do that and that's dirt hair the camera had guys watching Michael you did it three times. I didn't get it because they get they got it up on your face it multiple ways in which mean they shot that and some producer must have said I want my son that you promised that to my son and they must've just cut you off. They could have called me saying man. Let your son know we Oh this guy hit let us and they looked because when you went down, they looked at me, I still love me don't love me don't show to remember saying don't show two actors get called time, but don't you show cause I saw you while they cry cement don't you give it to him.	
2	Literally my head dropped in the world just went black and I was I said, I've never felt more sad in my life.	
1	I said sinless man, you know, that was dirty. I suppose you know what you're showing me what I'll never do. Hmm. Yes.	
2	I've never be like you guys so that could have been my first acting role but instead it was the first time.	
1	Got cut from yeah, when people exist I think about you will see yourself every Christmas. What's exactly.	
2	Do you know you every Christian has no I would have been to get residuals.	
1	Don't tell me that's why they gives you know, what see you again?	
2	There's no slack in that - A specialized extra.	
1	Yeah. I know.	
2	Let's just move on before I cancel this whole.	
1	Yeah. All right, so I would say last name I give you a lot of things that were strange about that that that scene aside, but I mean so, you know have the issues with getting your own makeup artist.	
2	All that stuff. Was there anything else? Oh cars like on so do you remember how many shoot days there?	
1	Were we shot? I think maybe almost 10 15 day. Okay, I'm gonna take this and say what happened first. Yeah, we shot in Minnesota first, but you know, you got me in the snow. They had a freak early spring when things start turning green. Hmm. So we have snow on the ground the first cookie became a freak early spring. It was like what this is a tundra. This is Minnesota or didn't have the nerve to have an early spring only when you see movies, right? We see movies man. So we have to hurt film everything and the parade you sell the good stuff in the snow. You know II Universal hundred fifty degrees. Yeah. I remember that. I remember the water my head starts boiling. Yeah, the dementia helmet times like this. I think your heads going to blow up in a box full of boiling to go. Hey. Hey, so there's a cool head off. Yeah, but going back. Let's go back. Fuck it back first down to set my sister. Dorothy has said can I just come on watch this the first you know, that's the first first we have done. I wasn't a producer on or party have the right. It was the first time I was an actor anyway, no, I'm a creative and it was the first time I was just an actor. Hmm. It was weird because I said I don't know these people the producers and Nova. Yeah. I knew Arnold's agent. That's it. That's it. Wow. So first day everybody's watching somebody's oh no, we keep the earrings Is it because I said y'all to keep them because he's a militant kind of a mailman. Yeah, and that's all you can put Postman American flags in I said, it's all kind of ways we can do this. Right? Right. The first is said I'm sitting because I know that when we take them out as a guys I can hear I said it's the most punk way to talk to a man Arnold just looked at some inside me goes.	
2	No, I like it.	
1	So first day of shooting and we shoot the scene is funny that you're cut. Let me just take this to another level goes what as for another take. He asked for another take. I do my sin bad thing. He's laughing so hard they could usually go with it. Wait. Wait, I get one right? So we competing we became friends trying to one-up each other that's crazy. It was off and running and now the crews are relaxed, right? All right. Now that come into my trailer his stunt guys are kind of my trailer. I'm having a conversation with people. Yeah, if I was in my trailer by myself to enter with him, this is so strange right and I'll trim it by yourself. It became cool. Nice. So you're not a long time saying no God that just got along me. These are amazing clown made always messing with you. Yeah, little man, you weak man little man, just right week here in a trailer that he worked out in and I said of strudel Have a Cigar he had a I said, I remember this is brutal, but it's just going big I want donut man when I'm making right donut stick back in right? So it's It's funny. His makeup person wasn't there one time and he goes have Sheila he kind of seamless seamless system body says Sheila do my face. She looked him up and his makeup guy got there. We got a little late. I think I have Sheila do it. Oh, did he give her Play Store Namaste just messing with you? Okay. Got it. I seen it was after that shit was it was God. They treated like they cheered a totally different. Yeah. That's what I said. Say I told you know to my dog sometimes Ernie get there. Yeah, I don't you got to feel nothing about me, but when it's once I'm there. I'm making my moment, right and that's as an actor Entertainer. How do you make a moment about stealing from the main guy trying to upstage? How do you like I'm gonna give you the best I have but I know it's your movie right? I'll give them the next one. They'll see this this one. So maybe there's some dude there's an older woman extra stand at that time. Well, I'm in my late 30s 40s. So there's an older woman who's my age now, but be my age but I am now so she's a stand next to me all the reasons. Pinch the booty is that Sinbad stop that and if I'm sorry, it's okay. I said I sleep. All right, sleep the games are on hand. Wow. Yeah, so I've put him in another bad position the scene where were running to the post office and boom boxes at him. Yeah. I was trying to tag. Oh, yeah. I was trying to tag him the fight scene in the diner. Maybe start going down and they go. Whoa, I'll start guys man. That's not a fake phone. You already caught me with the phone was at do you place the phone with a rubber foam better put a back brace on? Because I stopped him opposed to fight right right. There was he goes we do this ourselves. We're in we're too big dude. Yeah, and this phone booth. That's crazy. I think that's why I work man it just but he was so cool. I don't have air conditioning suit cigar and that that little suit with that the hoses the air conditioner just pumping air through he sit there man. He liked me. You look hot and boy, I'm boiling he must do they just some for he pretty much had like	
2	he had everything as far as like being taken care of like a murderer off. He's the man.	
1	Yeah, he's dead. It's something that you shoot for and angry. I learned a lot from him even testing with audiences. We were testing and even my my doll. Yeah the Dementors.	
2	Oh that's mentioned in the next part.	
1	There's a mentor I had a prototype. Yeah and the men turned out tested High. Mmm. I said, he's a genius businessman. He was little we get you hit your better down.	
2	Yeah the down never came never came up because that's all. The the biggest question, how come there was never a dementor Adama there so we can all blame Arnold Schwarzenegger have that I blamed on had a moment Mandy see just a moment.	
1	You're doing to Nate you're doing terminate at 96.	
2	I just want a moment bro, right? And because that's because the Turbo Man doll is actually sold for a little bit. You know, you're gonna die I think will be really smart. It's to re-release Turbo Man doll. And the defense offered all those mother. Those are the mentor and limited Lydia make that you can make the top boil. Right? Is it make the water boil? There we go.	
1	Oh, he's got here to the scene where I had the boy goes he took to yeah, you know, I had to bed. Look. I had a jacked up here that time, you know, the stomach jumps on me, bro me down. Yeah, he told him get him. Wow. So now I want to take a run and he grabbed my leg. That's it. I'm gonna outrun the stump me.	
2	Right right.	
1	Do I started writing a big old Clydesdale boots sort of who say I don't ya. Do grammarly clip me? I'm running doing is gonna mean you can see I'm laughing so hard I said if I do not fall to the ground, they started climbing on my back. I'm laughing said he'll go kill me right? I'm on the back of the hollow top of me and the little ball foul.	
2	Right? Right. I love that lip. So it seems like both of y'all just were clown in the whole time dude.	
1	It's probably one of the most because it wasn't my movie and I had no responsibility. Right right. You don't have to say I think even if you produce a look at When I see Spencer black filmmakers and also serious, you know, what the film? Yeah, you know we can have some fun mmm, but we're also seriously to be here and work with these people and it could have some responsibility. Yeah and to be in a movie we like hey man, just have fun, especially when you've done to other way just to hey, I have no responsibilities of the to be an actor and I had I had not had that since the beginning of my career right?	
2	And obviously you being just the the An improv.	
1	Oh, I'm sure you improved a lot do it was like every what the eyes of a hawk the ears of a snake right kept all that craziness. Yeah. Well Robert Conrad did this is a man with this improv and right.	
2	So what would probably be your favorite line that you improv that made into the final film?	
1	The eyes of years that would be that well that one it's a sick world with the bomb. Uh-huh. No, I'm working two puff is everybody. Let me go crazy and then we went outside went bloop. They said he had a line. Oh, yeah, that's when people started with do terrorism. Uh-huh. When it blew up. Yeah, we blew up. One of The Producers said look man. We can't just leave that I said, it's a sick sick world. I love that. I say something right sick sick world. That's awesome.	
2	So I think because	
1	A lot of impromptu. Oh, yeah, man, because I took do here at Orson do we would toss and stuff back and forth. I'm take you can't catch me. It was just do it was so funny man. That's Phil Hartman him when he was hitting on his wife. It was dirty was so smiley.	
2	Yeah, he here body that has yeah, we had a right and that's actually great too because that's the segue because I was going to ask like, how was that because obviously worked on Phil worked with Phil Hartman on Jingle All The Way along with out. Houseguest and Coneheads, right? That's right corner.	
1	Yeah, so you had multiple movies work with the but this one I get a chance to be in scenes with that's right. That's true. I didn't get any sanctions. I just got a chance to watch him work right remember but member on the set of the same time. That's when my man one of his first movies. Come on. Why might you burn Verne Troyer? The remember man Verne Troyer? Yep party burn ya know party Varnado. He liked to Party Party Barn.	
2	Would it be like a group thing or?	
1	Yeah. He looks. Man we go out. He's the man. He's the he is the cat pic. Right? I think it was an operator when I got into the movie babies that they needed a small person play baby burn played the baby and babies day out. Hmm. They said he was an operator or something. Hey man, welcome act never won back the hope and became a Hollywood dude. Remember enjoy. It was out. He would just do the movies. Vernon was a personality bro. That's awesome. Yeah, that's so awesome.	
2	So speaking of going out to though. I remember you saying you had some experiences with Arnold as Far as him trying to pressure you into smoke some cigars. Okay.	
1	This is how it started Arnold through a free shoot party. Mmm. I'm used to power out to my party time. I said we are no parties. Yeah. Well, the pre-shoot party was just above the line people. So no crew. Was there anything I was like this at a pool hall. I said, what's the party said? This is all this coming. I said that ain't right. I had never done apart like that. Every time I've done a project halfway through I know it's time to throw a party. Otherwise people lose their minds so halfway through, you know, jingle all the way it was Princess Club Grand Grand Avenue. We throw a 70s party. Oh really and he was dressed 70s. You don't remember doing honey. Remember they'll Bail Bonds Pace at the wig on. Oh wait.	
2	Yeah you and I didn't know that was a supreme Master Bruce. Okay, dude, that's	
1	We throw the send me the crew was like clicking on my pocket. Yeah, who's like me ever? Yeah, man. You're the man Arnold.	
2	I will pay you back.	
1	So he threw a party at the toward the end cigar part. Great. Yeah great place man. I never smoked cigars. He gave me the bank man. These were the Cubans the real about that big. Yeah, man, Sinbad China trying to learn my almost with the three of them. I went to go pee room stopped spinning. I was hanging onto the banister by Edison be home by water and it is send me back to the hotel and I was first time you ever smoked cigarette. I say oh that's a first-class. This will be my thing rather than start going out to Mark the Dorothea. I'm gonna go see go ahead Dorothy smoke with me start going to cigar bars with always ask our bar next. Yeah, man cigars my thing. Yeah, because it ain't smoking I won't post and I didn't know that man's man and somebody said There's always a who's SMS smoking cigars that me I'm a bang. Try another one.	
2	It's a setting you up man.	
1	I want to go pee so steps. I swear I hung onto the railing. Uh-huh. I says, how was somebody's hike that they put me in the car. He goes by they put me in a car somebody back talked out that mr. Slovak and that was it. That was that.	
2	Yeah, that's hilarious see and all that stuff of the II assumed I wasn't at that party.	
1	No good at that part. I'm a bit something today. I probably shouldn't admit because it was a good it was a good scam but it does work because I don't didn't know it. Hmm. I don't have a water bottle drinking. I would preach drink it. I pop the top and drink it. What is he like your opener? I would drink it going back everybody serious his people looking at it payback. Wow, he drink it. Don't drink some more if Arnold ever watches. Is this man? I got one up on you man. You don't know buddy. Wow, I got you man.	
2	Got you Arnold. So that was that payback for the cigars.	
1	Yes. That's hilarious. I forgot I felt good about myself and if somebody is because something who said it's almost worse. It knows my water and honors water. That's too funny man.	
2	What would you say was your favorite scene to shoot?	
1	First one because that's when the first scene because me and him. Bonding never could have been totally different we did see was over and tell you boys. I have been in the business since 85. It's like 98. It's the first time I've been waiting to work with a star. Yeah. Yeah star star and this this was like my moment but I had never been like here's a star beside his me didn't want me on the movie. But I know what I can bring to a movie. Yeah, so I'm going how do I let him know and I tried my Just prayed that like guys be atheists don't believe Of I do and I pray this at God. Show me when I make my move and right when we both fell in the snow I said hey, that was a good take yeah, we'll make it better. Make it funny girls. Yes, it's did he ask for another tape? That's funny.	
2	So for people who might not know yes break down what that for that scene you're talking about is like what were you guys doing this?	
1	Right? We're at the mailbox. When go around the corner right before the motorcycle fell over. Yeah. Yeah. So is that see me him a walk it nice and he's knocking me out which are knock each other two mailboxes beat each. Right, right, but one of my favorite scenes will sit down him top of the Johnny a rocket. We had a moment where we kind of bonded in the diner. Yeah and see what happened when he's the father. He said man, you kicking me messed up because I never got that Johnny a rocket. It was a real moment then also we heard it was a toy somewhere else, right Ryan was right back to enemies and there was a it was an ending that would have been cool to they probably should shut both of them. You seem you saw me disappear and my cloud of smoke, right right Mentor. Yeah, I was supposed to You want to see the police bring me to his house for Christmas dinner download me I'm locked up, but they let me come in again with them. Oh nice, so I'll be sitting with his family. That's crazy. And I tried to steal the down while you're there.	
2	I love it. I love it. Yeah, that would be a nice setup for SQL.	
1	Yeah when they've been well they did do that. They did we how you doing.	
2	Sick what I anybody actually I'm curious like what he did how he has to it.	
1	How did houseguest who did houseguests? The house against engine while the way are you serious? Yes. Wow, the Cable Guy Yeah Yeah. Well, yeah Larry the Cable Guy.	
2	Yeah, so because would you go all the way the sequel I came out in 2014. I'm wondering what the studio was think they went straight to straight to the yeah. I wonder why that even try it like what maybe like schedules didn't work out. So they're like, let's just do this or do they just want to go?	
1	No, they never I just think hey we can do it. We can make a franchise. It doesn't matter. I think you're trying to say we can do a franchise. With any two people. I think I'm trying to do it, you know some chose. Well, it's got two different to new people.	
2	And yeah, but no because like they had already kind of technically set up for a sequel when Arnold forgets the present for his wife and looks over. Yeah. So like they're already could have been a setup there.	
1	I didn't have to be in it, but there could have been another guy sees honor could just another good done two or three of these.	
2	Yeah, and also maybe kind of had a something to do with which I didn't realize till I got older was that the movie actually didn't like do well with critics.	
1	I've been doing critics. They didn't want to be honest such a success successful person. Yeah, and of course, you know the infilling me mmm. Yeah, it wasn't feeling it all. Yeah, but the people fell in love it.	
2	Yeah, and that's what's crazy like literally. Yeah every like every like, you can't go through the holidays without somebody mentioning.	
1	Yeah jingle all the way and they played all year, but they played a lot, you know, exactly played during the year and then they played a lot now.	
2	Yeah, so that I think jingle it's a perfect example of how a move We can come out during a specific time get crushed in ready comes with and becomes a family movie.	
1	Yeah, we did know it became a cult film. We love we thought was we thought we had a blockbuster man.	
2	Yeah, and now that is a blog post it it has become one of the best Christmas become one, maybe not during that time, but it definitely became it is as the time went on which is great and I always thought that the dopest thing ever wood is if they actually did It in actual Turtleman series do like if they rebooted that that envelope little something it's like Flash Gordon.	
1	Yeah.	
2	Yeah, it feels it's actual show that they did as live-action/animated all that stuff. But like did it legit. I always thought that would be awesome.	
1	But you know trouble that was kind of cool even miss it was an evil Evil Genius. Yeah him still exist. Nobody like nobody like and see and that's something that would be great in the TV show because that's Then you could build on food. You know Jim Sturgess. He's the one always trying to sabotage.	
2	Yes, you know, he starts off as The Whistleblower exactly see and that's that's what I'm saying. There's so much missed Opera like potential in moments like that in those old school moves Hollywood doesn't build on Hollywood.	
1	You would think I think that used to be more creative minds not saying there's not creative minds out here, but guys who ran Studios and stuff now it's like this ever so scared to try anything. Yeah, it's almost like when something hits like Netflix and Hulu those those networks, whatever not networks with companies pushed everybody. Yeah, they pushed everybody out of their comfort zone.	
2	Yeah.	
1	That's crazy.	
2	Yeah, just out of curiosity. Did you ever get a chance to see Phil Hartman before you passed after?	
1	Yeah, that's my mom. Oh, yeah, we talked we talked man we would talk because he was into a planes whose in the boats. I was gonna blame. Oh, okay. He was a boat guy man. He was even man. That's I'll mail like planes. They go what and bought a plane flying you did it. Yeah, it's cool. He was with my kids. Just bring him. Yeah bring them.	
2	Roger yeah, I always brought you guys everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, like I remember just being like staying in the trailer. Yep. It's hanging out waiting for you to finish or sometimes. They let us, you know, stick out or other times. They would pretend that I was going to be in a scene that I wasn't in the scene later even a cowboy movie.	
1	Yeah Cherokee Kid. Oh God Royce you had a history that one broke my heart when I got it cut out of know when I sat in fought my mom. My brother had a second. Let me get like I said, I thought I said I cannot cut him out of the see me fail. He got hurt running know.	
2	It seems you're running I said Iran spell ran so fast, and I will those cowboy boots and I because I had to run into a building and soon as I ran into that building in my head. I was like, they're gonna cut this scene I messed up I messed up so I wasn't supposed to fall.	
1	No, but you did get it right. They just see what y'all the schoolhouse but paint all the kids in San Fran got cut, but you know what? On the original for this.	
2	I know I know which is good which is good. My whole thing is just you know, it would have been nice to make one. I know man and I think subconsciously nothing about I think that's what made me want to have worked behind camera.	
1	We have with me victory said what Sinbad show when I ran things this is true. I am in episode of Sinbad show know what not just one that was so again couple of years.	
2	Yeah the party with Ray J the cake party you're in the family reunions 1 u 1 and the random one where you're getting your hair cut and I'm like walking in good.	
1	Anchor paid. Yeah, she's in the to yeah, my daughters getting stuff cut. Yeah.	
2	Yeah those I can always hold onto those. Yes. Those are always great.	
1	Yeah, but otherwise you're closer once because he's old you remember? Yeah that seemed to feel that was great.	
2	See that's what I could do because before I was regretting even doing this whole Jingle All The Way thing because it brought so many bad memories, but you know, there's no this was good though. Yeah, I mean is is there anything else that you know, you think would be cool for people to know that maybe you've not ever talked about when it comes to this movie? Um something where they can while they're watching it during the holidays were like, oh man.	
1	Now this makes more sense or oh what that really means and I see oh, we I just said to pray this was going to blow your mind the whole time. We didn't pray it was a it was one of hottest days. We had left Minnesota. It was about 110. Yeah, but it's you understand everybody all the extras people are out there dying. Yeah, that's why Garrett Morris that was doing things like oh such a chilly day out here. He was just exaggerating. Oh God, man.	
2	Oh would that with those that parade seems that probably the worst. No, I think it was so fun. Dude. It was still fun.	
1	What's good, you know, but I think I have more fun in Minnesota because it was cold. Yeah women coats and million men in Minnesota and people get you real neighborhoods doing stuff. Uh-huh. Yeah that Was fun cement I'm trying to think it just weird because that was a movie. I felt Vindicated because I came to a place that the director didn't want me to buy one of me.	
2	Yeah, and I did my thing as far as like all the projects you've done. Where would you rank?	
1	Jingle all the way this one of the top ones one of the top ones my favorite? I still think my favorite is checky.	
2	Checky can't ya see kid.	
1	That was definitely fun. Yeah.	
2	Nice jingle all the way to three top fives cos house.	
1	Kiss has to come after. Yeah sure. He kidding. Okay, and then you got General away the first kid nice. Yeah, cool. This was good.	
2	I think they actually might be cool to like dive into more of like your projects because I feel like a lot of people don't get to really hear your side when it comes to a lot of this stuff.	
1	We yeah, it's just like, okay, what would you say it like the Sinbad show that would go. Yeah Fox and fox was not doing programming, you know 24 hours yet. It was it was a Disney. I had it did. Deal, you know and Joe Roth was that man, Joe Roth has he still doing some of your office in and Rodger Berman. Wow. What a bitch. He's a look Disney's I want you to do a TV series don't he said?
