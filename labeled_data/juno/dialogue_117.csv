Hi guys, it's Mark. I'm here trying to spin right around in my chair and your lies in the house everybody you thirsty as well.	
3	I got guys I Supply the champagne today.	
1	Yeah. Yesterday I surprised the plastic cup and I'm drinking because why they're not clinking the Titanic will go down faster the drunker and I did have a drink and a shot before we started. All right. So the rules since since that is the case, I will only speak when spoken to you guys.	
3	It's a drag race AfterBuzz TV drinking game. Mark disobeys his own rules take a drink. Yeah, what did you guys think of the episode? I thought this was a really creative challenge. I was excited by it a fresh new challenge. I love Design Channel channels. I love design challenges. They remind me so much of like like Project Runway and I just love seeing everyone kind of work as a cohesive unit. Well, some people work on the cohesive unit and I just thought it was really fun. It was very light-hearted. So everything's positive. Just wanted somebody to hand me that paper.	
1	I was reaching for my champagne. I was like, I'm sorry, I enjoyed the episode because like we've never seen this challenge before so it's pretty new. I loved like I guess it was a comedy challenge to get some way. So it was Personality. Yeah.	
3	It was all it was a lot of things rolled into one you had to have a lot of different you had of Hosting skills. You had a design skills comedy was in there as well. So before we move on to our next topic though, I just wanted to say thank you for making AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of TV talk for us to grow. We need your help.

Shout out to one fan at the end of the episode every week. So if you do that if you like us and make a comment. I meant you could get a shout-out. But moving on any other thoughts mark on the episode.	
1	Oh, I'd be happy to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed the episode. I thought everybody was wonderful and nobody should have gone home. Are you feeling okay? Oh, yeah, this is not okay. I don't accept this Marie. Where are you Lorraine? I actually really did enjoy the episode. I actually thought it was a great Challenge and I will admit when they do great things. I thought it was a great. Challenge because it is something that drag queens have to do maybe not from start to finish creating the whole event, but I have a lot. Yeah, I have a lot to say later, but that's all I'll say right now and everyone who's joining us in the chat room.	
3	I see Chapel Theo Hutton Bryce Mitchell KenKen 29. Thank you guys for tuning in every week, especially this week when rent live is happening and you're watching us instead. Oh thank goodness. Good thoughts. Oh, that's a cool name. And challenging and Jesus together tomji. That's you could be watching valentina's sing live. But instead you're watching us.	
1	So we thank you. So we thank you for I said I assumed Mark was always drunk on set Bryce that is not a kind thing to say my mother wanted some time. It's just every other episode every other every up. The one I wasn't here wasn't drunk. That's why you weren't here.	
3	So the main challenge we had Latrice come back and then Latrice got two pair everyone off. So she picked her team it was Trinity and Manila and then she put mode and Monique together and Valentina and Naomi together. It didn't seem like I got the only one that seemed kind of sabotage. She was putting Valentina and Naomi together since it was kind of like a consensus that they were the bottom. Not last week, but the week before yeah state but Latrice was smart to get with the frontrunners.	
1	Yes. She was kind of herself with anyone else because she's like she knows the RuPaul curse the combat Queen pierce the yes, come back.	
3	You mentioned right out the door.	
1	Yeah, so she broke that which she did good. Yeah.	
3	I felt bad for Naomi though having to work for with Valentina. I'm surprised the trees didn't put Monique with Valentina because they kind of have like a rivalry going on. Yeah and you know Monique and Monet they have like This friendship and they're always working together. I don't know like I'm kind of like I wish they wouldn't work as together as much personally because it's kind of like that's what I think that this challenge is right up their alley. Yes. Yes. So them that they needed Mark you can speak.	
1	No, it's going to raise my hand from down. No, I was thinking do you think and maybe they'll say at the beginning of next week's episode. Do you think Latrice was being strategic in like trying to create issues or she thought she Was generally putting the best people together best people together.	
3	Yeah, nasty like that.	
1	Yeah, I don't think so either because if she was she would have done that. Yeah.	
3	She was really I think she would have mentioned it to ya ugly and the confessional. Okay. Go back to my Champion. So Valentina Naomi did Club 96 which was supposed to be like Studio 54 wait. We also need together real quick little ASMR 96	
1	Hands down. The best part of their thing was Naomi doing. Yeah and Charlie felt like a Saturday night Live's. Yeah when he said that I was like, oh my God, that's exactly what it was. Yeah, the funny part of it to me was the show they had to do with the name that garlic and they messed up. That was fun. Yes.	
3	Yeah, that was terrible. It's just I mean, it's interesting because you saw Valentina read the other teens were having like a You looking club and she was so concerned about the club looking nice that she didn't think about the concept of who did you say was this you who were you referring to Valentina Valentina? Okay. Yeah. She's shading the other teams for not having it look nice. Right, but but there's the concept ended up being not as strong as the other one trunks doesn't look nice, but they do well. I'm usually drunk when I go in there so and then Naomi ended up fronting most of the work because like Valentina wasn't helping like write the scripts and she was kind of like joking on joking around while they were trying to like paint the set which is funny to watch but then you're thinking like if I was Naomi I would be I would probably be more like tents and visibly nervous. Because I would be like no dude. We need to get this props to her for like kind of caring that team. I feel like Valentina and I went back into her old because she'd kind of the same thing last her season when she wasn't like studying the words like she kind of just coasted through it and that what's in her home. So I felt like Valentine just like missed the mark on this missed the mark this episode. So I think so too. I just felt bad for her.	
1	It's our confessional. It was a lot of I and the Fantasy III and never once did she say we know and I was just like you didn't do you didn't do nothing but paint a wall really, you know, yeah, but the outfit was cute the painting outfit.	
3	I wear that to church to save painting out but I liked I liked manila's painting outfit. I would like a hot like backstreet boy.	
1	Yeah. I put I had to put this down Latrice getting into the jumper. Yeah deserves also watch that. It was the best part of the show it to me that was funny hilarious.	
3	I like the O in the chat. He said production must have helped them with the sets. Yeah, just probably true.	
1	Okay. So if you go to when Monique a Monet were doing there, there's sketching out. They had like markers on a board and then they show manila's all like profession right today. She's a graphic design.	
3	Right? So Monet Monique's there's was the black hole, which was like a mystery alien sci-fi. Why thing going on first off? I love that idea because anybody is going to want to go to a club called the black hole just for the injection marks a lot. So every Tuesday and Thursday to me their whole concept if you look at just the concept would be the most intriguing because I have the I would want to be What's going on there? They have some sort of like alien baby display.	
1	Like I think there's was the most creative. I like I said, this is right up their alley. They were able to shine.	
3	Nobody actually like talk over each other like Jersey Justice which was surprising props ammonia because I feel like Monique does that she kind of talks over her like partner a lot of the time but they Vibe well together. They have a lot of chemistry there probably goods are great to meet ya, you know, they were black and yellow also were they	
1	I don't need your money Kappa black and yellow black and yellow I notice I when I watch the second time, I went oh, hold up. Yeah. I thought there must have been a yellow and black challenge. Yeah my money they got cut or something.	
3	I also think that their outfits look better than the runways. I know we'll talk about Runway. Yeah, but also I think they're the strongest MCS out of the bunch. So they did really well. I thought they were underrated. I was confused when Michelle said something along the lines of what did she say? Like, was it outer space or was it a lie the same I'm like, what are you talking about, Michelle?	
1	Same thing.	
3	Yeah the kind of go hand in hand.	
1	I actually Michelle's not I'm finding myself saying this more this season. I don't know why but I actually kind of agree with her because I felt like it was a very it was kind of like let's create a theme that can be anything. So we don't have to be as specific we can kind of do this and we can kind of do that we can kind of do this. So, I think that was kind of her point and I did kind of agree with that because it was it was like there was an alien, baby. Baby that you could touch but then there were moons and stuff. And then there I don't know. It did seem a little it didn't seem as cohesive as the hive which I know we will get into and I have notes about it, but I liked it and I agree. I think they were hosting wise I thought they did a good job.	
3	I to me that was out of all of the clubs. That was the most appealing. So I would have picked them as the winner and we can talk about this later, but I do think That it was a little bit dick in the soup for them to not win over the Beehive team.	
1	Well because this is like Latrice is redemption was should be the name of the episode. Yeah, that's exactly what it was. Well that being said are we talking about the hive now?	
3	Yeah, so it turned into T. Manila Latrice. They had a beehive theme which on its face the concept of a club as a beehive. I was like, oh, I don't know how this is gonna work. But when when everything came together and you wash it and then that ending with the release the bees I thought I thought that was amazing after that.	
1	It's so funny. I see the mean there was a mean like that with Oprah and it's like release the bees and all the bees in the crowd was I don't know. It's funny. I thought that was funny. So yeah when I watched it the third time I took these notes because I just thought and this is my point and I think what I do this when I read this, it'll make my point of what I was talking about with Monique and Monet. There was like the honey like the set itself was just gorgeous the honey dripping off the shelves brilliant attention to detail the design. I said the design in general the sweetest. I probably the sweetest hot spot.	
3	That was one of the things they said like to promote the club.	
1	Oh, right, right like and again like referring to the honey and the behead sweetest hotspot clever. What's the buzz all about? I just Loved it sent sprawling luxurious space of twenty by sixteen feet, which I thought was hysterical anybody time any time sending. Somebody said honey, it fit the theme it's the bee's knees, which they said multiple times. It's all the buzz the be teeny the FIB biatch one of the most brilliant thing Beasley the Vib keeper, which why haven't we been using the I just thought it was just tripping spelling bee. I just I just I just kept going and it was just that attention to detail and it was so specific and not one thing didn't not match everything worked perfectly. And I think that that's why they won over the other two because the other ones I felt was just kind of so General.	
3	Yeah, black Unity, man. So I they had a they had a what was it? There was like a beam me up Scotty drink and I like that it would correlate. I think yeah, there was a beam me up drink the person serving. It was Scotty like it was like a space thing.	
1	I know but I just think that it was just I just think the it was just so specific and so like every single thing was so spot-on. I don't know it just it just it just seemed like it was so perfect.	
3	Like there wasn't a flaw I might have been having said that don't you think all three of them should have won instead of just two of them. That was the other problem. That's not how the show	
1	Goes Jackie they all three can't it's wrong, but I do think but I do think it was kind of a punishment for Manila for because she was speaking. I think we can all agree. She was speaking over them and she was kind of jumping over them and trying to outshine them which is a competition not a problem, but I think it was kind of their way of going we're going to teach you a lesson here and I didn't maybe even been just to kind of snap her back because I do think she's getting a little Well, she's becoming a front-runner now. She's right lane right like we got a week.	
3	Yeah, so that's just I feel like my eternity like I love Manila I want her to do well, but I feel like Trinity is kind of more of a front runner now at this point than the Anila because she's like been doing a lip syncs like almost every single week, right? So it's kind of like like I don't know Trinity will be the Katya the season. Well, she though yeah, I have a feeling like she has a good potential to win. I feel like and I don't know if I want that too. I feel like Manila my And just because having like a queen who's been on ya like involvement drag race so long and I was like as a brand thing. Yeah. Hmm. Well, so any last thoughts sorry.	
1	I lost the my computer died. So I'm changing over to my phone for the chat room in black holes defense.	
3	I just feel like the Beehive I thought they did great but I feel like they're like little little gimmicks overshadowed like they're emceeing a Lil Bit whereas I feel like black holes they did a great job of kind of incorporating their themes and their themes not overshadowing their emceeing I guess that's what I'm trying to say, but they did they both did great and so I'm glad either one of them would one so I'm happy with beehive wedding. So there I do think that the black hole was built on Monet and Monique's personalities and the be high was built more on the concept. So I totally I totally agree with you there.	
1	You're all winners. You're all winners. the trophy	
3	so any last thoughts on the main challenge before we move to the right absolutely do not. Okay. So Runway, what did you think of Roose outfit? I loved it. I really liked it. I love a good fuzzy arm.	
1	I liked her hair. I like the fuzzy arm Lack of Color. I like the color. I think I'm gonna give my kudos to Rupaul this season because I think I think this is the I think this might be my favorite outfit RuPaul season of costumes. Yes, it's I don't know. It's put it on your calendar. Designer who makes sure that pink and blue is so harsh and you never liked clashes with the color that room wearing but it's still a bad on the eyes. Yeah.	
3	It's so bright, but it's never like never class you so yes, so Runway the theme was Plastic Fantastic which was weird to me because I was like, why won't you have a be a club Kid theme is drive me crazy when the runway theme doesn't match the challenge right?	
1	Although some of them were kind.	
3	And of Club, yeah, some of them weren't likely chooses was very Club kitty. Yeah, so so we have the looks do yes.	
1	Oh, yeah incoming all we brought us the look. I did my work the Lord's my chest. Okay. So the trees is the first one amazing.	
3	She has like a very like plasticy Club kid outfit with balls coming out of her head and I understand the latex.	
1	I believe it's Venus Venus latex or something like that.	
3	But I agreed with Michelle when Michelle was like this is one of My favorite hands down done.	
1	Yeah handsome for her. Yes for her. Yeah, because I was like, it was like, please don't be a pageant gown, right? I now when she said she's got her all-time favorite. Fun fact Loris from Dracula actually helped make this costumes.	
3	So the next one is Manila. This was my favorite one.	
1	I like all of them out of all that Jackie B.	
3	I you know because I actually did love the spaghetti one last week. It wasn't my favorite because there were other ones that were my favorite but this one was my favorite.	
1	I think it's giving me plenty To Wong Foo realness kind of we went to my least favorite. I have to say the hey I just was too there was too much and I know she's usually so so like spot-on. I just there was this things on the shoes and then the dress and then the head He's and then the earrings and I just wish it was just the dress and a simple shoe. I don't know. It just it was too much.	
3	I like the silhouette. I love the silhouette. I like to drive cygnus of like this plastic dress like cinched at the waist with a ribbon. She gets up.	
1	What's a nice pecs I'll be down because my thing is Let's Not Be bias here because we let Alaska walk in a trash bag twice. Yeah, and we gagged over that.	
3	So I did not I just know you didn't I don't think I did. I still don't understand why you might agree on that.	
1	Okay. Well, I started something over here. I'm stepping away from the microphone to refill the champagne. I'll be back.	
3	Thank you. I mean Monet we can we can talk about money. Oh, that's Trinity. Yes, so Trinity had the bubble gum outfit. I like the color blue gum the colors nice. Fella. Oh, thank you.	
1	Stella Jane. Okay, probably gonna Ronis. I love it the the silhouette of it the design just all of it together. It's just amazing. I liked it. I did plastic. I like to like a my mood is it I liked her hair more than I like the outfit, but that's just me. I think I think she looks gorgeous. I'm not saying it looks I'm by no means giving it's a thumbs up just not like I'm not like floored by it. I love the hair. I want to know who does her wigs because every one of her wigs is so beautiful. I'm like, oh I want that way Sparkles. Hmm gotta follow them on Instagram. They're gorgeous. Her hair is absolutely Flawless and I that's item jealous. Not that my personal hair isn't amazing Ali.	
3	I have any thoughts on the bubble gum. I like the color. That's kind of it. It's not bad. I just don't have much to say yeah.	
1	What are you serious?	
3	I like the color I think in our markets where I'm like that's good.	
1	It's good. It's a challenge. I did.	
3	Well, yeah, I've seen better looks from Trinity. Yeah. Absolutely. It's a decent. Look, it's not my favorite. Yeah. Next is Naomi and this is my least favorite. Yeah, cause she already did this. I hate dating Royals already. She's worn this outfit like a thousand times where it's like some she wants these innate it was the Combs with her hair is like a re-creation of this don't like it.	
1	I didn't I didn't like At first I didn't like it.	
3	I don't think about that outfit because it was actually more this already. I just feel like she keeps doing the same silhouette. It's like these are my beautiful legs. We know you have beautiful legs now, give us a different silhouette.	
1	I want to see her in like a cat suit a bodysuit. We can't we can't get upset about silhouette because of	
3	Del Rio Bianca Del Rio was funny as fuck.	
1	So but wear the same dress the entire see our biases. Hell, I think when I look at it, I don't see plastic first and foremost.	
3	I see neon like kind of like the Nia of her seasoning morning her face looks beautiful though.	
1	I think she looks good. I again it's another one. I'm like, I like it. I don't love it. I think that the dress looks exactly like valentina's promo.	
3	Look this season. Do you remember her dress? That's exactly what Valentina Warfare promo. Look this All-Star season so far audio	
1	Listeners, she's wearing a neon coats meow.

3	It was the yellow it was hurting. My eyes was too much. Yeah Valentina she did. Kind of like a Miss Venezuela Barbie thing where she's got like a Miss Venezuela Sash and a crown on it was funny because Michelle read her thoughts a group, right?	
1	She was like dragged now when I first saw this that was like, oh she was and she was Columbia I can see why but through laughing the whole time. Yeah. Yeah, didn't you wear this before? She's like now and The crowd I've seen it.	
3	No, I was ready for Valentina. And that part I was like sorry Michelle.	
1	Yeah, so I was coming for you said this was your favorite.	
3	I really liked it. I it's like I haven't like valentina's looks this season.	
1	You don't remember me you like this more than what she wore last week. What was she wearing them? Speak the maroon with the red hair the jumpsuit that was boring, huh? That was that literally that literally looks like something Monet would wear what's your name on it has What did you say did you say you like this? This is perfect because it's like plastic Barbie.	
3	Hello. I didn't get it was definitely her brand. I love the hair. Like I kind of wish if she was I didn't have like I wasn't like yay or nay. I just wish that she was in real she was going for oh my God, you can tell she's a you could tell she was going for the Barbie thing and then I'm like well then dress like just like wherever you are be. All right, you know, I'm right. Yes, and why it was like yeah like a Miss Universe thing.	
1	But now a Barbie I was that not like she was more like a like the pink latex like iconic Barbie suit with the low glasses. I would have got it. Yeah, and then, you know, it designed it where you know with the arms would have this disconnect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can you help me when I'm packing for ya 12. I'll meet you in the back home. I just I did I thought the same thing and I knew right away. That she wasn't as Colombia. I remembered that but my thing was why would you do it again? It's still I don't I get that it's not the same country. I'm not saying that I don't understand the Venezuelan Colombia are different countries. I'm just saying it's the same thing. It really is the same thing. You're putting on a sash and being a contestant from a Miss Universe Pageant for another. Yeah for the second time you're competing in the same show. So I like come up with something new. I just thought it was like I did you like it was like, but I like that release to be	
3	Ali and I say have something nice to say about Valentina for once she's gone. She got eliminated. No, but like I like the metaphor of that like Miss Universe is very fake great pasta key, so I got that from that. So that's why I was here for it and she looked when she could have just came as herself.	
1	Yeah. Well, I'm going to say this I take back everything I said if Ali likes it I must be saying it wrong. Next up is Mona and I will accept that Ali is right and I am I love that we have to that's what makes this conversation. So interesting. You know, I love it. I'm sitting in the middle of all of it.	
3	She's like so for Monet, she's got this like plastic nude illusion thing and this is how you do a nude illusion Latrice as a great tights.	
1	Yeah again. Yeah, but did you look at the panties darker? She's wearing a darker brown. Yeah me for audio listeners and Ash Gray died.	
3	That's funny because I have that. Hkh, and I didn't notice that it was just better than because Latrice is nude illusion. Put such a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of my life that I was like, I was like a Monet she's doing well is but here's the question is she doing a nude illusion or she just chewed chose a fabric that was that color.	
1	You know what I mean? Like, I don't know that she was necessarily trying to do it illusion. I would just say, you know, it's statuesque or has a syllable. I'm referring to Latrice has thanked because I don't know that she was trying to do nude illusion. I think that was just the the colors that she chose like, I don't think that that's what they had in the band. Yeah. Exactly and sometimes you're working with this what's in the bin so she may have just been working with what was in the bin Monet her consistent Runway has always been this and I've seen it since episode one is the detail. Yeah. She has she has time like if you see this on the 4K that the shoulder Pat is completely Stone everything from head to toe is completely stoned no spots the details though. She had time. I'm she was waiting for it. This was another one that like Trinity that I was like, I like it. I don't love it. But I will say this I loved her makeup. I think that might be the best makeup. She's done seeing her is that she's not choking cares. Great. Yeah.	
3	Yeah next was Monique and she she had I was not getting Josephine Baker from this.	
1	I don't know something Baker to make are not I feel like the bananas. I got Chiquita. Banana. Yeah. Well the bananas with Manila meet leaders have like return them to her. Had most of them because they're missing on the back and they were in manila's basket on top and so they will share my banana bananas.	
3	You know, I wish she like if she was going to do a Josephine Baker like she's wearing this like plastic during the wrong time and plastic bottom with bananas tape to it. It's just it doesn't look like Justin Baker to me.	
1	It just looks like it looks like the Banana Boat Song but we all know we all have our bad days. Yeah. I ran into the brown cow studying this past week. Week and she's really sweet. Yeah, I was like hi. We talk shit about you. They usually no no, she wore brown cowboy hat. So I'm glad I know right?	
3	I feel like her runways are getting a lot weaker as the competition progresses and I feel like someone in the chat brought this up, maybe the runways her and moan. Well, I like Monet's but I feel like her Runway brought maybe the decision why they didn't win black hole to as well so that contributed to that and I just very disappointed by Monique Monique's looks this season. I feel like Monet is has stronger.	
1	Then make the season so I would wear I actually thought that she might end up in the bottom because of the look even though they did well in the challenge this was so bad. Like I like when she came around the corner. I was like are you freaking kidding me? I just I mean it was just it was just bad so bad and I love to somebody was like I like the finger wave hair, but it's like grow your stretching now when you're complimenting the wig nothing I was disappointed because	
3	I actually do like her runways. I have like two runways this season. And so this to me was a huge disappointment because I was expecting something. Well, yeah, you're right. I was expecting something really really cool and I got a plastic banana skirt, especially since she's such a crafty Queen. Yeah. She's able to turn out a dress like in like, yeah.	
1	All right exactly in the chat room that they keep hearing noodle illusion. Oh noodle. Times it's the noodle to say I'm coming in here and my product all little illusion. Wow.	
3	So Latrice and Trinity were the top two likely deserves a little dick in the soup though, because I felt Manila should have been with them. Yeah, I would replace Trinity with Manila personally.	
1	I wouldn't I thought they thought they deserved it and part of you know part of me wondered.	
3	Like were they doing this to make Manila mad? So like the next episode?	
1	Well, they weren't going to pin her against Latrice.	
3	Yeah.	
1	She just got back but I feel I felt bad for the tree species like, okay. What are we doing now? It's time for my time, too. Fine, you're gonna be doing a group challenge. She's like Fuck. This is why I would home the first time not going to let it happen again.	
3	So Latrice chose Valentina. Do you guys agree with her choice?	
1	Yes. Yes. Yes.	
3	She has like the team she held back Naomi and I felt bad like see you just didn't contribute but she thinks she said, you know, I didn't do anything make sure that we look sickening and that's surprising you think Valentina being very her ego. She would have taken over the	
1	Challenger maybe, but Naomi had to do it and you wouldn't think Naomi is like this like top Valentina is the girl who does nothing at the school project will put her name on them. So I was like perfectly. I just I felt like she when she was talking to both of them. I felt like in her head. She I mean we all know she lives in her own world, but I feel like she thought they're not going to send me home because of her relationship with them and because In her head she deserves to be in the finale that being said anybody, you know, it's like you can say that but then you can't say that Latrice can't think the same thing because that was the issue before was that Latrice is like why I've been around a long time. I deserve to be here. I shouldn't have gone home. Then you can't be mad. You didn't mean does that make sense? Well, thank you can't be mad at me choose for saying it and then B and then be okay with Valentina going we are well I shouldn't be because I'm fabulous well. Latrice is fabulous. I'm sorry Sheila made herself. I think yeah, absolutely. She said absolutely I didn't do anything. Yeah, we'll go. Well and even when she says give me a reason to keep you. She just said do what you think is best and I think that in when I heard that I went she thinks you're not going to send her home. So she's just telling you to do what you need is a great social player because she said yourself a few times. Yeah, but you know, the third time really wasn't her child in her favor. She wouldn't last one Survivor.	
3	Yeah. So the lip sync was you spin me round and Sorry, but usually Latrice it if you know you're going up against latrese you have to do at Trinity did right so you have to bring a gimmick because Latrice is going to slay a lip-sync. I was laughing so hard at Trinity that I felt like she didn't win. I see I see that was thicken the soup to me because I'm like, I feel like she should have won because it was so funny.	
1	I love the trees.	
3	I love my Teresa girl, but she also she should have lost her wearing those boots again.	
1	She wore them a gift. She wore those boots from the	
3	The not nude illusion nude illusion, but that's a lot about a queen - rely on a gimmick in order to defeat another good. Yeah, thank you so much.	
1	I didn't like the I didn't like driving that same thing last year and one she was blue for her finale. Look I know what you know, so y'all are being somebody's Queens over here.	
3	I was team Katya first and foremost for All-Stars to it's a gimmick Queen though like I love Katya, but that's what she does. Oh my God. I'm sorry.	
1	Yeah, we're back to let's play it even feel when it comes to all 124 Queen like a Pokemon. So yeah, it's know. I don't know. I didn't think that I don't understand why she didn't win. It was funny. I just don't think it matched the song. I think if it was a different song that it went with it would have won. I just it didn't make sense as soon as soon as she came out. I get that she was trying to do something different and show a different side of Trinity, which is fine. Fine, and I you know, and I encourage it but it should have been done with it. Just it didn't make sense for the song. It really truly didn't I mean if you can explain it to me and justify it I will take everything that I'm saying right now back, but you can't because it didn't fit the song. She didn't even like this in her 20s, at least she was in just in a dance costume and she just danced and she roll at least she rolled on the floor when they said you spin me right round like it made slack. I'm not saying it was phenomenal, but it just didn't it didn't work for me.	
3	That's just money. It first with the floppy tits. Yeah, you know, so I don't know. I just didn't care for it at all. Just I felt like it was reaching I didn't read it or I didn't like it. She was like cringing. Yeah, so read or just doesn't appreciate well label humor. Yeah.	
1	So there I will say this other this also is like it's like it for me. It's just like that standard joke. Let's take off the robe and have saggy boobs. You know, I mean, like I just really like I'm not saying everybody does it but I'm just saying like exactly what I'm talking about. It's just like it's kind of like that. I always used to say when I started doing drag I felt like every time I would go to drag shows before I see drag drag queens would do something and pull out a dildo and I remember starting to do dragon go I will do drag but I'm never bringing a dildo on stage like it was just like I was so tired of seeing it and again, I'm not saying, you know, you just brought up one person who did something similar to that. We've seen stuff like this before it's not new and creative had it been new and creative and fit the song. I would be all for it a hundred percent behind it. It just didn't make sense with the song. I just felt like she was reaching in trying to win the challenge which is the point you're trying to win the challenge. She reached into her bag of tricks and said I'm going to try this and see if it works and it well. I think that Trinity was giving her season 9 like reference but she was doing the Charlie hides. Yeah the whole pining and I thought I was funny. Yeah. Mmm, I didn't catch that. She should have just this Charlie heights. Yeah, well You just as try. Haha. That's funny.
