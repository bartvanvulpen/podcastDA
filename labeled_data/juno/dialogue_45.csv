3	All right, Brian, we're good. We're good to go right now. What's up, man? Not much man. Well, welcome to the dark Waters is this is the I guess the first one that I've done so far.	
1	Very cool. Very cool. I dig it. Yeah second podcast kicking off. Yeah and chatting again a little both of them.	
3	It means I like you.	
1	Hey, at least you're not calling me, you know four letter words, so we're good. It's cool, man. I dig it man. You been you been keeping busy.	
3	Yeah, dude, stay busy podcast man. Like I like talking to people and I figure if I just do one we can do to sure that gets most of the guess. I was having on my other podcast for Anglers. Anyway since like eventually my my my listeners on that side. I get tired of the same type of you know, guess or not get sick of it, but you know, yeah. Yeah, so it's nice to have something else that I could put	
1	People on and talk to you about some of the things I just like to talk about sure. Sure. I dig it.	
3	All right. Well, let's just go ahead we've done before just do an intro tell me who you are. What's going on? Just just brief to the point.	
1	Yeah, man, Brian Schiller Avid angle Paddle and fin podcast fishing tournaments. I like talking fishing just as much as you so yeah, I don't know.	
3	So I'm a big fan of paddle thing, which is what you know your podcast you've been doing for about two years now, I think yeah, it's like a year and a half probably a little more.	
1	It was a year in July. So yeah. Like a year and a half in some other start listening to the Yankees.	
3	That's just the time where I was only a lesion team and you were on it. And you were I guess you're trying to some content for them as well. That's kind of weird about your your your podcast and I've been a fan ever since.	
1	Yeah. We're in the Elysian t-shirt go figure. Yeah, man, you know, we just started off kind of is like fun, you know me and the guy that originally started it we call them we dubbed him The Godfather. He's no longer part of it, but him and I were both fans of podcasts. Just kind of got in the kayak fishing and always been longtime fisherman and we're like we were struggling finding information. So we figured hey this could be a cool way to help folks out that are in the same position as us and then that has now spiraled in I think we started out we were doing it like every three weeks and we went every two weeks then we went every week and now we have six different shows that run 5 Is a week and occasional bonus episode 6, you know for the Six-Day how do you know all your presents to all of them?	
3	But yeah, you got one two, three, four five six. There's like nine of us. Okay. I'm not and so are you like the ringmaster that Cirque is it kind of your circus? And those people are all your you know, so your monkeys.	
1	Yeah, you know, I like I told everybody man like I don't look at it as I'm the boss. - however, I'm kind of looked at as of the boss or the ringleader that term has been used several times before but you know, I the way we look at it, you know when we started and all these show segments we started calling it the paddle and fin podcast Network. So, you know, it's a bunch of people with the same kind of like minded. Thinking that all kind of collaborate together. However, yeah, I'm kind of the driving force. You know, I'm the guy that does all the editing uploading stuff like that. I mean a couple of guys help out with that a little bit, you know, we got Brad Hicks in a couple other guys that are starting to do like their own little YouTube videos. So we're throwing that on the channel. So I mean, it's always been derived about just like kind of getting information out there, but But yeah, I mean, it's tough man. Like I don't know what the hell I was thinking when we got into it. You know, like when I was like, oh, let's add another segment. Well, let's add another one and I know Jay who's you know, took over for the Godfather's spot? He was like you sure you want to do this dude, like well, yeah, why the hell not?	
3	Yeah and but it's not your advice to me. So yeah.	
1	Yeah, I mean, you know At first it was a little rocky just like trying to figure out a structure and and how everything was going to work out. But I think we kind of got that dialed in and you know, my theory is always been the more content the better right, you know, and it could even be about the same subject. But from somebody else's point of view on like a different show segment that definitely changes it up a little bit and it adds a little Flair to it. So it's cool. You know, I mean, I dig it. I know everybody else is having a lot of fun with it, you know, it's opened up some doors for for everybody on the on the crew that may not have necessarily had that opportunity so to speak so it's cool. Yeah. I mean, I don't know we're kicking butt.	
3	I mean it's obviously put out so much content. Sometimes I get lost and were so that that	
1	Big thing, right? So we get that all the time like I can't keep up with it. And you know, we've kind of designed it so we could touch on different aspects and I know from talking to folks like, you know, some people only tune in for certain segments other segments, you know, like like for example, you know, some of the more Advanced Anglers won't necessarily tune into the bass fishing for noobs segment, and that's based on like learning new techniques and stuff. Tough or they will if it's an angler they're interested in or maybe a new technique whatever. So there's something for everybody, you know and all different audiences like we got Susie that does hers and she's got a lot of women tuning into her segment that don't necessarily want to hear me ramble on about fishing, you know, so, it's cool.	
3	I did I kind of picked like I mean if I got to go home, but I try to listen to the show and because I'm good friends. Ryan online, I always listen to his new show and so I mean, yeah, I mean that's the thing is always something for someone and I guess it's not like a like one cop podcast. We got listen to every single episode, you know, Joe Rogan show or something like that. It's like you can kind of pick and choose. Yeah, like, you know, what works for you and that was kind of the theory behind it.	
1	Right? Like just just you know offering up that variety out there.	
3	When is this going to are I don't know depends on your boy right here. You gotta make me an intro so Okay that well.	
1	I will say this so after next week, what is next week December. It's like the week before Christmas. That'll be our last last week of shows and then we're taking two weeks off for the holidays. So that'll give you a chance to catch up and give me a little time to catch up on sleep and things like that when we just go real quick.	
3	I already kind of know like I've listened to your retro million times. I know you've been like a long time Fisher man. I know you used to do the bass boat sure, but they just go like this is more geared towards kayak fishing. Let's just go away why you decided to give up the the bass boat and why you decided by a piece of plastic and throw Learners from it?	
1	Sure. Sure. Sure. So man, it's kind of crazy that it starts way back when I was a kid. I was like and I was like 14 I I think a good friend of mine and myself we used to fish in Old gravel Quarry that was close to my house where I grew up and we're like dude we got to get off the bank. So we scraped up like a hundred some box and we bought an inflatable boat and we used to have like hike that thing on our backs on our bikes down to the lake which was a couple miles. Way and it was like dude. This is dope. You know, we got our own little boat and then you know as a kid growing up my old man had a 21-foot Skeeter. So, you know, I was kind of spoiled a little bit with that but graduated from the inflatable boat to a 15-foot Coleman canoe always loved fishing out of that man. It was just something different and yeah through the years I've had many different. Boats, you know bass boats small fishing boats ski boats cabin cruisers and then eventually, you know, my last boat before I got a kayak was a 16 foot aluminum Sylvan and I was running to my local Lake, you know, getting off work whatever. It was a pain in the butt back in the trailer into the garage launch of a boat by yourself. And here's a funny little story to on top of that. So back in the day used to run an outdoor website and was revolved around hunting and fishing and at one point we were going to sell new canoe and like I got I got all the emails between me and Blake young about like possibly starting some new canoes and you know, that was probably like 2008-2009. And I remember I found new canoe and I was like, this is dope. Like these boats are like virtually on the flippable. It's kind of like a canoe but a kayak and whatever and I lost touch to that. So when The Godfather was like Hey, I'm going to get a kayak man. Like I need to get out on the water. I was like, oh check out new canoe, you know, and then he bought a new canoe and I was like well shit, I need to get a kayak now. I ended up buying like a send 128 T only fished out of that thing like six times. I'm like this thing sucks because I couldn't stand in it. So I sold it to a kid that worked for me and then ended up buying a bona fide SS 127 and fishing out of that and It was cool because I could not venture out on Rivers which was something I didn't really fish. I could go on and lakes not have the hassle of you know trailer and a boat back in it in the water load it on the trailer by myself. All that stuff. Like I can just slide the kayak into the back of the truck and not only that man. It's just something about a kayak when you're in it and you're so close to the water and catching the fish. - man, I mean, I have a hard time always describing that two people and putting it into words like it's just different, you know, like you can explain it. It's way different than standing on the the bow of a 20-foot bass boat, you know compared to sitting in a seat or sitting in the chair of the Blue Sky, you know, it's it's just totally different and you got that whole solo aspect you can get in it. Tight waters, you know, that's the thing too like around me. I don't have a bunch of Stellar Lakes like you do in New York. I mean the Illinois, you know, so we do have some smaller bodies of water where you can't necessarily get like my 16-foot Sylvan boat into and things like that but a kayak or a canoe was essential, you know, that was the only way to do it. So just kind of jumped into that. You know fished out of the bona fide for a little bit and then this year jumped into the Blue Sky, which has been absolutely amazing and then just got put on the Jackson Kayak team.	
3	So saw that many actress like I'm not one to like I hate to debate and I'm not ever gonna debate like whatever the rules are. The rules sets are what the rule sets are. But like how do you feel like that blue sky, how is different from like a really kayak like me. I just do that. I don't give a shit if Uber says I can use you know sure what I mean like what are your thoughts on like makes it why do you have such a problem with it? So I just see a piece of plastic.	
1	I mean, it's just a piece of plastic as well that you can just stand on fish off of I mean sure so, you know, that's just it you said, you know, if Hoover says you fish out of it, you know and kbf, you know, why not, you know for me, I'm six-three six-four something like that. I'm a big dude. So I'm tall. The blue sky was a comfort thing for me like the first time I took it out, you know, I work part-time for a paddle shop. So one of my perks of the job, which is pretty Kick-Ass is I have a whole Warehouse full of boats, I could take out at any time out of like four different manufacturers. So, you know, I took the Blue Sky out this spring during the spawn out here and I was like, this is badass dude, like, you know, it's kind of that cross right between That Bass bout Vote in that kayak but for a comfort level plus it had a pedals Drive which was something that a bona fide didn't have things like that. It was unique it was different. I always liked being that odd man out. I guess I know I pissed a few people off by fishing out of that kbf this year. But you know, that's going to happen no matter what? Yeah. Now it's got the same propulsion is a majority of the kayaks. So you're the same there, you know a new canoe Frontier 12 is 43 inches wide and the blue skies 47. So your 4 inches wider. I think that Frontier 12 is like one of the widest kayaks in the market. I don't think there's anything 44 45. Do you have an advantage? Not really?	
3	I don't really sad only see one for it.	
1	Like I mean, it's there is some disadvantages, you know, it's bulkier. You got more more stuff to carry around you can still carry the same amount of gear. I don't I wouldn't say that you can necessarily carry more. Because I carry the exact same gear on the blue sky as I did in my bona fide my Bonafide I had a motor, you know, so I mean I get it like people are like, oh that's not a kayak and I'm always like yeah, you're right. It's it's not necessarily your traditional sit-on-top kayak. It's still in the kayak family. Yeah, I mean What's the difference to of like a kayak with stabilizer bars coming off the side of it compared to a blue sky now stabilizer bars your kayaks water than whatever. Yeah, so, I don't know man. I mean You know La I had a guy one of the tournaments this year. We're getting ready to launch and he's like that thing's not a kayak, but then he's taken off in a ho BPA 14. It's like that thing is just as stable as this blue sky and it's faster faster. I think I think most guys in a Hobie stair-stepping are getting like four and a half five miles an hour and I think I get like three point eight four miles an hour from This is steady pedal with that Jackson need Flex drive. So I don't know man. I mean to each their own. I mean the way I look at it is it's who cares at least I'm out fishing, you know, and not only that but like so the thing that really piqued my interest about it was last winter, you know, January fishing fishing show time up here in the north. We had a lot of older. Or folks walking in or booth going I could do that, you know because I'm not going to have a hard time getting out of the seat of a kayak that sits lower their like I could do this, you know guys got knee problems hit problem. So now you're opening the door to a whole new genre of Anglers, right? And that's what it's all about, you know, getting more people involved things like that guys are like, oh I could put that in the back of my pickup truck. You know, I could you know, that'd be a lot easier for transport compared to me struggling to put my 18-foot launder 20-foot range her on the trailer things like that. So I mean teach their own. I mean, I don't know man. I people are always going to be opinion opinionated about everything.	
3	Yeah, and then you that way everything the matter what like, yeah, I imagine imagine the first compound bow came out all the recurve nerds were It's not holding it. Yeah, exactly. We'll see I didn't that argument with my buddy.	
1	He's always like one of the guys that taught me a lot about fishing. He goes up north to to Ashland Wisconsin every year for Wisconsin gun season. He's like, come on man. You gotta go and I'm like that ain't Huntin dude. Anybody could pick off a deer with a 30 out six. I'm like I'm sticking to a bow bro. Like no thanks, you know, it's the same kind of thing, you know. No, I mean it's kind of like that purest mentality. Right?	
3	Well, I believe it I believe in rule sets if it's within the rules has been the rules if you don't like the way you don't like that rule set. There's another yeah competition competition there. Will that hopefully will meet your what you when you think should be allowed in a tournament. I bet as far as I'm concerned it's if you're the kdf that's just had Hoover's baby and it's his if you can buy into it if you want to but you know, it's his and he thinks it's okay then who am I to yeah, I mean Milo	
1	Cool Club here. They won't allow it. They might next year. I don't know. I'm waiting to hear and you know, I haven't really looked into the rules of the Hobie series or this new Vass series. I don't know if they allow it. Yeah, I'm sure they do. I know Hobie doesn't allow motors which makes them unique a lot of guys like that. It's keeping it all too human driven to to you know, kind of level that playing field. I like that rule but again, like that's not going to deter me from you know fishing kbf. I mean I fished against guys would Torpedoes all year last year. Did it really make a difference? No, I don't think so. And that's that's one thing right like you got to boil it down. Like it doesn't matter what boated it. You're anybody's in it's it's the skill of the angler that's going to matter at the end of the day when you're when you're talking from a tournament. Point of view right?	
3	We gotta know the deal when you get to the whatever area you're going to yeah, right great.	
1	I mean I could have all the coolest gear and gadgets doesn't mean I can catch a fish. You know, I could have every bait known to man but doesn't mean I'm gonna hook 5 Pounders all day, you know, so I don't know man. It's just one of those things. I think it's just another thing for for folks to kind of turn their nose at and kind of bitch a little bit.	
3	I just I just think people in general like I think it's just a it's a weird. That people just like the bitch sometimes. Yeah like this morning. I came here. Why was bitching my wife? It wasn't for really any good reasons. I'm just doing it the sake of doing it. I think that's just like a human nature like just sure it's true. We find a reason to bitch about anything. I mean, yeah, you're totally right. It's human nature man, you know like God was bitching about work today, and I'm like, what am I doing?	
1	I just need to get this done so I can go home, you know take a nap and then record a podcast and I would Josh Smith.	
3	let's go back to the what was your What was your attention with a podcast at first when you first got into it? What were you really trying to do with it? Um the under listening, I think I remember when I first are listen you guys it's more like we're all in this together and we're all kind of just learning as we go and you know, as we're going as we're learning different techniques and you were sharing them as you want if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	
1	It was all about education dude, because you know, you know Scott and I when we started AKA The Godfather started the podcast We struggled to find information like there wasn't great Outlets. I mean there was some Outlets like Alex full Gary has a lot of pretty good reviews on his YouTube channel. Definitely ran across Hoover things like that, you know, and and that's a thing right now like our Market is so flourished with choices and opportunities. You're just like where do I go? You know and and can you really trust what you read online? And that's where I ran into trouble when I bought my Ascend, you know, I trusted what some folks that online and it ended up being total horseshit and I found my local kayak shop. Now. I worked there part-time, you know, they really educated me about boats and and things like that and you know, when we started the podcast, yeah, I mean I could tell you about fishing, you know, some fishing techniques stuff like that. You know how to fish structure, you know nonsense like that, but I didn't know a lot about you know the kayak and so it was a good way for us to learn at the same time. Our listeners were learning and now yeah, I mean, I probably spend way too much time following everything that goes on in the kayak fishing Community, you know, I could probably name off specs on Many different boats that are just stupid and nobody cares about you know, they were feel like I got like that for a while.	
3	I've just recently like calm down but like like you get like you start looking to like this useless knowledge. Yeah. It was like talking to someone you're like talking to him just like this knowledge.	
1	Yeah, and not only that but like Out of that stuff is just knowledge. I've gained from just talking to guests on our show, you know of I've talked with some of the like the big. Innovators and in our community, you know Drew Gregory. He designed the Kusa, you know, and you know talk to Luther ciphers, you know before he merged bona fide with what does that Big Adventures native, you know, I talked to all kinds of people Anglers, you know that are in any different kind of boat, you know, I got a buddy just an hour north of me. And he's fishing out of a Johnny boat now because he can use that for duck hunting in the fall in the winter. You know, you put a mud tiller on that thing. So it's kind of interesting like these little plastic boats that we all kind of fell in love with are being utilized for so many different things. You know, you got you know, we just added our saltwater segment and that's something that's always fascinated me because I've never fished the ocean.	
3	I've seen the ocean I grew up on the saltwater fishing.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, okay. So so I've seen pretty much the whole Atlantic coast of seeing the gulf. I've seen the Pacific Ocean in California. I've never fished any of those spots once swam in it did all that but I've never ever fished it and so that that totally fascinates me in I'm supposed to be popping my cherry on that down on the gulf with my man Dustin Nichols. down there in Texas coming up, you know early spring but yeah, man, it's crazy, you know the different aspects but that's the thing right like podcast started out and I started to learn all these different things, you know, find out guys are getting dropped off 20 miles out off sure actually like, you know, huge grouper and sailfish and whatever the hell else, you know, you know going to You know guys that are just it was a form for them to get off the bank and go catch some crappies off some sunken trees. You know, I think all that school, you know, I mean, I've talked to Steve Carrell up in Idaho I missed a trip up there with Jay this year dudes catching sturgeon, you know, eight nine foot sturgeon out of a freaking kayak dude. Yeah, you know Jay was up there the end of August I was supposed to go with them, but I was between some some kbf. Tournament so I couldn't make it up but in I think it was like five days J caught over 200 feet of sturgeon, you know, like that's just insane bro 200 eat a fish unlikely.	
3	Is that correct? Really that crazy because I'm up here in like the upstate New York. We got yeah, we got a we got obviously you gotta look great like to well, we got up Ontario up here and like wrote we got these huge like I'm from the Gulf Coast so I know everything about the saltwater fish. I'm still kind of new to this, but we got like Fucking the all the different kind of salmon got these Bullhead like he's definitely trout fishing and stuff like that and like they're catching these these fish on kayak because I thought there was out there bass fishing on the river one time at the mouth of the river and I guess the salmon and the thing is I think it's bullshit your head still here getting ready to run him out there a little bass boat. Those dudes hook into something huge and I watch is dragging them around me. Oh, yeah run ahead the river like This is I want that and they pull it up. I'm like dude. That's gotta I gotta catch one of those in my kayak. So yeah next season because the seasons pretty much over everything's getting Frozen right now. We're getting prefer ice fisherman. Next season. I'm gonna I'm gonna Branch off of bass fishing just for a little bit and like especially those colder months when the bass start going deeper. And so yeah hit those things because you're right like it's there's so much more like I think a lot of times and especially the kayak Bass Fishing where we get so like pinpoint especially Slugger bats. Right or alternate bass and you always wanted wasn't a practice how you train how you fish in the tournament? But like I think next year, I'm going to Branch off just a little bit and try to catch some of those big things on a kayak sure. Sure. Sure.	
1	So, you know Jay Randall my co-host, you know, he's on the Jackson team as well him and I have become good friends. We live like an hour away from each other, but you know this year I was like come on bro fishing tournaments with me and he's like no I want to fish for other stuff he loves. Fishing for northern pike and you know lo and behold the ended up fishing for mostly bass this year. But you know, he he wanted to Branch out and fish some different stuff and I get it now. I understand why because like you said, you're you're in tournament mode all year long. So all you think is bass bass bass bass, you know, I love catching walleye. Do there's nothing tastier in my frying pan than a fresh Walleye out of Green Bay.	
3	I know me too, but But I caught a few walleyes when I was out there getting ready to catch, you know, I'll try to Bass I got mad the wall I come to I'm trying to catch bass. Yeah, right Creek, you know, it's the same thing for me to like I'll catch Pike or crappie or something.	
1	You know, I'm tossing a Ned rig in them. I'm catching 12-inch crappie and I'm pissed off, you know, like if it wasn't like tournament pre-fishing I'd be happier than hell you know, so that's the thing like next this coming season. I am going to fish some tournaments, but I'm not Going to do it. Like I did this last season just because you know, I got some personal trips that I can take that are open to me next season that I don't want to pass up like sturgeon fishing. You know, I've been invited back up to Idaho I missed it this year. So I definitely want to do that definitely want to go fish the ocean for red fish and sea trout would Dustin Nichols, you know, we Did something recently with Josiah Pleasant up in Juneau, Alaska, I have an opportunity to go up there. So I mean Alaska is a bucket list thing for me. Like I'm not passing that up. There is no way in hell. I don't care if my wife is going to take the kids and leave me.	
3	I'm going to Alaska, you know like yeah, it's gonna be epic.	
1	Yeah, so, I mean that's not set in stone. But you know, that's just it like, you know, I Like I said, I understand where Jay was coming from now, like, you know all I thought about fishing last year was bass and I mean they're there is more species out there than just bass. Don't get me wrong. I love catching bass and love figuring them out. There's definitely a passion there but you're talking about salmon and steelhead runs we get that here in Lake Michigan and I used to be a heavy heavy fly fisherman because of that, you know, I bought a cheap A little fly rod. I read some Forum that that salmon were running into this River and I had a chance of catching them on a fly rod. I went up there dude and hooked into a 17-pound king on a $40 fly-fishing combo strip the gears out of the real and I'm like, I'm freaking in dude. I fought that fish for like a half hour dude, you know wading through the water running up and down the bank's, you know, so I didn't lose it and that's Then I miss you know, you know like this time of year. I remember when the hell was that. I think it was like 2011. We had a New Year's Eve that was like 40 degrees 45 degrees in the river was open up there in the brown trout will sit in there in the river because they follow the Kings Inn in there trying to write and to eat the eggs and we went up there. Do you not call it like five Brown's over 26 inches and I got these things dude. Pictures of them they look like submarines like just just tanks and catching fish like that on a fly rod dude, that's like catching a Musky on an ultra-light, you know, I mean, it's just words can't explain it and there is a guy that he's out of either out of Milwaukee or Racine, Wisconsin. Rob Wendell is his name check that dude out. He he fishes Lake Michigan at tan dude, and I just saw some pictures. He caught like a 20-pound Brown that dude is caught some Kings and Cohoes that are just massive same thing with steel heads, you know, the steel heads will kind of sit outside the harbor this time of year and guys will ice fish for him. Once the harbor safe enough to get out on you know on the ice and they'll catch huge steel heads. Brown's through the ice, which is just crazy men, Erica. Taja is a guy that you know, he fishes out of a boat. He's done some YouTube videos with Alex parekh and John be couple of the Google guys and you can see some of the fish. They'll go out there in the summer jigging Forum wood Plastics catching them that way but he also does I strips like that's stuff I want to do man like	
3	You know, there's a problem. We'll go into the 2019 season and talk about actually the charge but just like the kind that we're saying it's like we get so hooked on like one thing that we forget. Yeah whole because the thing is like, oh one thing I realized this year's it's so hard to be, you know on the top tier of like competitive bass fishing. It should be easy, but you're gonna try and you're gonna put like a lot of effort a lot of sacrifice your, you know, every time you go to the lake over to the river. Whether your pre fishing or just in your home like you're practicing. Yeah for those tournaments at all times and I think oh, yeah a lot of times like when you do that you miss out on like really cool experiences of like looking into you know, yeah a greater than Pi or tiger. Muskie or sure that because I mean, whatever I can we see our own like if you know if you want if you want to be Champion the world at kayak Bachelors, I'm not sure what's gonna get you in the long run. But after this season and we'll talk more about our seasons is Your but I guess this is I can't learn it like it's okay not to be like super competitive in the go out and do things that are that are just fun. Like I'm missing out on like a lot of fishing a lot of cool places because yeah, you know instead of like going out and go to these places. I really want to see I was going to go six hours of pre fish here six-hour Dupree fish. They're sure to get ready for these tournaments and then you know, I think next year like you I kind of want to I still want to compete I still want to do these tournaments, but I also want to have a good Damn good time. And yeah, it get some good life experiences, you know.	
1	Yeah. I mean, I got to fish. Excuse me. I got to fish a lot of cool different bodies of water. One of them was a bucket list Lake for me this year Table Rock Lake down in Missouri, you know, I've wanted to fish that since I was a kid, but when you add that Competitive Edge on it, it kind of takes that Adventure out instead of like kicking back relaxing and enjoying that body of water. You know, I was so Focused on trying to find fish Granite. I was limited on pre-fishing time and stuff. That's a whole nother story. But you know, I love that adventure of going out and exploring new bodies of water. And that was something I did last year, you know, like I fished a lot of different water last year and it was a lot of fun because it wasn't a competitive thing and I was going out fishing with like my buddy Jay The Godfather few other guys and this cheer You know, I did meet some new friends fishing the kbf trail, which was great. But you know at the same time you're so focused on finding those quality fish and not just going out and catching fish. Right? Like I'm the type of guy where I'd rather go out and catch a hundred fourteen fifteen inch fish then like five 20s, you know what I mean? Yeah, five 20s would be cool, but I'm an action guy. You know, I just love catching fish. Yeah, you know, so that's the thing, you know, but I know there's guys that love the fact it just going out and finding Giants. I mean don't get me wrong. I love catching Giants but you know to sit on one spot for 8 hours to catch five Big Fish. It's not that exciting. I mean, it sounds exciting but it's real. It's really not dude.	
3	It ain't stayed know about that. That's how you went tournaments though. Yeah, right exactly. Yeah, and that's just it.	
1	I mean, you know, I had some scenarios this year where you know, I just fish them spots because I knew there was fish there. I neither wasn't winning fish. There was like screw it. I'm going to catch fish. I'll do half way decent, you know, but you know it is what it is man.	
3	This is what I love about our season like I think me and you both this is our first first real estate that I started kind of fishing before that and I dabble but like the trails night. Citizen season I did anywhere between two to three tournaments a month. I was all over the Northeast. I think there's more to to of the kbf do whatever reasons but still I got was in it to win it. This season didn't win shit, but that was definitely the with it but you know talking about you and your Sakai know you kind of the same thing and you did a really good job at least put content about like, you know, like your podcast always talk about what tournament you fished in you know, how What day is getting? It's always good to hear that especially especially when we don't do that. Well, it's always cool to put up because yeah, he's easy to talk about kicking ass. It's important to talk about getting your ass kicked. I didn't hear sure.	
1	She's totally dude.	
3	Totally. What were your things that you took away from the 2009 this being your first season where some of the things that you learn and some of the things that you're taking with you to the 2020 season.	
1	She's how long we got, you know, you know I started Just knocking it dead this the beginning of the Season, you know, like so my goal wasn't necessarily to win. I just wanted to be in the top 10 and every tournament I fished and I started out that way, you know, but as some things with work changed and in work adding on all these segments on of the podcast like yeah, I was overloaded with work and I wasn't focused on fishing tournaments towards the end of the season and I'm not necessarily using that as an excuse, but I kind of am because I wasn't as focused as I should have been or I was like the beginning of the Season, you know, so the big thing is is like in and part of it towards the end of the To was like I was kind of in contention for a little bit for Rookie of the Year and angler the year in my division. So like I started worrying about that, like don't worry about that crap. It don't matter, you know, and that's the thing. It just just go out and have fun. Like if I was to recommend somebody that was just getting into it just go out have fun talk to guys meet new friends meet new Anglers. You talk as much fishing as you can absorb as much information as you can and just take taken the experience. I mean, that's what it is. You know, the the camaraderie and the kayak fishing Community always talk about that how it's just so cool. Everybody's willing to share knowledge. And that's one thing that I definitely learned like that is 100% legit true and I learned a lot of stuff this year, you know just Talking with some of the guys, you know, they were talking about techniques that they were fishing that I never even liked considered like a Shaky Head drop shot and stuff like that and I started fishing those things more and it was put more fish in my boat. So, you know, you gotta kind of kind of go at it with an open mind and don't stress out about all the crap, you know, the aoy race the the money no stuff like that just go out and have a good time. I think for me, you know to so I go ahead no. No, go ahead.	
3	I agree. We don't agree with you. I think the biggest part that I learned was like do not go into a fishing term in with huge expectations. Sure thing is the thing is the best fisherman there is probably not going to win. Yeah. Yeah, you know, you don't know who's awake like there's a lot of skill that goes into it, but there's also a lot of I want to call it look but you are you're kind of playing the lottery. That was that was that a good spot and with a good spot yesterday and it's gonna be a good spot Tomorrow. There's all these things that playing affect. It's like sure you got it. Sure would like to see I'm gonna go there and I'm going to try to catch as many and his biggest fish. I possibly can but I like your kind of attitudes like you need to go there and just have a good time. Yeah, enjoy being water enjoy being around the community and are staying like this isn't like a sport like basketball or football or we're all you know, If like the for some kind of weird chant, I know we're like you don't really have a say-so what the day is going to like how the day is going to go use go out there and like and try to fish your best learn and take this shit with you to the next term to put like if you go in there we like these high expectations. I believe least for me it happen to me at Lake Anna some other places you're going to miss out on a whole different kind of experience of just like being around a bunch of cool attitudes, or I'm sorry a quest Quest people in general, you know, whether you like to drink beer. There's people drink Here with there's a lot of people go out to eat dinner with the people you want to be sure. I'm it'll I'm at so many good people this season. Yeah, you know people you probably be lifelong friends. I don't know but like it may just take it was that was the part. I wish I would have focused on more instead of like just the grind in the crazy. You know, like when we like they're not gonna win if you win it's gonna be a surprise to you. I promise no for sure man.	
1	I mean, that's just it like so my first kbf tournament was down in Kansas and I remember pulling up to the Ramp for practice the first day when I got out there and Sam Jones and Alan Reed were at the ramp two guys from Indiana and we kind of chatted a little bit and and it was the paddle and fin sticker on the back of my truck and Alan reads, like battle and Finn is that you and I was like, yeah, how you doing when over talk to him had a conversation talk that way in you know, we all talked like I'll see you at the next one. Then next thing, you know Madison chain, we're all camping together. It was me Sam Jones Alan Reed Dylan Fuqua his dad, you know, then next thing, you know next stop. We're all renting a house together, you know, going out to breakfast eating dinner together, you know, rig and our stuff up at the end of the night, you know, those experiences right there made every single penny. I spent fishing last year worth it. You know what I mean? What I took away from it, you know, and you're totally right dude, like it could be anybody's day. It could be anybody's day. You know, I mean, you know, I had some top 10 finishes. I cashed couple checks this year. I want a big bass for the day down at Table Rock, you know, so that those were cool experiences, you know, but, you know, like like Madison chain dude, I started out leading the day like, I don't know. So like after the first I think it was after the first hour. I was leading all the way up till Dylan the fifteen-year-old kid whooped my ass, but you know, like like that's just it like I was on a hop bite conditions change that sun came up the clouds cleared my bike shut off what he was doing was, you know fishing beds and that was consistent. I'll pay for him, you know, so, I mean, that's just it that's that's fishing right and its raw form like it is always ever-changing do too. Conditions temperatures whether you know, it's goddamn fish Temper Temper. Yeah, and whoever whoever knows how to adjust to those changing factors is the guy that's going to come out or gal that's going to come out on top, you know, so it goes from a lot of Seasons That's not just once the that's a lot of experience. Yeah a ton of experience dude. I mean, yeah, don't get me wrong. Like I got quite a bit of experience, you know fishing for multi species. Sometimes I know how things are going to affect but you know, that's the thing to write like I'm fishing different bodies of water that that might be my first time ever on that body of water and trying to be able to figure out that change not going to happen. Whereas if you get like a guy like Josh Stewart on Kentucky Lake, which he's grown up on his whole life that guy probably knows Kentucky Lake like the back of his hand, you know, he could probably draw a topo map of that whole life. For you just off a memory. Yeah, you know he knows how that's going to change and she you know, so he's going to be able to adjust but it still dude. He's lost tournaments on his home body of water. So I mean, it just goes to prove your point that you know, yeah, you know things are changing and guys are going to stumble across something and you know, it'll be their day for sure.	
3	Well, I think I yeah the kind of biggest, you know, something about us like Especially like, you know this kind of competitiveness or it's kind of a competition is like it's all about your toolbox. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you can't one skill set doesn't win this. It's a lot of stuff, you know, and I was lucky enough this year I get to meet up and if you get hit I think he won Rookie of the Year and the KB KB Africa the year Derek Bond o but I was yeah, I was lucky enough to meet him in our first KB of Trail we became friends and they said no I'm hanging out his camper and his wife's cooking his food and that's it. Now now I'm good friends with guy. Who's Really really good fishing, but it's like because I know him because I was you know that the experience I had with him. Now. I have these different to like, you know, they can she show me things that now I can take you to the next season sure. They I'm hoping next season. I me some other cool dudes or whatever and you my toolbox is Keith growing and growing and I think that's what fished it's if I think fishing is a patient game like you really have to be patient. You can't have her take this expectation either had to start skill that you need to win that day. Or you know, there's those things in your toolbox. It's or you don't but the the opportunity to always learn to get better.	
1	It's always there sounds like you've been listening to the paddle and fin podcast my man big dude, I talk about that all the time, you know, like when me and Scott started out, you know, we kind of picked like three techniques that we were going to work on which which was a concept we picked up from another podcast that I listen to and I wish those guys will put out more shows they're out. The West Coast with the heck is it I can't think of it right now off the top of my head, but I'll look it up but you know learning a couple new techniques every year is so key because now you're adding more and more to Your Arsenal Yak tactics podcast good dudes out there and that was something they talked about on one of their episodes and you know Scott and I did that and you know like this. This year one of the things I worked on was a Shaky Head dude, and I freaking crushed it on a Shaky Head this year.	
3	I learned that a little bit too late. I wish I would have yeah the season but that's the next season. I'm going to leave let's be like my technique that I really focused.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, but you know talking about Derek brundle. I got to meet him a bit kbf Trail Championship up here in La Crosse and that's when he sealed the deal on Rookie of the Year. Hear me and Sam Jones were in the running with him. I know Danny Uribe was in that running from California, but he didn't come out for that. So, you know, he kind of got knocked out because he can make the trip out to to Wisconsin. But you know, Derek's a good dude. He definitely crushed it this year man, you know, we crack some jokes with him, you know, we told him we were running and gunning for him and you know, we were going to track them down and maybe take the tires off. His truck so he couldn't make it to the launch the next day to give us a chance, you know, you know just stupid stuff like that. But you know that again going back to the tournament thing, you know, this is guy. I never met and were cracking jokes talking about, you know, competing against each other and it's all in good fun. You know what I mean? So and I'm totally proud of that dude for for the accomplishment he achieved this year man that it is not an easy task, you know, he's coming on the show on Sunday night. Awesome. Nice. Do heck. Yeah, man.	
3	So what we'll wrap this thing up, but I just wanna ask you, you know, since now 2019 season is over. What are we doing in the offseason? I mean, I know I know I know the pedal spanner busy.

From Alabama and Sam Jones and we talked about you know all the options for next year what we're all planning on fishing and things like that. I'm I'm not going to be as serious about Tournament Fishing next year. I'm kind of like I said focusing on some other trips and I'm focusing on some some media Avenues and and some media Focus. So yeah, I'm working on that next year. I'm just kind of taking A step back. I mean this year was more of a where do I stand, you know as an angler for me, which I think I ended up like overall for angler of the Year race. I was like 34th 3436 any bat out of it like a thousand people. Yeah, I mean Granite like, you know half of those people are three-quarters of those people only fished one or two tournaments. But yeah, man, I mean that was a huge thing and that was that was one of my goals going into it. I wanted to be in the top And I ended up being in the top 40 so it was a huge goal for me and I'm proud of that and I will take that to the bank Sam Jones got lucky and beat me by two spots that son of a bitch. But yeah, man it, you know again man just for those listening just go out there and have fun enjoy. It don't don't want the money and the ego thing gets here. Just just go.
