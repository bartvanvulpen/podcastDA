3	Hey everybody. This is how you are. I just want to talk to you a little bit today about some happen to me the other day and they've asked me if I tell you about it just because it kind of changed my life. I think it'll change your life. It changed his life changed my aunts life changed everybody's life. So I was down at My Cousin Skeeter shop. But today I walked in there and I was trying to steal couple parts because my Ford ain't working right and Skeeter walk in he didn't know I was doing two skaters kind of stupid and he was like, hey bud. I got something I need to tell you want to take a seat right there. Tie a seat right there. He said I want to tell you about something that I found out they if you haven't heard about it. I think it's wrapped right time. You did. He says it's called anchor and it's the easiest way imaginable to make podcast and I was like, well, that's like Skeeter. All right. Well, I'm you got my you have my curiosity got my attention. But so he said well, let me talk to you about it. He said it's free. There's creation tools on it. They allow you to record. Edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer and it will distribute your podcast for you. So it can be heard on Spotify on a podcast many other things many more many more platforms. You can make money from podcast no minimum listenership. It's everything you need to make podcast in one place. And I started thinking about it and I ain't never heard Skeeter say none of these words before so obviously it took to him pretty well.	
1	It must be pretty important to him.	
3	So I just want to come on here and tell you that you should download anchor today and you know, just just do with it what you want to do man. Just just have a good time with it. My cousin skaters making a podcast now and he just is just having time with life with it. And you know, I keep stealing his Parts but he's making money from anchor and it kind of offsets it all so he can keep Even and he can feed his kids and family and all that stuff right there. So it's a download anchor Today and and maybe maybe you can be you know the next Skeeter. I don't know.	
2	Following total Atomic Annihilation the rebuilding of this great nation of ours may fall to you. That's why we here at fault boys. WB will take you on an orator of the beautiful state of West Virginia. There's no other place to be better prepared for the impending fall out. Now we go live to our team of experts.	
1	Hello and welcome to Vault boys WV a mutated podcast crossbreeding our shared history and Appalachia post-apocalyptic State and fall. 76 I'm Your Country Road scholar Dave chaffins and joining me is my favorite son of a moth man. Austin O'Connor. How you doing, Austin?	
3	What's up? What's going on man?	
1	Nothing much. We went on our mandate this past week that we did we did that we did solve interest in game. No spoilers. We're not going to spoil anything. I don't want to I would only want to talk about it just because I don't even really get into like Game of Thrones either because we had a whole tangent last time. I'm and I know right before this podcast we talked for about 25 minutes about Game of Thrones. So I've got her I've gotten you I've gotten that out of your out of your system good. Oh, that's good. It's a good talk Boba Fett kills Commander Shepard.	
3	I yelped Yelps like five times during the episode like horribly. My living room alone yelped.	
1	What what restaurants were you reviewing?	
3	Hi. I howled I hollered I screamed you wolf. Yeah, I whooped whoopty whoop.	
1	Well, we had a nice little nice little mandate the only problem until you like sprained your ankle. Yeah, I got up so we sat on the front row the movie theater with well, it's not really the front row second T, right. It was like right at the front of the walkway. So we had like bar so we could like put her feet up on and it was nice because we can leave we can leave as we pleased. Yeah. Well you you had to go pee I dehydrated you. Can you stop? Drinking water at work. Yeah. Yes. I made sure that I did not have to pee the whole movie and I got I think I got a so did I guess soda I think so de popcorn. I think twice twice during the movie. But the first time I got up depth perception didn't work and so the floor where it wasn't where I thought it was and so it's like it's during a scene I get up I go over the corner and I just land on my ankle fun.	
3	And then I'm in front of the theater like living and living in my own shame and then I walk I'm I'm slowly limping because it all I saw was like out of the corner of my eye your silhouette just drop really quickly and I look and I just See Your Shadow just hobbling slowly but like with and I could see your face for a split second. You were like, okay, just keep going.	
1	Well. I know how to get out of the vision of these. People who like booking it, but in the most painful way possible because these people are here to enjoy this movie and we had the person from the theater which I've never seen I've been to be I was weird plenty of times and this guy comes in and gives us the speech. That's essentially everyone if I see you using your cell phone from in the booth. I'm going to come down here and take it away or throw you out and make sure to respect your neighbor and don't talk about spoilers if you if you see if you've seen the movie. I've seen this movie three times and it's the greatest film I've ever seen.	
3	Yeah, it was like if if I see I'm gonna have to bring you out. We're have to look at every photo and your phone and make sure you didn't take any video jokes on him, right? All I have is 33 thousand pictures of Jason Alexander in my phone. So he would have been really upset but our is that for the memes? Yeah, because he looks like Jon Snow Jon Snow looks like him I've seen that mean if you like.	
1	I'm up to date on my Mimi's.	
3	Your movies, but listen, I want to talk about something real quick that happen to me over the weekend. Okay, so as you know, and as everybody else knows I had fun encounters with Spirits with the supernatural okay in my time. So, okay. I went to one of my one of my really good friends weddings in Virginia and I was the photographer for the wedding, right and we it was up. We stayed in the Eastern panhandle of West Virginia. So I was up around Harpers Ferry, but the wedding was near win.	
1	Esther right Winchester, if you want to know more about Harpers Ferry, you can listen to our last steps.	
3	Yes exactly. What was that work? Exactly? Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, Sean Connery down here. I drove up on Friday the morning after we saw Ventures and we it was me and two of my friends they were both in the wedding and we had no idea where we were going and I've never been to Winchester, Virginia. I've been near it because I whenever I go to DC.	
1	I cut off 81 cut up just before Winchester, but right and you take that that like passageway that there's not any traffic on and you avoid all that Richmond. Oh, yeah situations.	
3	So I-95 we text the bride and say Hey Taylor. What's the address? We don't know where we're going. So she sends the address first. We took the wrong road because it told us to go left and we were like this is definitely not it so then we come down and we're like, well, this is the only other thing that makes sense, but it was this big Huge mansion and it was gated like there was a gate out front and you go up and there is like a covered little Dome with the pillars around it. I don't know what you would call it like a gazebo kind of like a gazebo but like very it was very open. I don't know if it but it was like a it was like a very solid structure not like a screened-in anything or anything.	
1	I pergola says sort of I don't know.	
3	It's the Greenbrier has one with like the little spring and like the oh a gazebo. Whoa, is it a gazebo is? Yes a gazebo? Okay, we'll say a gazebo. Yeah, and there was just like this creepy statue under it and all this stuff and then and it's called historic Jordan Springs. Okay. I don't know. I'm sure someone's heard of it. And it's this big L-shaped like three or four story mansion. Beautiful and beautiful house very very historic looking it's called historic Jordan Springs. So we roll up and we go inside and just immediately all of us get this weird feeling just like like we all felt it there were about four of us total that arrived at the same time. We're like man it this is kind of weird. It's just a heavy feeling and they're like, okay so the man cave where all the groomsmen will be getting ready and you can you can all put your stuff down there. For now all we do the rehearsal as well. It's downstairs in the basement. So we walk down in the basement and it just keeps getting worse. The inside of the house is beautiful. It was it was really beautiful and and the man cave was really it has like a nice big pool table and like autographed guitars on the wall and a bar and like little girl stuff very nice. And then I was like, okay. Well, I'm gonna check out I'm gonna keep going down this hallway and you're like in a dungeon basically, but the chapel the end or Chapel was in the basement because on the side of the house the house is sort of built into a hill. So even though you're in the basement, once you get to the chapel, there's a door that goes outside. So it's not totally it makes sense. Like it's not bad but we did the rehearsal and everything. I just took the longest way to get to this though, but I went to the event coordinator after the rehearsal and I was like, hey man, you know is this place is this place haunted at all? I was like, you know, I know you work here and you're here every way do you ever experience things and its name is cult cult Colt and he goes well, you know a lot of us here, we're kind of skeptical of it were Skeptics most of the things that we hear can be pretty easily debunked, you know, an old house creaks different, you know, heating and cooling systems and stuff and a lot of it a lot of a lot of things echo through the house. So we'll hear voices but it's someone you know may be on the other side of the house and the vent system and he had all these explanations. He was like, but truthfully I've never really had that much happen here that has scared me asked him when the house was built. All states back to the 1600s. Hmm.	
1	So I was like, okay stories not matching up now cold because I know this place has got to be haunted with that much time 1600.	
3	So and then before that it was a Native American they had like a little village there because it was the Springs Sulphur Springs and they they thought they were healing powers and all this stuff. And then the white man came and did what they did like always and we're like, hey, this is ours now. I don't buy cult story. I think Colts trying to sell us.	
1	Listen. This is where	
3	it gets good. So we go to the rehearsal dinner and we're all kind of talking about it, right? So I look up online historic, Jordan Springs. The first result I saw was Discovery Channel when ghosts attack historic Jordan Springs, Virginia, and I was like this man coat called strike old. All right, so I click on another video of like a history of a paranormal investigation, right? And who do I see front and center in the video given an interview another than cult again, here's called talking about all the stuff that's happened to him in this house and how everybody's had an experience and I'm like, all right.	
2	All right.	
3	All right Cole. I'm on to you now because you sat there and you told me and you just you said that this wasn't a haunted place and I get on Al Gore's internet and I see you front and center telling me that this place is haunted. So there's two conflicting stories. And so I get there the next day and I got there a little early because I was the photographer and I was going to get set up and get everything ready. So I'm I'm thinking you know, I bet everybody's down in the chapel and they're getting everything ready. So I walk downstairs into the basement check the man cave. Nope lights are turned off. Nobody's there getting a little nervous. I'm in the basement by myself at this point. I go down this hallway take a right you go down and I'll show you the picture real quick of what it looks like I go down this hallway. I look down the other hallway to the chapel doors are closed lights are off all of a sudden the light goes off where I am. So I'm in this basement terrified. It's dark it's dark.	
1	Oh, no cellphone service at all in the basement or just in general in the whole area the house itself.	
3	You get outside the house full, you know full bars in like one spot and then let you take three steps no service. So this is what I see. Okay lights go out that's in the basement of the house. Okay, very old as you can see ya this.	
1	Yeah, it looks like something you would find in. Oh, what's that game Amnesia Dark Descent.	
3	That's what I there was also a rope right here roping this section off in the chapel was over this way, and then all the lights just turned off. So I have like 30 pounds of camera equipment on me. Hmm sprinting through the house back up the steps, so It was pretty terrifying. I won't lie to you. It was actually very very terrifying experience. But it's funny some of the wedding pictures. There are orbs all over the place in these picture got them orbs, man. Oh, I don't know. I'm still going through the photos, but there are maybe they could sell that venue differently. Have you thought about the well, they that's what's funny is there's like there's like a like a Secret website for them. That's still official by them, but it's like a secret called. Haunted historic Jordan Springs. There's historic Jordan Springs at Compton. There's one it's like haunted historic towards right and it's and they sure were talked about the Paranormal investigations.	
1	Yeah, if you want like a pair because like people like having like the theme weddings and paranormal wet and it was I mean, it was a beautiful place for a wedding. It would be gorgeous figure lister's are in the northern Virginia area. I will check it out. They want one of our pieces of mails from a guy from Northern Virginia. I'm sure he's probably heard of it.	
3	It's probably have but if they do tours, it's a Like I said, I recommend checking it out, especially if you're into creepy things because it's beautiful. There's a lot of history there. A lot of presidents have stayed there. A lot of different generals had stayed there during the during the Civil War and all this other stuff was it was a hospital? I think at one point in the hotel at once.	
1	Yeah and and Cults over here going.	
3	Oh nothing's ever happened. I say we can explain everything. It was the same feeling I had when I told you the story about my dad's house at one time. It was that	
1	but worse, I'm just feeling like something's around you and yeah, I felt that way in there's a church out in with full Virginia that's like called like the church in the hill or the cave on the hill or something or that but it's like this old church and it functioned like it functioned as a civil war hospital and you can open up a closet and there's still blood stains from the Civil War if they cause what we're hospital if	
3	Nothing is said to have previously been anything actually just in general related to the Center for civil war. Right? I 100% will guarantee at on it. Yes. No, like no doubt like it.	
1	Yeah, there's no way not to be it's like upon this. It's like it's up on this hill it's in this Alcove. It's nasty business. Well this weekend I went and followed your recommendation and went to the Huntington art museum you did. I did Android I found it. Very delightful. It's like it's hidden away up there.	
3	Yeah told you you'll feel like you're just going to know where you have to drive through roads.	
1	I'm very familiar with but for Huntington that's pretty pretty settled. You're going like way our way up there but it's it's in a I guess a square with a little like open area in it and saw a lot of great art. It was really nice to had like Highschool exhibit a middle school exhibit. That was that Let's play obviously like more famous stuff. They had this really interesting like woven artwork that was there and a I guess it was an art display but it was historic guns. So black-powder rifle black-powder rifles. So you go. Yeah and a hand Cannon, which I thought was interesting which is literally Knights would take this thing. Thing that looked like a it looks like a small cannon that had been strapped to this piece of wood that the trigger was on top. So it was like more like a stick. Yeah with the cannon piece and they would fill it with like gunpowder I guess which is what you would I guess. I don't know much about how cannons work. Yeah meilin. Tell me what's wrong. It's Gotta Be It's gotta be some expired out there somewhere somewhere but nights would get on the back of the horse and they would have it. They just have one. Not during battle and they would fire their hand Cannon knows like that's what we need to call it.	
3	Something six this the it's like how you would get like one Grenade on Modern Warfare online.	
1	It's like hey would get there one that you there one shot at the beginning of the battle. So I went to I went there I try to go to the bowling alley over there and bowling alley not open Colonial Lanes not open that were was colonial. It was something out near that and and this is a hot take out near that terrible donut shop. Op called the Jolly dude.	
3	If you don't even talk trash about Jolly pirate, that's Jolly pirate is amazing.	
1	I know it's a hot take mmm.	
3	Also, you tried to go to Strike Zone the strike zone. Yeah that that place is the other bowling alley that's on Route 60.	
1	Yeah, we tried to go there is closed Jolly Jolly pirate or whatever is why would you serve now hear me out listeners will agree. Would you trust a donut shop that serves donuts and Euros? You don't know why they sell euros. How do they sell their own by a Greek family? Well, that's fine. I got then tick Greek that what I'm gonna go start a taco shop and I'm going to serve fish and chips too.	
3	They are you going to trust both of those things that that's the only Jolly pirate that does it the Jolly pirate in Ashland. Kentucky does not sell Euros. They just sell Donuts. I would trust that Jolly pirate more the both are owned by the same family.	
1	Well, I've had Donuts from the Jolly pirate and I thought that's fine. I could get better. Listen hot take get better ones at Krispy Kreme. Oh you shut. Your mouth. Yeah, I can get better ones.	
3	Oh, that's you're reaching like blasphemy levels right now.	
1	Have you read Carol?	
3	Even to Blacksburg a few times? I've never have you need to go. I bet it's trash. Yeah, I see how it feels when somebody bashes things you love.	
1	Well, you haven't tried it. So you don't know I however have tried it because I'm a worldly man a man of many travels, but I did eat at a fantastic restaurant to get on a more positive note called bahnhof Bonhoeffer, which I had never been to. Which is it was described to me as a German restaurant and I was like, okay, it's German Fusion food though. And I had this thing called it's so it's like you get sausages you can get schnitzel you can get nettle you can get all kinds of different German flavors, but they're all mixed with other types of food. So I had a currywurst which was a sausage made out to taste like Indian based Curry that It had like pistachios on top with dates and it was delicious.	
3	I think last time I was there I had a gyro but it was with sausage and it was pretty good.	
1	And then Selena got it was a schnitzel but it wasn't it was like a specifically Appalachians schnitzel.	
3	It was tasty and it be tasty.	
1	Yeah, it was it was real tasty. So if you're like that restaurant is one of the few places that is right now my favorite Shot I've eaten it there twice.	
3	I've been there one time it's so funny because you know, I spend a lot of time in Huntington, but I just never go there. It's a little pricey but it's really good.	
1	Well when you're Mushi mofo like me.	
3	Yeah.	
1	I say it's pricey and I'm sitting here drinking a little lady brought to look released to my house dog down cross lacrosse. And here we live down here in the city.	
3	Very comfortably gonna got my passion fruit Lacroix right? Hasn't it's my A restaurant. So right now I'm just want to just wanted to give them give them a quick shout-out for interesting interesting food in Appalachia.	
1	So if I ever go if you go to Camden parked only food Camden park and why did you do that?	
3	Why did you why did you go there in the first place?	
1	If you didn't have any kids probably just take a picture and be like I was there because once you get there, it's like a I don't know II can't talk hard. I can't talk hard can't part. Yeah can't talk about it. But with that, we've got a new inside the vault. Get into here we go into fought so many sex for those people. We had West Virginia food. We had borderline West Virginia go stores and now we're going to have some Western video game. How do you feel about that? Sounds good. So I'm just going to read it.	
3	I forgot they can't see me dude.	
1	No, they can't see you do your dance move? Whoa, you should see I saw him once break dance while talking to me and I was amazed at the sheer talent that this youngster has I've been truly amazed. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do you gotta perform. So I'm just going to read read this off because I actually thought that the narrative was Interesting rather than trying to summarize it. I'm not going to read the full thing. But I'm going to read the stuff about ever upwards.	
3	Let's do it.	
1	So this is in regards to the new patch or I guess part of wild Appalachia season in a quest called ever upwards or a series of quest. So the Intrepid Pioneers Scouts have a long history of inspiring the children of Appalachia to strive ever upwards ever upwards put a trademark on the on Missions of self-improvement and the betterment of their communities however lack of interested children in the wake of the Great War has caused active Scout numbers to dwindle hoo hoo. Ha ha the Pioneer Scouts are taking their philosophy of inclusivity to a whole new level by accepting recruits of all ages as a novice tadpole. You will need to prove you've embraced the Pioneer Scout Lifestyle by completing activities to demonstrate their core values kindness. Hopefulness bravery and growth you can also earn badges that show your Mastery over traditional activities like swimming archery cooking Athletics and More in addition to measuring individual growth badges will come in handy at the Pioneer Scout vending machines trade your badges in four themed loot that you can use to enhance your camp and show off your pioneering Spirit. Once you've been promoted to the rank of Mighty possum. I enjoy highly you will be able to pursue tougher badges that will reward you with your first backpack listening in this is about a an event that happens and I'll talk more about that. But listening to spooky stories around the glow of a campfire as a time-honored Pioneer Scout tradition had to Camp Adams after Nightfall to hear about the Terrors of the dark. Listen closely But be sure to look over your shoulder for any real creepy. Here's that may be lurking in the shadows. Don't worry too much. The story was originally told to more age-appropriate tadpoles and possums so will be too scary for our most veteran most veteran of the wasteland about to get Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts up in here.	
3	Yeah. Well and I like very well with the theme of what's going on in West Virginia this year. That's true. We do have this year now the world Boy Scout Jamboree	
1	Well such as this year, it's every year. We have the world that we don't just this year.	
3	We have Scout Jamboree, which is like a national thing but the world jamborees here this year. So we have people from all over the world coming.	
1	Oh, you're right. We can't because it's big it's a big deal every other year.	
3	But this year it's like a big deal.	
1	There's some insight is some insight at work have been preparing. Do you guys have to deal with this to we I can't I can't talk about what we have to do. We have to do things you guys are so for this we are associated.	
3	Well, it's cool though. It's going to be cool. I think there's going to be roughly 50,000 people there. Yes, which will make it like at that point like the biggest city in West Virginia for like a solid what two or three weeks. I think it explains but it'll be cool. So that's it's kind of neat that they're doing the Boy Scout thing and we've got this Big Boy Scout event and it's a big deal. Oh, yeah, definitely.	
1	It's it's an incredible challenge to have the infrastructure ready to go for that amount of people in this kind of remote area, even though it's used every year for the national. It's every year the national Jamboree happens at that location. It's been that way for years and years and years, but the having the world one there has happened before it's gone on there before he was A little maybe like eight or nine years ago that it happened is a big deal that's happening there again this year, but the Pioneer Scouts are boys and girls if you look at the posters in the game, it shows boys and girls so it seems like inclusivity is a big thing with them. Another thing that I thought was funny that people were reacting to was their values and how you dimmick are going to demonstrate kindness helpfulness of bravery and and growth in Fallout 76 because generally whenever they have like those whenever you have some sort of Ideal that you're trying to represent it's generally a pretty warped definition of what that is. So I'm curious how that we're going to do some kindness helpfulness bravery and growth. I'm excited for badges. I'm curious how this will work other than vending machines because I would want to like put them put them on my backpack. Yeah. You know what? Is one of the things that they're adding with this they're giving us backpacks. You can read more about that, which is something that is pretty cool makes sense for this game. One of the things you can add in like technology quote unquote. It's not like you're some sort of like cyber hacker in you're going to hack a doodle doo into your back doodle dude your it's I think it's mostly extra storage extra armor or a refrigerator you can like Small refrigerator you can put there. So the items can keep longer there.	
3	You have a look at that.	
1	I'm curious of this Camp items are curious how you're gonna display your badges because like I want to walk around with my badges. That was the whole thing. Yo your it. Did you did Boy Scouts briefly briefly.	
3	I was wasn't my scene man.	
1	I see I didn't I was never an eagle scout I went from I think I you start as a tiger then you go to a wolf Then you go to there's there's a there's a third one and then you hit up. We blow made all the way we blow nerd.	
3	I'm just kidding. Well, I'm just kidding. That's just a joke.	
1	These are just some jokey jokes man, you know, well, you know, at least at least I didn't work behind the counter at Food City, so I didn't work behind the counter Food City.	
3	So who's the joke on now now you talk about old Nick Thompson.	
1	Oh, that's true because you were busy stocking the shelves. I didn't do that either. You're over to dog. What are you? What did you do?	
3	What I had the prestigious opportunity of being a bag boy in high school. So sorry.	
1	I don't want to hear only had to go get this carts in the winter their buggies. Oh, oh, excuse me, uh Embrace debate. I do. I do Embrace that debate, huh? So I'm excited for what this is. Oh and the event so there was a data mine the kind of a little Of this event and it seems like that. There's there's this narrative that they put up but it seems like the disadvantage is going to be special in a way that it's not just like hey go kill this thing. Yeah, it's gonna be a little more abstract. It seems like it seems like that. There's a little bit like from the data. Mine is it led us to believe that there's a little bit of like a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing of like, how do you want the story to go? Go will monster come will it like some of those elements within it? So I'm excited about that. There's a lot of stuff to be excited for especially I think it's in May they've got backpacks have got the Pioneer Scouts come in. They've got your legendary vendors all your legendary items are getting changed over. They've got the new dungeon arctos Pharmacy. That's gonna be good time.	
3	I've got a picture of all the backpacks here are the viewers.	
1	Yeah, let me show them real quick. Look at this. See all this. Wow. Wow driving your cars. You thinking about the backpacks in your head. You haven't looked at it go. Look at the latest inside the Vault check these out. A lot of people are talking about some of the different faction themed ones the more Wasteland themed ones and then the baby Mothman is a favorite but I like the sloth one where you have like, it's like a little baby stuff sloth attached to your back. It's like it Disney World. Where you have all the kids walking around that have the dinosaur backpacks that have the leash attached to them and that's what I wanted to be is is akin to one of those rights like a little baby sloth walk around with me. Let's see what else do I have? So this week was actually probably the conclusion for Sheepsquatch and the game finally the Sheepsquatch revealed himself. To the masses through an event called free range in which you got a shepherd's Crook and you had to herd cows from one portion of the map to the other while defending it from different monsters inning in a Sheepsquatch as well as Random Encounters with the Sheepsquatch the Sheepsquatch. I have played both of those of course, and there's some crafting items that you get like you can craft your shepherd's crook with like Barbed. Wire or different stuff you can get a Sheepsquatch club that has a Sheepsquatch like skull on it or you can make these like throwing knives Tomahawk things that are from quills of the Sheepsquatch. But as far as introducing a Cryptid like taking it from the beginning of April to now and they'll all the quests and all the things they've done every week. It's really been a fantastic job where they have started with. This main quest of lying low of going through and in understanding that and getting the the I guess the meat of that understanding that storyline and then leaving it up to say well the Sheepsquatch us out there and putting it in the game as at some locations. You can hear something in the woods like you can hear the Sheepsquatch go off. It's like it's like and whenever the three ranges on the map, they don't give you a notification. In the game, you can hear it. If you're not listening to radio anything, you can hear the Sheepsquatch call and that lets you know that the event is happening and it's not that loud. It's like you have to be you have to be out in the forest. You have to be like somewhere quiet you can hear like it. So I think that's pretty cool. I want them to I want them to continue with this. This is cool. This is what I wanted them to do is continually like Like I did in this content people love Cryptids. That's we love Cryptid so much that's now 30% of our show. We really talked about crimson's today. It's going to be 60% spoiler alert. But if you read the title this you probably already know.	
3	I'm excited speaking of Cryptids real quick. Did you see today that some people on I think in the Himalayas may be found some very suspicious footprints that look like what they believed to be a Yeti.	
1	I did not it was in like the news new you sharing this outside of the cryptic Club corner. I'll have you know, you you have you have gone you have gone beyond we're talking Cryptids the whole episode.	
3	It's okay.	
1	This is the one episode the one episode where it's fine.	
3	We've already started so they saw the Prince Henry like whatever Army is stationed where they found them was out just doing a run I think and found these footprints that they said were not of any animal that they know that is native. to that area like giant like man like man animal like Footprints so Was it the Sheep squash was that the Sasquatch what what level of Squatch was a Squatch in them Woods demo, it would be the snow so well in them Hills the mountains right? It's used to mountains. Yeah, so I don't know it was on the news today though.	
1	I definitely saw it on I think it would be a cool environment have in fall is like a snowy environment. I wish they would do seasonal like in the winter.	
3	You get some snow in the forest by wish parts like I wish It had like half of the Savage divide was snow kind of like Red Dead you go up north right gets.	
1	Yeah, that would be cool. I would be down for that. I'm with it maybe in the nuclear winter.	
3	I see the vision season.	
1	They have I see the vision for a winter winter winter is here, but on the last note the patch 9 which includes ever upwards which includes backpacks which includes whatever they feel like putting in hopefully. Player vending, that'll come I think in this update that's what they have it scheduled for. I don't know they like change their mind about when they're doing that will be coming all on May the 7th, May the 7th. So so close its first met it was 102 degrees when I ran into my car today because yeah, but that's just your in the sun.	
3	It's probably the 80s though.	
1	I said, it wasn't a 90s. I'd looked at the weather so nice at the airport sheesh. Yeah GE GE airport as we call in the I'm Wade airport. I hate summer GE GE not ready for summer.	
3	I hate summer so much summer. Here's terrible. I need the mountains back.	
1	We do. We let's just go move up. We'll just let's make camps will go up there living cabins. You don't seem that enthused about it.	
3	I'm actually very enthused about that. Just dreaming about how wonderful that would be.	
1	All right, well with that we'll move on to our next segment.	
2	Welcome back dear listeners. It's time once again to put aside all you think, you know all you believe to be true time to open your mind to the strange bizarre and sometimes terrifying world that exists in the shadows and fringes of our own where myth Legend and roma Are Made Real. Yes. It's time for more thrilling Tales from the West.	
1	What are you pumped for bummed about this? What are you pumped for? This is this whole section this whole section. Will this can this can be the time when we're talking about this? I like that intro. Let's do it. Okay, it's already gone already here. We're going we're here. We're here hot mic we're talking about it. What are we talking about?	
3	We are talking. About wendigos wendigos.	
1	Our old our old pals are our wendigos our friends from the hills that are not pronounced when dingoes when Dango HL baby oven Dango wendigo a windigo, which I had somebody write in I think it tweeted us way back way back. Let's do a rewind And that was the day I I'm I'm very well aware what the rewind was? Okay. I'm up to date with the time Trapper. There's so much time travel going on. I don't know what's happened.	
3	We bring it back up. Now.	
1	I'm not bringing it back up.	
3	But that was as coming back to looking back to present. Okay, we're back to president.	
1	We're talking about wendigos. Now. If you don't know what it windigo is there in Fallout 76 imagine that this is the final Cryptid we've yet to talk about this in the game. We've done episodes on flight. Monster grabbed a monster Moth Man Sally gasping.	
3	I'm trying to think of the other Cryptids that are done quite a few but the windigo has eluded us the windigo has long eluded us.	
1	It's and Julie are we talk about the wind to go on really the first true day of summer? Yes or is so hot. We're here. We're here. We're right here.	
3	We're talking about it.	
1	It's happening to so as the tail goes. The windigo was a lost Hunter during a brutally cold winter his intense hunger drove him to cannibalism after feasting on human flesh. He became a crazed monster roaming the forest in search of more people to eat. It's not a good look. It's not a good look. So that's the the simplified. Yes.	
3	I suppose version of feel like it's just a its. What do you think about it? He really the windigo really is like the creepiest to me. Like it's very disturbing.	
1	It serves a think it serves the cultural purpose. Yeah as well. I mean it's very rooted in like old folklore from what goes back to on Algonquin lure of and now the on Quints were primarily in Canada in that area, right? They were oh my gosh. I will well transparency the transparency. We do a lot of editing. We're not perfect. We do a lot of editing This is highly edited. We the Algonquin so I don't know what I've talked about. We like I'm an Algonquin are primarily in Canada and they essentially created this, you know, and I can't get into the head of what the Algonquin were thinking but with most myths and and stories and stuff there, too. I guess generate a law or have some sort of moral lesson to teach the windigo is primarily a story told in Algonquin tribes about this spirit that possesses you to eat human flesh. And once you start eating human flesh, you can't stop just pop fun. Don't stop right and it only happens when you're cold and greedy. So essentially it was saying hey when you go out to hunt and it gets really cold in the winter you Eat other people. Yeah, don't do that or else your turn into a windigo.	
3	Well, that's one way to keep people from doing it.	
1	Right. You don't want to be a win to go. Nobody wants to be windigo like being it being the loser, but I don't know because then when it goes back then were described as like SuperDuper lanky and larger larger than a normal human. Yeah and very gray pale skin with bunny teeth and antlers. Yeah, which are not present in and fought 76 is	
3	Right version of the windigo she different versions. But yeah, so it was basically a way to deter people from from being cannibals essentially, right? It's kind of like how my mom used to tell me if you keep doing that with your face. It's going to get stuck that way. Yeah, it's just Algonquin version of that right a little more brutal.	
1	If you don't eat your vegetables, how you going to grow hair and chest if you sit too close to the TV your eye your vision is going to be bad, right?	
3	There's other ones, but I won't So yeah, so there's a lot of I'm actually glad you said that because I was about to say it but you know, there's there's a lot of those but yeah, so it's sort of just like this cautionary tale that would keep children up at night, right? Yeah. I mean, it's a good method when you think about it cuz I mean even now I'm a little scared.	
1	Yeah, there's two different there's two different theories of thought with windigos of where they draw their power because they're very fast. Every incarnation of wendigos are very fast, right? They have a lot of strength as well.	
3	But that's my question is where we're like, where's that strength coming from because their arms are like the size of my pinky, right?	
1	And and and that's theory of where they draw their Our so ancient lore would say this Algonquin Lord would say that it would be a demon that would possess them to eat the flesh when they are feeling greasy mess with demons reading cult. And so then the spirit of the the windigo would be inside you you would become a wendigo at that point. The other theory is that when you ingest and a lot of human flesh. Yes that you gain Supernatural. Power and then become like because you have ingested in the forbid The Forbidden meat. Yeah, you you gain these powers to become a wendigo. So it's not by a spirit. It's by the supernatural nutritional value of human flesh. Well old are many calories were talking. Yeah. Wonder what I wonder what the caloric intake sodium.	
3	I need to know like the nutrition right the nutritional values this	
1	Organic grass-fed. Yeah, well if there's they then you know, we got to hear both sides of the story. We do so not condoning cannibalism. Let me just say that no no and we've talked about cannibalism on this podcast before has just actually we've done this before. In fact, we've done it all with drugs and alcohol involved as well. Yes, and it's all been wrapped up into one and two into my character and fall outside. 86 but I think that you were the origins of the windigo are interesting, but I think what's more interesting is its pervasiveness in pop culture, which was something that I was particularly. Interested in reading and seeing you had stories of hunters from the 1800's that were out and doing stuff and hunting and went to put cold Lodge and then the the windigo is there like all surprise surprise, but I think modern and can't like incarnations of it are interesting. So for example, Stephen King has had a big influence on what I guess. A modern version of a wendi-go is he wrote particularly two books that are their famous one that I don't know much about which is called The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, which was about a wind this girl who is hunted while she's on the Appalachian Trail in Maine or Massachusetts or Appalachian Trail is not Massachusetts. Probably in lower Maine Vermont. I don't know one of the state's she's somewhere she is. Blind, but she's on the Appalachian Trail and a win to goes hunting her which is the inspiration. If you look for the artwork that is like the tales of the West Virginia heels artwork where they have the windigo episode you'd see the face of the wind to go and fall at 76 but in his eye you can see a boy that is almost a direct copy of the girl from the cover of that book.	
3	Fun fact timely. Fun fact about the Appalachian Trail the trailhead Ours are in Harpers Ferry.	
1	Let's chew some would call that the midpoint of that blood trail. So it started in that and then in Pet Cemetery, which is had two movies now is very famous book. All of this happenings are from a spiritual windigo that possesses. Not only these things to come back to life of spoiler alert animals come back to life and spoiler alert it. It it makes everybody get real angry and greedy and want to like it influences them to behave erratically. So truck drivers that drive through there, which is like a I guess off the beaten truck truck passage and in both the books in the movie Speed heavily through there and that causes some some frightening things for the family of and I do that here in the neighborhood of when I see people passing by I'm Shake your fist. Yes, I in my head a man thought about getting a clothesline out and then you know as as the motorcyclist at 2:00 a.m. Come screeching to the neighborhood. They are they wake me up every time.	
3	Yeah, I've heard him to they go down my road like crazy. But so if I'm I've never seen or read pet cemetery, but from what I understand, it's Basically, these people are brought back to life. Right but they're not them. They're not themselves.	
1	No, they're not themselves are very like with the word mole of Mel violent.	
3	there's a dog fight going on upstairs very just like aggressive and evil and	
1	just kind of just very off right there there tinged more towards the evil spectrum.	
3	That is we think of when I was in school. I remember we read like a short story like the monkey paw a monkey's paw or something like that. It sounds familiar. It was basically the the family something along the lines of they were granted A Wish by this monkey's paw and their son I believe had died. In the war and they wish that he would come back but they but they were told that he would not be the same and that he would be you know bad and it wouldn't be their son and all this stuff right? I think that I think the story ends with they did wish for it and then they just hear this like clawing on the front door like it right after it and then that it's over that kind of makes me think of that like a yeah.	
1	Yeah, the the spiritualness of it has been I guess covered in in a bunch of different Realms like the game until dawn if you haven't played that you should it's probably one of the best like not necessarily point-and-click. It's like a Choose Your Own Adventure Style game with Hayden Panettiere and the guy from Mr. Robot and the queen movie. I forgot Rami. Oh, you're talking about yeah the plays he's got real big big eyes. Yeah big guy. I got creepy. Yeah, man, he's in it. This is a got like this like weird star-studded cast Hayden Panettiere. So yeah from heroes in the show Nashville, you know, she was still doing it. Yeah. She was in the video game. It's really good. It is a perfect. Like teens go to a cabin in the winter and Mischief occurs, and there's twists and turns but a portion of that game is the legend of wendigos. And in that one. It's more of a spiritual element to it. You should go play that game. I don't want to spoil too much about that game because half of that game is story. Yeah, don't give it away. I don't want to give it away. But that's another representation of spiritual when it gets tough. The thing that I think is more interesting. Interesting is the belief that consuming human flesh gives you Supernatural Powers Yeah.	
3	It's like they on one end. They tell you that you'll turn into this horrific creature, but then on the other end there like you'll turn into this creature because eating human flesh gives you super powers. So it's like, you know, there's some people out there that are like like way in the office super powers, like maybe they shouldn't include that that your I get super powers, right and that be like know you'll turn into this horrific being that's all you need to say.	
1	So there's a line that's drawn there between skinwalkers. Yes.	
3	And when that goes are you familiar skin wives like vaguely like I've definitely heard of them and of that folklore, but right could probably both of these these being yeah that	
1	Infiltrate that look like your friends that stalk groups that paranoid people that change their face to look like this or that and then plot the demise of these essentially Slenderman are they associated with like fairies and like Irish or maybe Scottish cultures? I think so, I think you're right. I think you're right.	
3	They thought that they weren't really the person that they were portraying essentially and I think a lot of people were Like executed because of that because they thought that they really weren't. Yeah, there was there was a story I read about that and a lot of times if people would not act like themselves and maybe they'd have a really bad fever and be really sick, right it was as if you know, they were there they were infiltrated and it was like a demon demonic thing and I think I'm wanting to say maybe it was Irish either Ireland or Scotland one of the two it was really big thing back way back. Back in the day that they thought people were basically had been possessed. Right?	
1	So it's kind of yeah, they it seems like in folklore they seem to look similar under scribes similarly, but but they can tell the difference is at the human flesh. Yeah, the the consumption of human flesh. So Wendigos the horns of a wendigo. So typically it's portrayed and has been portrayed in folklore as having a skull ish face with akin to deer antlers on their head. And and so one thing I didn't realize one of my favorite shows on NBC the probably there will never be another show like that. NBC will never allow another show like this on there called Hannibal. Have you heard of Hannibal watched Hannibal? Anibal is the story of Will Graham who is a crime-scene expert who gains I guess knowledge about crime scenes via being extremely empathic and so can really get into the mind of the murderer gets together with the lead FBI agent. Who is a forgot	
3	I had his name.	
1	He's Morpheus in The Matrix. Very famous.	
3	Actor. Oh Lawrence Lawrence Fishburne.	
1	Yes gets with him. And he realizes that maybe this will character is 2 into what's happening in these different murders and so hires a therapist to take care of him. The therapist is a therapist by the name of Hannibal Lecter who is played by Mads Mikkelsen who goes on I think the show last three seasons. It's one of the most fantastic shows on television. It's beautiful its artistic will obviously if you don't know and I'm not going to spoil the show Hannibal Lecter is a cannibal. Yes Hannibal the cannibal that is when you think of cannibalism you think of Hannibal Lecter. Oh, yeah, and I think of Anthony Hopkins like right in my this is a hot take method. Mickelson does a better job with really hand he because he's not in jail. He's still out in the world practicing and hiding stuff and is kind of an antihero is on people for this category. It's all relative to its supposed to be before the books. Like the they have what Anthony Hopkins Petraeus or from a series of books about Hannibal Lecter who's a fictional character not obviously not a historical character. But supposed to be a prequel to this and so he helps will but also will is so empathetic towards murderers and can get in their heads when his therapist is a murderer it gets in his head. Mmm, and there's some trickery and some different stuff happening with who's consuming what human flesh There's a lot of different dream sequences. Where will is obviously haunted by these killers and murderers and he's always portrayed as a stag in the in the dreams Hannibal Lecter is always portrayed by an elongated black like like dark black skin character with white eyes and deer antlers. Hmm, so he's he is the windigo and Believes below like in this is relative knowledge believes that he achieves higher power by consuming human flesh that it is like the delicacy to have so Hannibal Lecter is a windigo. It all makes sense. It all makes sense. Now it seriously if you want to see that visualization or just watch a really good show about out but crazy Psychopathic Killers. It's one of the best. I'm surprised NBC actually actually did it because there's some gruesome stuff through some stuff. I mean not not good. There is there is one point in the show where they are investigating a killer that is trying to turn their victims into angels in which he peels the back skin off of them to form angel wings. That's pretty gross and they show all of it and it's a prime-time NBC. Well, apparently they're trying to do with season 4. But right now the Show creator is working on American Gods, but they want to do a season for because they didn't finish the story line, huh?	
3	So I did some thinking you just don't think it goes and I was thinking what like where have I seen this before right. I knew there was something from my life that I remember a story or something. I had heard or seen and I was like this just it looks familiar. It sounds familiar. Huh? And you know who this brought me back to who'd the spring back to Dixie my grandmother?	
1	Oh, here we go. Okay.	
3	So when I was with the counter up when I was a kid, I don't know if I've ever mentioned this on this show, but when I was a kid Dixie, I will I will refer to her as Nana that's what I always call it Manna all of us grandkids. Call her Nana. Yeah, so when I was a kid when my cousins I were all kids because I'm the oldest of the cousins right but we're all within just a couple years of each other Nana used to tell us a lot of different stories before bed or we were little a lot of them were like Brer Rabbit or these old classic, you know kids tales that were nice, but sometimes nana got a little fill a little Saucy with story. She wanted to switch it up a little bit. Right and that was when we first heard the tales of bloody bones.	
1	The ever heard of Bloody Bones, you hadn't mentioned bloody bones in passing this podcast.	
3	So we're going to get into Bloody Bones. I want to hear about Billy Bones more. I thought about it. I started looking and Oh They'll bloody bone stories. Hmm, and I think it fits pretty well. Okay, I'm gonna tell you I want to tell it's a very short story. I want to tell you one of the stories that nannies.	
1	Yeah me before I want to hear them going to tell her just the way she would tell it if Reggie fils-aime was here. He would say my body. Ready?	
3	So so just put yourself in let's say like six maybe seven year old Austin's shoes Okay. So just imagine that you're you're at your grandmother's house. Hmm and my nana lived in McDowell County, which is down near where Welch is and Welch as you know in the game is in the in a very it's down in the mountains. It's kind of away from everything. Yeah. We like to call it McDowell County McDowell County. Yeah, and it's down in the holler. Too much your you the mountains are the clothes in pretty tight on where she lived which was Yeager.	
1	I think we actually have a listener in McDowell County.	
3	I'm saying that right now well, so she lived in Yeager and Yeager was just this little town not a whole lot of people maybe 100 maybe 200 people at the time. Live right by the creek, but the mountains were on each side of the house pretty much, you know the go up in the hills. There's a little creepy spot at night if you're out there, so I'd be laying there and I tell her to tell me a story and this was the story. She said she said once there's a little boy named Austin and he came to his grandmother's house. So she said in this up and I'm shook. Yeah, you're already wrong.	
1	He's like right now - yeah.	
3	I'm at my grandmother's house. Right? I'm like, okay, so she says Austin, Ask his grandmother one day if they could bake some cookies. She said we can but I need you to go to the basement and get some of the ingredients for me. I need to go get me some eggs from the basement. Hmm. Austin didn't want to go to the basement. He was scared to go to the basement because the basement was dark and scary. She said well Austin if you don't go get those eggs, I'm going to make you go up and you got to go to bed right now. You can't stay up anymore today. You got to go on to bed that And so awesome was like well, I don't want to go to bed. I want these cookies. So he walked down the stairs into the dark cold basement. And he immediately came running back up. He said Nana. I saw two glowing eyes in the corner of the basement staring at me. She said that's dumb get back down there. There's nothing there go get the eggs or you're going upstairs. So you went back down the steps. He got a little bit further into the basement this time. Then he saw those glowing eyes in the corner again, and he heard this creaking noise and he ran back up the steps and he said I can't get him. There's something down there. His grandmother had gotten very frustrated at this point and send him upstairs to go to bed. Well, he woke up in the middle of the night because he thought he heard a noise hmm. He's upstairs and he thought he heard something and then he started trying to go back to sleep and he heard. I don't know if that'll register.	
1	All right, it'll registered Austin.	
3	I'm on the first step.	
2	Austin	
3	I'm on the fifth step. And so she would build this up. Mmm, you know, just come on the ninth step. And she would just keep going and she gets slower and slower as she's just making the noise and then it was you know, I'm I'm I'm laying in bed just just terrified as she's telling the story right Austin. I got you and she like grabbed me and like shake me real quick and I would every time I would hear the story so many times and then she started telling more that was the first story of Bloody Bones I ever heard she referred to it as the story of Bloody Bones getting me and she kept telling these other stories though and it became this thing of the character and Always me or my cousins names as the characters we go and up into the mountain and Yeager and we'd find a cave and there were all these bones on the ground and we got scared and as we tried to leave we saw this the skeleton looking creature dripping in blood just like just you know, just I mean it had skin but it was the scale of the skeleton basically and it would and it was it would eat kids would eat people and it would it chased us out of the cave back down the hill and tried to kill us. And looking back now. I realized why I have so many issues now because I mean my cousins and I have genuinely discussed.	
1	This is the why we all have is yeah because the Old Dixie wanted to tell us these stories story of Bloody Bloom, but I never thought about it.	
3	And then now that we started thinking about wendigos. I was like, wait a second this bloody bone sounds an awful lot like a win to go right and and it's so how was it my question?	
1	How was it going into the windigo cave? In pots only six.	
3	Luckily I didn't think about it. But now I need to go back I think and try it again because that sounds like literally exactly well. I did some research and I looked up bloody bones because I was I didn't know if it was something that she had just right bent. I didn't know how big of and it's a it's an old folklore story that I didn't realize it's been passed down through different cultures and all this stuff and there was a story I read about this. This woman said that her great-grandfather had In a coal miner back in the early nineteen hundreds in the sand the American southwest and that they sent them up to blast this hole in the side of the mountain and they were going to send someone down to see if they could get finding see any coal or anything and they blasted it and they tied this guy up and I'm assuming early 1900's there wasn't a lot of Technology the way there is no sir. It was very dangerous to do this. And apparently they lowered this little guy into the hole with a flashlight and he was gonna looking on the on the on the side of the mountain there and they kept going and going and going he just kept going down down down down down and then all of a sudden they heard him scream and the Rope got real tight and he was going pull me up pull me up and they're trying to pull the Rope but they just can't so they get everybody start pulling that rope and all of a sudden they just all go flying back because just the slack just let right off on the rope and they pull it up and there's just blood covering the bottom of the rope and a pair and they said that a flat they Shine the Light down and as they did they could see this creature crawling up the walls of the hole and it was just this skeleton looking being with horns and red eyes and the sharp teeth coming up out of the side of the mountain and that they all got in the truck and drove off now obviously, I don't know how valid the story is, but it sounds like bloody boat sounds like bloody borrow Indigo and	
1	and it's it seems that these think I think Bloody Bones and windigo might are might be very similar. If not the same thing.	
3	I think it comes from the same type of just basis like this. Just this being that is going to eat you or eat children. Yeah, and it's just the thing that will keep you up in a windigo a chill baby. I mean it really is creepy. And now the more I've thought about Bloody Bones, I'm like, wow, I really like wait a second.	
1	Seems like you're connected up exactly.	
3	So what dig it that's my big contribution to the old windigo thing.	
1	You'll win the go thing. I've Got a Theory. This is what all in the Sun. So in Fault 76 we have these we have the cult of the Mothman. Obviously, it's related to Mothman and somehow we find it underneath the Mothman Museum, but all of the masks are a skeletal face with horns with bonus. - like the Garb that comes with the dislike bonus armor. Yeah, and then all of their statues are very reminiscent of the statues and Idols in Pet Sematary related to the windigo. So my theory is that the Mothman cultist are eating some people I think that that is a part of it that they are are trying to be windigos as well. That's by my theory along with of course, you've got the Gourmand switches. Part of connected to the story of fall out where the thoughts of these six where you have this freighter group that is are cannibals and then their leaders go off because they've ate everybody and they go to a cave and turn into a wendigo because they have eaten everyone.	
3	Yeah.	
1	So a lot of things flying around other things flying around but that's what I see. I've been trying to put my finger on what that imagery is because the like skull face the horns. Does it read? Mr. This a lot of like like horns and skulls around that cult that aren't related to Mothman. Really there's some Mothman Idols like you can you can tell if you go to some of the churches like there's like these Mothman constructions, but a lot of these different areas, it's mostly horns and skulls which are reminiscent of the wind to goes from from Pet Sematary and then like thinking about Hannibal Lecter and thinking about all this stuff. The thing that I think would would be interesting. I've always thought that in in in Fallout, you can't have different races like you would in Skyrim, but because everybody has to start as a fresh dweller and so like from coming from Vault 76, I've always thought it'd be interesting if you could by means of radiation or some sort of Accident become a ghoul that your player could be or you undergo the Super Mutant stuff. And so like you would have positives like for ghouls you would be radiation were no harm you at all it would heal you but you would be extra prone to damage or something and something for super mutants, but I think windigos would be an interesting one of having cannibal perk and eating so many dead bodies that you would then become a windy go where Are you would have for example higher agility, but lower strength something like that.	
3	I like it.	
1	That's my that's my proof of of here's how we get races into that. But then if we if you do that only your new players are going to be Vault dwellers. Everybody else is gonna be Riley's gonna be cool isn't super mutants and when daggers which hey man fun, though. I'm cool with grow under some. How do you become Mothman you just go to the lamps. All right, Austin, so this week we got some mail here that I wanted to talk to you about. But before we get to that, I've got a Cryptid Club update so last week I introduced the cryptic club which includes Cryptids internationally and I had a kindly sir Michael yo send me an article of five Cryptids from Illinois, which is which is where he's at. It's Illinois. Yeah, it's, Illinois. And I wanted to talk about one of them in the 1940s a leaping simionescu. Oddity was spotted in the small town of Mount Vernon in the 1970s a similar Beast now with three legs and eyes as bright as flashlights with seen several times in nearby infield, Illinois by a young boy and his neighbor on the same night then later by a local radio news. Anchor some say it was an escape chemistry. Experiment some say it was alien Loren Coleman founder of the international cryptozoology Museum in Maine, which I want to go to and a central Illinois native investigated the time and said it made quite a stir and not so much now some sod some saw a deformed kangaroo and thought it was a very or Lauren thought it was a variation of an ape so it's nice to be confused this infield. Field or infield monster is that to be confused with the infield Poltergeist, which is from the same town.	
3	They got a lot of stuff going on. Which the infield Porter Geiss is.	
1	What the 2016 film Conjuring 2 is based on. Yeah, they definitely have a lot of things got some stuff going on in field. So Henry McDaniel was the first person to encounter it in 1973 and his quote of what it looked like was it Three legs on it a short body to little short arms and two pink eyes as bright as flashlights. It's stood at four and a half feet tall and was grayish tan colored. He said if they do find it, they will find more than one and they won't be from this planet. I can tell you that quote as a hot take it's hot take he knows.	
3	He's straight up calling it right off the bat not from this planet.	
1	Yep, he's got it. So these investing cool though. He's investigators came out. And they were interviewing your by residents and they were told that Greg Garrett a 10 year old neighbor of McDaniel. Who's the neighborhood boy claimed to have encountered the creature half an hour before McDaniel did said that the creature had stepped on his feet tearing his tennis shoes to shreds. Well, but it didn't hurt him but it didn't hurt him. So it's just confused or you know, and I'm I'm going out on a limb here and say and maybe Greg Garrett tore up his shoes and maybe just want his mom to get bad said.	
3	Hey, yeah, if I did that my mom busts my you know, what, so maybe I'm with I'm with this is the infield monster it got him.	
1	It got him right then and there he likes saw an opportunity.	
3	Opportunity like I saw a to that's what happened to my shoes.	
1	Right? So that's me the skeptic within me be like a little Greggy Daniels, you know, he's fooling around. So on the note of skepticism in this topic, it was suggested that the creature may have been a kangaroo which I had mentioned escaped from a nearby Zoo which would explain the three legs description as the tail of the kangaroos can look at third leg McDaniel was adamant that the creature excuse me adamant that the creature Wasn't no kangaroo. That's a quote wasn't okay having owned such a creature as a pet while on military service in Australia Scott's like I owned it and doubting that kangaroos have narrow faces and tracks that leave claw marks.	
3	I tried to tell this guy was a kangaroo. He's like little did they know it was like the one guy in the state that opened a kangaroo kangaroo.	
1	Yeah, so following media coverage of the creature and Ohio man contacted loose local newspaper. Stating that the creature may have been his pet. Kangaroo may see which had been lost or stolen a year previous.	
3	Everybody. Haven't pet kangaroos man.	
1	I don't know. All I remember is my dad used to tell well, my dad's best friend used to tell the story about the sky and blue field who back in the 1960s had a pet Al pet alligator in his bathtub. And blue field when I think of Christ crazy pets stuff, I think about the alligator the bathtub now, it's in the sewer blue and his name is dr. Connors. That's a deal that's deep cut right there deep cut yeah deep cut so I want to thank Michael for sharing that if you have any Cryptid stories, you can send them in I'll probably do a little bit of research in the background and because we won't would have been able to have a conversation about kangaroos, which is always fun.	
3	Kangaroo song kangaroo.	
1	Crews from so right in the show you can do that through our Discord server, which is in the links as well as email. We want to hear more stories about the Cryptids that you have in your community or around the world or things that you're just interested maybe something Western Union. Maybe it's something in Illinois like Michael here. Maybe it's something in Hawaii. I want to know Hawaii encrypted. I want to challenge people to really get out there and figure out some stuff bring it to the Cryptid Club, but I appreciate Michael first contribution. Yes, Michael to the client you for your service. In male though. I've got a letter here not related cryptic Club. This is from John. I just wanted to write it to tell you all. What a great job. You're doing blending Fallout WV with the real life. WV was very creative move. They the Austin bring him in the show in a way few other podcasts have done. I've listened and re-listen to almost all of your casts. Keep up the good work John from Nova from those. He says PS you need to get Dixie on soon PSS. Should sponsor a vault boys event at the next Mothman Festival New River Bridge day, etc, etc.	
3	Fun fact, we actually wrote that email we were just trying to weave we were the email who you were. I'm John I'm John from Nova it's whatever.	
1	No but thank you John. Thank you for that. No was a that was a good little area. I spent a lot of time up there over the years a lot of friends the that it lived up there like a lot of people from Blue fo Virginia at some point lived in Nova. Yeah, and my friends in college were all from there. So I've run up near Manassas and Woodbridge and they'll call it who'd Bridge up there, which I thought was funny. It's a nice. Spot it is crowded easy is little. Yeah, one of the biggest are what I first time I first time I went up there I was like, oh I'll go I'll go to go up to Staunton Virginia and then cut over and get up Richmond in the go north from there and I hit that right at five o'clock and it was right outside Quantico, which is a military base and it was the most traffic I've ever seen in my life. And I thought is this how the world Works my little country mouse in my Honda Accord. It and I was like is it 95? I 95 yards got there and it was terrible. And yeah, I one time I spent two hours.	
3	I got stuck trying to get out of DC to get back over to Centreville one night and we left at like 5:30. It was like a 30 minute drive in to get back to Centre Ville was literally over to our yeah, it's a lot of traffic is impossible. The Metro is the way to go.	
1	Yes, it still sucks. But it's the waitress fine. That's just good like the Metro fine. I've seen takes it off on the Metro, but I have seen some stuff in the Metro as well. I swear I swear that I've seen an Obama impersonator on there like it was just Barack himself it. Hey, I wasn't but in my head I'm like that guy looks exactly like bra. That's what they did.	
3	And so he was either they made him like just look they made Obama just looks like mostly like himself. So people would be	
1	Like that'll botnets not Obama, but it looks like Obama it was either one of those and this is an Obama was President that it was either like a person that would work in Times Square that dress up as a character. It looks so real or it was like maybe he works as the body W. No, that's my my brain working there exactly my conspiracy theories of my Cryptids tacos, but thank you John. We want to do a vault boys event. I want to do something. You know do something sometime sometime. We should sometime when we have time which is practically never but I think maybe my I don't know Mothman Festival.	
3	Maybe I think that makes the most I think that makes the most be hard to do it Abridged a bridge day.	
1	There's so much going on Mothman Festival would be more Akin and we already know that we get a lot of thought fans coming to Mothman Festival clearly because 50% of the people that came to Mothman Festival last year were Fallout fans. So maybe something for that this year. I don't know. I will bring the umbrellas and the air conditioner units so that we won't die because it was hot tamale. They're also had some iTunes reviews.
