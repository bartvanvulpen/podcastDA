1	Yes, so just know get soaked. Yes. Welcome to the oh, yes podcast. We got our boy Mike listen day in the crib. We've known Mike for a very long time. Mike is a manager to the Stars. If you will to the Trap Gods the world made of the Trap God. There's artists like effing company Mike. Asante Incorporated, yeah, what's up, man? How's your day going?	
2	Pretty good. Just kind of in between, you know, Coachella dates. You're in LA in between.	
1	So yeah, so you were when we met you you were you were an artist actually. Yeah, right. So I think one thing that's interesting that you told me and like I like you like explain what you meant by it. But like you were doing the artist thing you guys were you had traction like when we met you guys had some good traction. You had a good Agent you releasing on the right labels, you had the good remixes, but you told me A one-day you like kind of looked at the project from a manager side and you were like, I don't know that I would sign myself. Hmm that was kind of the deciding factor for you to be like, I think I'm gonna like go into the business side of things and like stopping an artist because I don't know that I would sign myself and I found it. So interesting that you were able to look at it from an outside perspective like that because I don't think a lot of people could what did you like? What like struck that chord where you were like? Oh like I don't I don't know that I would sign my think.	
2	It's a it's a lot of is a lot of factors, but I think You know after you know, you know working on, you know, various radio shows and you know working, you know day job in it at like, you know, like record labels and stuff. I think it just came to a point to where I Knew Too Much maybe at the level. I was at not not like a like a horn tooting sort of thing, but it was just kind of like shit like I you know, I don't know, you know, I remember I had this moment where I kind of read. Realized what it took to become like a top career artist and I didn't enjoy producing music enough to like be stacking, you know, 10 ready always be sitting on like, you know, huge Bank of music. Yeah, right and you know, yeah, I think that's I mean, I love making music I you know, I like helping my guys out where they need it, you know for like Sonic notes and stuff, but you know stacking that much content all the time like you really gotta love it. Yeah you	
1	Really? I when I we met you it was clear that you and you you produce music and you were really good at producing music but you got more a kick out of the business side of music, you know, and I feel like like a lot of artists, you know, like I personally like the business side like I love making music but something about the business side of Music gets me fucking riled up. You know what I mean? Like I just like I just like it's an exciting Adventure sure compared to like making it was I like making it too but when it's done We get to start planning. That's like my favorite part.	
2	Yeah, you know, but you know, you're also the the face of a project that you know, a lot of people including yourself would sign as a manager, you know what I mean? So I was a you know, I just took a really realistic standpoint of the project I had and I was like shit, I don't know.	
1	Yeah, like that's it that that's a hard thing to do like kind of take yourself out of the situation by putting yourself on the out like looking into it. You know what I mean, which is it's crazy that you were able to do that. That good good. Yeah, very good advice for sure. You pick up time. Tynan's your first what you got Izzy. I remember is he is he had some traction we did a song with easy actually. Yeah, and he was going good and I feel like he I feel like he just didn't want to continue down this path or like what happened there.	
2	You know. I mean, I think a lot of it just comes down to like how much you need to be, you know, like really active on social media and stuff and there, you know in the beginning it's cool, but after a while, you know you It's really a full-time gig, you know, and so I don't know that's really kind of some people hate it and some people really don't like social media. I mean, he's a great producer like, you know, we still you know produce him for a lot of people, you know a good friend, but he's not, you know, like a full like a full-time client environment.	
1	So you pick up tying and tynan's like starts kind of pop in on this thing and then so you use that to like well this was so tight other artists or like how does it how do you grow your rosters was the beginning of the partnership?	
2	So tie in and started to make some moves you You know and then I start having conversations with company.	
1	Are you just finding these kids on like SoundCloud or like how like how do you find a company?	
2	I started hearing about company. He's one of those guys like, you know, he used to be one of those guys who play with like Bear Grylls all the time like, you know with Woolly and all those guys and you know, I heard that he didn't have management and you know, he was so like tightly wound with this like crew is like Woolly and all those guys. It wasn't really in anyone's face that he didn't have a manager right? So I Up and asked and he said he was available. So we had a conversation for a few months. Then I brought a never-say-die EP to the table after meeting with TJ over at the label in Amsterdam. And then man now he's like one of the main never said I gotta say shit is so good. He's great.	
1	So how do you like so with I feel like what bass music and honestly, I mean with house music too, I guess but with Bass music because it's not based so much on Melody. It's a little bit harder. I feel like to like listen to a company song or listen to it. Tynan song or listen to and know who you're listening to. So how do you approach like separating like a company from Bear Grylls? You don't need like obviously he's not wearing a bear mask.	
2	But like how let's that's the thing. So with Bass music a lot of it comes down to I mean right now because it is really saturated. It comes down to being you know, as loud as you can with your brand look at artists like sub Tronics sudden death peekaboo, you know all those guys, you know, they Have their own thing going on but it falls under that umbrella. They're all really loud in their own way. And I mean if you you know, if you were to go to you know companies story. He's you know, he's really loud to now, you know, he's got like silver hair and he's like off to the side all crazy and you know, he's like getting you know easy starting to you know, get you know, he's just on it. Yeah, he's getting more down with the culture and that's your as a manager from the outside.	
1	Are you like pushing them to do it? Are they doing on them better? Oh, so you're like you're like actively like hey. Find your own way to be crazy like yeah.	
2	Yeah. I had a meeting with with with Steve Gordon about it. You know, he obviously runs, you know the dance Department over it, you know UTA with a Gimbal and he was he was saying, you know, he made some notes a while ago, you know saying like hey, you know, I feel like you know company should you know, maybe a little louder and so, you know really ever since then we've really stayed on it. Yeah, you know, I've always been like on it but like, you know, I didn't really understand how loud he had to And now it's really Gordon gives you advice you like okay, we gotta really popped off one or two artists.	
1	Yeah, he's helped a couple guys in the industry. Where is the loudest guy on social media? You could ever had. He has a yellow fucking McLaren with what Smurf blue Rim so that guy knows about being lat.	
2	Yeah. So yeah, just that little bit of advice we've been running with and you know, it's really helped company keep his momentum going, you know, because it's all different moments that were fighting. It just keep growing, you know, one thing a lot.	
1	A lot of kids ask us that like I've noticed now as an artist is there like what was that moment? Right and you're like there isn't there isn't a moment. It's like a million moment. Yeah that make up your career. It's a show on ABC called a million little things there. It's not one thing. It's a million things but it really is you know what I mean? It's like you got to play this Festival. But all that means is that next year? Hopefully you did well enough to get a better slot. Yeah and a better slot and then maybe like there isn't like one declining thing. There's a couple Exceptions there.	
2	There's there's only really One thing that can be the one thing is if you have like a levels or like a humongous hit that like that's like the only thing you can really say is like that was it for me, but everything else is likely I was see that little Stepping Stones like okay. Yeah, but she'll on this this stage did you know EDC on the Art Car whatever the little things maybe like to keep going and going but even the big ones like, you know, like say A Levels or something like that's undeniable. But at the same time like you need a team the like keep that wave going but yeah because there have been you know big Big big hits in the past or you know, the teams are the artist or you know, one one weak Link in the chain didn't keep it going and that perfect storm per se wasn't so perfect.	
1	Yeah. We we know guys that had some of the biggest songs and dance music ever and like they can't get a show now, you know, I mean, it's like they just it just didn't kind of pan. So like moving forward like what do you like? What's the plan? What do you guys do to go from like being a direct support act who's like on the cusp to like know he's a full-fledged fuck. Headliner like you have to start saying no to shows. Are you pairing them? Like what's that? What's the move?	
2	A lot of it comes down to the power of pass obviously saying no to shows and then you know, it's really I'm starting to run into he's it's it because you know with direct versus, you know, say like lower than direct it comes down to just having the torus tree, right? And so, you know, yeah, we're going to launch guys like companies Headliners, but we're going to take this year to really go hard. The Taurus tree because then it becomes undeniable.	
1	Yeah, meaning like like putting them in the market. Yeah.	
2	This is the size plus the history equals moving up right now. So that's the move their champagne drip. He's we have a headline tour. We're going to announce, you know, we'll be announcing soon made. Yeah. Yeah.	
1	Yeah. One thing I saw that you were doing is like pairing your guys to up like festivals.	
2	Oh, yeah the be to B's, you know, I hope my guys Evans going to be doing something with company.	
1	So you're just trying to create kind. Like a like a umbrella they can all be under like fucking with each other like that like a crew.	
2	Yeah, you know the guys that I rock like on sound like on my you know, I'm standing on my Instagram bio or whatever like the guys that actually say that I officially manage. There's been like multiple approvals from all my artists.	
1	I'm going to make sure they Brock each other you like like if you're going to pick up a guy do you like call your guys and go like, yeah. I'm thinking about these guys. Like do you do you get a feel for what they feel about it, do you?	
2	Yeah, I like there's just a lot of moving Parts when it comes to you know, working with an artist and obviously getting feedback from you know, other artists who you respect and that are you know, even better under your own umbrella like is the best way to do it. Yeah in my opinion at least in the base world, you know, when I start expanding more like outside of the the genre which will eventually be someday, you know, the it may be a little different but for now, yeah bass is like super clicky.	
1	No, I mean like not in a bad way. It's just like realistically in Bass music. It's like who fucks with you is what makes you big like mostly they only there only friends are other base artist. It's because obviously our crew is more of the European guys. We tell them that were friends with like some of the base guys are like those guys. Talk to you man. We're like, yeah, I don't know.	
2	Yeah everything how many artists do you have right now, so I have five	
1	Official clients Yeah official like guys that you're like that are sign. Yeah, like everyone so like you have artists that you're maybe like I have during developing like developments some guys that I helped with their releases work. So you like find a guy and he's just not quite there yet and you're like, I'm gonna help you get to the point where I would manage you or like what's that conversation?	
2	Like the workflow doesn't really change so much. It just comes down to like it's almost like a trial period type stuff because I'm so on the ground with my guys, you know, I send them notes. I want to make sure they're stacking. Properly, you know, it's just like anything before you announce something you want to make sure that things are everything's like running smoothly, you know on both ends say, you know, I want to make sure that whatever service I'm providing is good for them. I want to make sure that they're giving me the you know, the the plenty to play with per se, you know, like want to make sure yeah, how many clients is too many okay for like a manager that like you're not a new manager but you're you know new earn a sense of like there's a lot of it has been the games like 20 years like that varies to I Think you know, I can't imagine the workflow keeping up with like Morgan it gets artist with every different ya know for me. It's you know, I when it comes to really really really new like clients that aren't like touring at and stuff. I really only take on two at once Yeah.	
1	Well, yeah because at first at first it's costing you money to like manage guys, if you're not if you're an artist not making any money essentially if you have like any sort of Team behind you or like an assistant an intern social media person. It's like it's if they're not Bringing in income. It's costing you money essentially to manage them.	
2	Oh, yeah, I would imagine that you can't manage to many of those and it's really Hands-On to because in the beginning a lot of the artists, they don't really, you know, understand, you know, the concept of you know, stacking records just the whole business, you know, the how much rejection there is no man. Yeah, you know, so it's a lot of like, you know kind of hand-holding in the beginning but you know as a former artist, I really like I've always just wanted to be the manager that you know, I wanted per se, you know, and so	
1	so yeah, I was gonna say like, how is that buffer like because you're pretty much the buffer between them and rejection, right? So like when you get do you like have to like set up this conversation in your head? Like alright this label turned down with like, you know, fuck these these motherfuckers. Like, how do you do you like you're like you're like now we don't want to be there. Anyway, like how do you approach a conversation? Like you send a record that the artist loves with the label doesn't love it.	
2	Like how do you say I'm really like really just up front about it because one of my big pet peeves with even dealing with like other people in the industry. Is like they'll lag on response just to like avoid you know, like disappointing somebody. Yeah, and for me, I'd much rather a mean it's just almost like, you know dating it's like, you know, I'd rather just be upfront and be like, hey, like, you know, this is you know, it's not working and you know, hey like out there and fucking move on like exactly like it may hurt in the beginning but at least like you're being blunt and honest up front, right? Yeah.	
1	So so in like a new artist, like what do you you know, like what are you cause we were like, Talking to will and I was like, what do you what do you like search for man? Like and I got a new artists and he was like I search for two things that he needs right? He was like either look for somebody who's a fucking Superstar. Yeah, or I look for somebody who is ridiculous at producing. He's like if we can have both like nightmare has both you know what I mean? Like if I have somebody that has both that's a fucking slam dunk, but he's like, I need one or the other so like you're looking for an artist. What do you like like? Oh shit. This guy caught my fucking I like And you know, what are you looking for?	
2	So honestly, I agree with Will on those things. I would add one thing to it for me. I really want to make sure that whoever I work with is has like realistic expectations in his patient. Yeah, because you know, there could be a superstar that freaking takes five years to pop ya stand that doesn't understand that and is like throwing you on the chopping block after like few. Months and they don't have any traction. Yeah, you know, there's people like that out there, you know, so it's you gotta it's the workflow for me is the most important, you know, but you obviously like if it just comes down to just finding somebody. Yeah.	
1	I mean like you're you approach an artist. You're like, yeah. I want to manage you are you like before I can even think about that like I need 20 records.	
2	Like are you like are is it like that kind of thing or like our like how does it you know, I'm definitely more prone to make someone like official when I have, you know stuff that I can actually like work on it, which is No content. Um, but yeah, you know say there's an artist that you know, I'm talking to and I really think that potential and they're not sitting a lot of music. That's when we get in development mode, right?	
1	All right, cool, like lets, you know, are you like hopping in the studio with them and like, you know, like let's crank this shit out like not in person.	
2	But you know, like I'll I'll I'll send you know, I was to say they send me like an MP3 and rather than me some like notes or whatever like a paragraph and notes. I'll just be like, hey give me the MP3. I'll throw in an Ableton and I'll splice I'll slice it up and like change the arrangement and I'll be like hey, this is where I want to hear right and then they'll either take it or not. The typically it helps with the creative process so good that you can do that.	
1	You can like throw that you can put it into Ableton like, you know, a lot of managers like our manager I love them to death.	
2	But but that's what I'm saying. Everyone's got their own like their own like skills in the beginning, you know for me. It was like really Hands-On creative work right now. That was I took that and ran you know it I learned the touring aspect later. Yeah, but you know more like you know in real time as my guy started to grow.	
1	So how does that how does that with a the the touring aspect? So like what because when we started we already had a tour history, so I I've never had to start from ground zero on the touring aspect as a DJ. How do you know what the right because it's so about like coming in strong as a headliner or coming in, you know, like it's such like a weird game. Like how do you know how to play that fucking? Yeah, like, how does it go in?	
2	Reality, you know textbook everyone wants to like hold out till they're just worth crazy money as a headliner. But at the same time like if you don't ever have that hit you also need to know how to break an artist from you know, the ground up and touring and foot, you know with Footprints, you know building value returning to markets.	
1	Yeah, we hear we hear about so many things like I hear so many managers like no you just got to hold out till your headliner and it's like yeah, but like what there is another strategy like you can build by supporting and like	
2	Going higher and I'll treat it like, you know, I'm a baseball player and like I treat it like a baseball analogy. Yeah. I still I play in Sunday League Lee would like wood bat not softball. Yeah, so I treat it like you can either be swinging for the fences like a home run hitter, you know, a lot of big home run hitters also have high strikeout average or you can be a player that hits for batting average, right? You know, there's a lot of really big like Hall of Famer baseball players that had high batting. Average not a lot of home runs. Yeah.	
1	Well, so not everybody not everybody is going to be a marshmallow story. You know what I mean? Like, it's just not it's just not realistic to think that everyone's going to be like that like obviously there are the guys like that like, I feel like sudden death came in and he's just a headliner. It's like not everybody's gonna it's not gonna happen with everybody.	
2	I mean look at artists like, you know dirt monkey and even liquid stranger like these guys are really doing the business and you know, they just get called followings for you know, who they are and how they You know how they're impacting, you know, whatever Market there were playing and you know, yeah.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. I see like look a good example of like somebody like I saw like come up like, you know a lot a lot of the house guys, honestly, like like the afro Jacks and The Nicky Romero's and stuff like those guys signed to like David Guetta early on and we're like opening for him and like Afrojack played the changeover set it Ultra for 15 minutes the first time you played Ultra, you know what I mean? It's like there is a way to like build careers and I think it's cool that you're like willing to like get in the being in the ground and like do that. Yeah, you're not just like I'm going to find this kid. We're going to throw a fucking meme up there and like hope he can headline, you know, but, you know, I want to be able to do both.	
2	I want to be able to find an artist that I think has potential and you know, make them make them good, you know, get make a career for them without relying on a hip but I would also, you know, we're always prepping for a hit, you know, but that I don't want that to like stunts the project you'd	
1	There are hit take them to the next level as opposed to a hit make their entire career.	
2	I mean it's not even a rather either or it's just like you got to be ready for any of it. Like if there's an artist I believe in yeah, obviously we want always prep for the hit but I also want to make sure that we're firing on all cylinders. Not just on that one.	
1	You know, I think it's yeah, it's hard for artists to get in that mentality where I have to have a hit. I have to have a hit because if you get into that mentality so much pressure and you instantly can't release any music because you think everything you do sucks and	
2	you're overthinking it and then all of a sudden you're like in this weird like, okay, like I'm fucked, you know, and that's that and that's only the first part of it like think about like when you're hitting up a label for money and you want to get radio promo and it when you think it's a it could be a hit like there's so many moving Parts.	
1	Yeah for is insane. Yeah. So speaking on labels like with all your guys do you feel like because a lot of kids now ask us like, oh like, how do I get signed? How do I get this and it's like we're in the conversation a lot now, we're like You don't necessarily even have to get signed any more like obviously it helps and I think in base world that could help if you're like part of a never-say-die or like I was LE or like a but now there's this whole new business strategy where like you don't even need to get signed. Like if you could build a self-sustaining business yourself on dsps. It's like you don't need a label. Obviously. There's like pros and cons for all your guys. Are you going to label route? Do you suggest the label route? Do you suggest the Indie route for some guys? Like how do you kind of navigate that situation?	
2	So yeah, I mean we go to Bore out we don't sign an exclusive video on we got some like handshake stuff. You never said I would like company but you know, he's still steps out. You know, they've been there really cool about it, you know, they're they're down for the cause and thing, you know him growing, you know independent I think is great if you can do it, but you need to have a certain amount of you know sighs I would say if you really want it to be substantial and you know, if you really want to like tunecore it and expect like plays on. modify and all that like there's a lot There's a there's a lot of back and you need like you need to kind of create like a budget. I mean unless an artist just happen magically has money before their tour like going Independence really tough. If you really want to compete with the labels because they say if you're independent you're competing against, you know, some big labels release that week so have their relationships to put their song. Yeah any other exactly so yeah, I mean Independence great, but if you want to you know, and I totally condone it, but you just have to keep in mind what you're actually Eating with if you want to play you have to know that you have to know the level of work. Yeah, actually, yeah exactly because you had cool push it out great. But like you know, how is it going to stand against? You know say a spinning track or a never-say-die track or even I mean even Upstream tracks that are you know poking in and out of the opposite is true in like yeah, I think I think a lot of people that go there just like yeah, we're going independent.	
1	It's like a great cool. Do you good for you? Good you think about what you need to do to do that, you know because I saw a lot of I've seen a lot of guys like leave spinning and they like go this like other route and their careers like tank and I always you come back. It was just always come back and I don't even think it's because you can't go independent and be successful. It's because I don't think they understand like The label was doing all these things that you don't even know they were doing and you were complaining the whole time. But now you're on your own and none of those things are getting done in your seeing the reality of like oh shit. Like I need to shoot my own video. I need to hit up Kramer. I need to get a YouTube channel all these things.	
2	That's why I like, you know saving, you know when you guys get your label, you know, it's like having someone running being like, you know, managing managing the label that that's like your eyes and ears. Yeah. You know for you know that thing they're going to be the ones really, I mean you as obviously bring in like artists and stuff but like in terms of all like the NIT grit stuff like the dealing with the we talk about all the time.	
1	I push it that we're going to do metadata. You know, I'm not gonna be sitting on a computer like I love the meta dad.	
2	I was like that's not gonna happen going back and forth on like legal threads that take for freaking ever like, you know, that's that's your, you know, every label is going to need like, you know, and needs, you know eyes and ears labeled. Yeah. Exactly. And that's the layer manager. Is it Sighs and you Of see if whether it's the CEO CFO of the company or its the label is like an artist run label, you know, that's and I'm getting Doug on. Yeah, the dog is going bad side buddy speaking about dsps.	
1	One thing. I thought is interesting and you manage predominately base guys.	
2	That's just yeah, that's just what kind of what's kind of, you know been you know lucrative on the tour front.	
1	I obviously I started I was he it's such a crazy business thing because we come from like house world and pop world and stuff like this where I come from. Yeah. Our artist that's where we are we live but the one thing that's so crazy to me is that base artists on dsps? Not really killing it like even excision 400,000 monkey lizard. Yeah, but they sell so many tickets and it's such a weird connection, right? Like what do you think that is like why? Why do you feel like a excision track highest track? He has is probably five million streams, but he can sell 20,000 tickets.	
2	What is the break it down for us? We all come from this world. It's the difference between Like the the emo pop in the metal. Yeah, it's the same thing. You know, it's like the guys who are wearing. Emo and we're crossing over in that whole Rock thing in the early 2000s. They were you know, obviously selling a lot of tickets but also like killing it in sales, right? Whereas like, you know, the metal guys, the the quota for sales was we're a little less on records, but they were selling crazy ticket. Yeah, and the dubstep fans are just like metal fans. It's so weird. This is no loyalty is like there.	
1	There's a weird CD store where these dubstep kids are going. And buying the CDs because it's like where are you listening to the music?	
2	You just gotta think like emo bubbles kind of similar to the dance bubbles that I wasn't seeing in the way, it's these I feel like it's just so much more loyal like don't metal though those 400,000 streams that excision has on a song every one of those streams is from one kid. That's going to go to one of his show your I mean rather than you can have a song that has 50 million streams people can't bring a hundred people to a show and not just buy tickets to the show by buy all their merch, you know, so it's like fan for life. Like that's the hundred fan thing like,	
1	The equity decision to sold 20,000 bucking tickets at NAS events center and I think literally has highest song has 5 million streams may be 10 10 million, which it's a hundred fan thing.	
2	It's like, you know, what would you rather have like a million Facebook followers or would you rather have like like a hundred people that will buy a ticket to every one of your shows and by every piece of your merge. Yeah, you know, it's true.	
1	Yeah. It really is like that loyal DieHard fucking, you know fan base. Obviously if you guys got a crazy vocal for a Company, like I feel like you'd probably like swing for it. You know, if you have like a hit Uncle you thought was a hit you probably like. All right. Yeah, we're gonna give this a fucking shot.	
2	Well, yeah and you know, and that's what's cool too is, you know, he's able to invest now because he's been you know working really hard touring. He's good with his money.	
1	Are you are you helping these guys like with Finance finances are you like I do they all have business managers. Are you kind of like stepping in like, hey like take it from me save money for saving money right now taxes.	
2	You're right now. It's about just In the bottom line and you know, I mean obviously, you know, they're doing they're doing pretty well, but they don't have business managers just yet. Yeah, but we're going to get there. We want to find the right people dude.

Yeah, that's where in so it's like yeah, I mean, it's really Case by case when it comes to recommending business managers at any at any level, you know, so you're from you're from La.	
1	Yeah born and we were we were pretty much grew up like right next to each other. Yes, I grew up in Studio City like which is like kind of the Piedmont bottom of the Hollywood Hills what got you like into the music business like what like like when I met you, I know that you like come from like a guitar background like fucking shredding. Yeah are like you were like us who grew up like a metal fuck. Like yeah, how do you go from you start like bands?	
2	I'm assuming probably like when you're younger I got actually got into producing because you know, I know I know music theory and all that stuff. So I would be the ID that one band member when I be starting bands. I'd write the music for everyone and I got so heavily into like the you know, the like metalcore like shredding stuff. Like I don't know II trouble like keeping people around or having people I could keep up with like the crazy shit that I was like writing. So I took to write it all in this thing called tab it was This like I remember that you could like enter you could like enter like guitar tabs.	
1	Yeah to have it into like a software that weird like the kind of a guitar noise to that.	
2	It sounded like a like a yeah, like a monophonic like like Nokia of ringtone, but I didn't realize until college that what what I was doing was was dot was dot work. I was producing music. I was writing full songs and midi. Yeah, and I didn't even realize it and then I got Ableton and I was like, oh, this is like the same shit just way more complex sounds of always midi. I just yeah, so I mean, so in terms of sequencing I always had like a leg up but then it took me, you know, obviously just like everyone Forever learn how to like process everything and all that stuff. And yeah, I thought I fell in love with it. And that was kind of where it began, you know?	
1	Yeah, like your metal kid you you start fucking around like Ableton essentially then you just fall in love with like dance music and your your group charity strike was like it was like big room house pretty much like at that at the core of it was pretty much bigger than yeah.	
2	We are one of those axelle like we kind of you know, we won some like be poor remix contest doing base kind of like some dubstep stuff and then we A jumped into like doing house stuff like that kind of the big room thing when that was like happening and got some traction and then sort of you know, right it was that was really at the tail end when like artists were touring big awful like a big remix or something. Yeah. It was the golden fucking are a man.	
1	We're all you have to do is make a big remix. I was just like man stage Ultraman.	
2	We just flip this fucking karelis on what exactly and and you know, it was it was cool. He had a good like you, you know year-round like, you know being for people and If way we're getting the right looks shout out, you know Andrew who's now became his manager. He was our agent. Yeah. Yeah, he killed it for us. But you know sometimes you know, if a project isn't working it gets hard. Yeah, and you know, I always saw the side of it, you know, like, you know, the our manager and agent of the time like I understood, you know, and then I just I just I just had an epiphany and then started I want to work towards You know building actual industry experience and learning the back end, right?	
1	Yeah what you were I mean you while you were in the project you were working at Dimock records to uh, yeah and your tour managing right as all the same time. I was out a little bit after Mike is Mike is an all-around Hustler pretty much about Mike is this story is very interesting you like went from like being in a metal band starting like a big room house Duo working at Dimock tour managing board just like you've done is a renaissance man of EDM. Mike might be fucking personal training people right now to I think I like I guess a business Mogul.	
2	Yeah, whatever whatever whatever got to do is survive. Yeah.	
1	Yeah, you're just one of those guys. You've always been one of those guys were like this to like you like making yourself busy. You know what I mean? Like, you're the kind of guy that will create jobs for yourself because you hate not doing shit.	
2	Well, yeah, and I'm always one that wants to grow and I'm very realistic. You know, I'm not going to ever really feel comfortable say like, you know financially or whatever like I'm always going to be like grinding We're never going to you know be content with where I'm at. And I'm never too. I'll never really be to like say like to I don't know in a sense like too big for a job or somebody. I'm always grind it out. Yeah, like a bowl to hustle exactly. I'm always going to want to be there to help people out and be a beyond the net grid of things, you know, and and you're one of those guys you go a hundred and ten, you know what I mean?	
1	Like well, yeah you see you like you're like, all right. I'm gonna eat good. I'm gonna meal prep seven days a week. I'm going to man. I'm going to manage all these motherfuckers. I'm gonna I'm gonna produce I'm gonna produce all the way you like work to Dimock you were doing like 13 jobs that you don't even need to do. You're just one of those dudes which I like go after lot and babe goes after lot. Like you're one of those guys, you're not half-assing shit. You're gonna go a hundred and ten all the time. Yeah. It's something that we like we get the end all time and kids like what do you what's your suggestion to like making it this and that I'm like dude this industry the music industry in general like being the most talented. It's one thing. I mean, obviously if you're Zed and you're like, Literally the most talented person in the room. Okay, but for the most part, it's can you out grind the next guy? Well, yeah realistic, you know what I mean?	
2	It's all survival. Dude. We're all like entrepreneurs partnering up with other entrepreneurs, you know, like some of these entrepreneurs are like, you know have a chair out an office but it's you know, we're all just that's why it's so wild west in the music initiative, you know Wild West everyone kind of owns their own operation.	
1	No, we're just a bunch of degenerates. I mean realistically We like all of us were just band kids or DJ kids or whatever. None of us are like none of us are like School smart, like pretty much we're all pretty like weirded. We're guys that couldn't get our brains to work like everybody else. So we started our own fucking planet called the music industry. I mean like I talked about all the time. People are like, yeah, this A&R said this or that I'm like, okay most likely this A&R was a failed musician. So he was like, I didn't make it as a musician. So now I'm going to be an r and then now they're like the biggest and around the world. Let's say but it's like he's still a degenerate man. Like it's still a guy who didn't want to get a real job. So he works at a label. I mean that's that's the real, you know, like the president of democra Kurds. It's like he just didn't want to go work at fucking Microsoft or like wherever our be a lawyer like everybody else, you know, so it's it is the Wild West it's funny that you said that's that's a good way to put it true.	
2	Yeah, man, they all yeah that really any rules. You just kind of like the only rules like just be like nice and respect everybody. And other than that, it's like you don't have to be anywhere any I mean if you don't want to go to a show, you don't have to go if you don't want to go to the office, like I feel like you don't have to go. Yeah.	
1	Listen, I've never worked in a music business office, but I feel like people had in. My probably just weren't coming today. I feel like you go there like drunk even you don't even like you show up to your work. Hey, we met with them. It seemed like people in there were drunk.	
2	Yeah. No, I mean they run they run a clean operation, you know, but you know, they they have I mean, there are people working under them the rules and all that sort of clear that up they do actually	
1	In operating buddy democracy strong you are do you still chat with those guys that I is it even the same people there anymore?	
2	Boom finale all the time.	
1	I still see Lauren who is like exploring all everywhere because he's really close with Austin. So every time we're around or isn't funny guy.	
2	Yeah, it's great. I mean he was one of the first people to really believe in like me is like an individual like and on a music industry standpoint, you know, yeah.	
1	So you also do you like run a lot of people's like broadcast shows to write or I don't know if you do that anymore. I Do you like your first leg into like the industry?	
2	I kept me alive doing you know doing the you know, helping with the SiriusXM shows engineering track listing, whatever.	
1	Yeah, I helped you a lot on the A and our perspective of knowing what was a good record because you were just getting so many records over sure.	
2	I mean that was also a way that I would discover artist who I mean that was how I discovered like is in the beginning a promo for somebody like kind of an improvement. Well, who is this good? Yes, I mean that's always been cool having like my finger on the pulse of that sort of stuff. But you know, I never when it came to like radio production stuff. I didn't have once again like the passion to like create my own like noise house. I probably could have one point where like go work at Sirius XM is like a program. It wasn't like your passion could have created like a business that competes with these Titans, but I just, you know, I wanted to get in the manufacturing side.	
1	Yeah, you know, it was a means to an end. It was like a it was a it was a you paid rent from it. It wasn't like your main priority.	
2	Yeah becoming a line for sure.	
1	How did you like? How did you liked or because you tore managed?	
2	Sorry. I'm talking to your doctor. Stop it.	
1	He's biting on Mikey you tore managed Borgeous and like karela for a second, right? Yeah. So like, how did you how did you find the tour management side compared to like the management side, really really really different.	
2	Yeah. I mean it really just depends on the shared the share. Duties per se because when I was when I was doing borders, I was doing his day-to-day management to so is like a combined gig. Whereas like Cruella when I was, you know, helping them out on the road. I was basically just filling in for like a few months was cool. I love the girls, but you know, they had they had their day two days and basically at base, you know, Mission Control, you know, I'd go to the day-to-day is for everything, you know, so yeah.	
1	Yeah, so it's a different just a different lifestyle pretty much different types of formatting.	
2	Yeah. I mean, it's basically, you know, you're the artist. Road. Yeah, and then that's cool. You know, I I think it's a great rewarding gig and I recommend anybody that really wants to like learn the back end of the industry and touring to get into it. Yeah.	
1	Yeah, I learned I really wanted to have you on here is because a lot of kids don't know how to get from A to B. And it's like your story really is like a to be story. It's like it's like local band kid to touring DJ. Yeah to the label side of things to tour manager to full-time manager. It's like you really went up the fucking Mountain like	
2	You no way no, I didn't I didn't come from you know, I mean, my mom is a big TV writer, you know, but like I you know the film it's not as like entrepreneurial, you know, you work for the studio, so I didn't come from like a really entrepreneurial family, right? And so I had to figure all this shit out like on my own and so it just it took a little longer, but I'm finally kind of rolling with the you know, the freedom per se and I really like it.	
1	Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess for to wrap it up like a kid writes you Wants to be a manager. You're like, alright, you don't know anything about it. What's like your go? All right. This is how you start like, let's let's get the fucking ball rolling.	
2	So you say something like that like a kid?	
1	Yeah that comes to you. Like I want to be a man's First Step. What was the first act like, how do you how do you get going?	
2	I would try to work. I would try to get like an it's like a young kid or like a student. I would try to get like an internship or you know, like like a gig working at one of these these companies say like a red light or a UTA I mean or label even you know, you'll either one you'll learn about the label side. You'll learn about the manufacturing site or learn about the booking side. And then from there really get good at one of those and then from there if you will save going to be manager use that one Edge you have and then learn them the best you go as you go. Yeah, but yeah, but you got one really one really strong strength. I can help an artist in the beginning. Yeah.
