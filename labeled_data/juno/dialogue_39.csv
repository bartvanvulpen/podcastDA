3	Hey podcast people. How's it going? As Iran the language nerd here. Hope you're doing very very well on this fine Tuesday afternoon or whatever day and time it is for you right now.	
1	As you're listening to this podcast episode. I'm your host as per usual Azran the language nerd you can find me primarily on Facebook Instagram Snapchat YouTube LinkedIn. And of course on Tick-Tock my username on all these platforms is identical. It is at polyglot Azran that is spelled Pol y GL OT a zed or Z depending on your country re n you can also simply search as Iran the language nerd on whatever your favorite social network is so again that is spelled po or excuse me, that is felt a zed or Z re n the language nerd and welcome to another podcast episode.	
3	I am very very excited as per usual to be recording this one here. I have a lot of different things on my mind for today's podcast. And so let's just Dive Right In the first one. Is that my life. Is not in a very good balance right now. I've been talking about this on various social networks over the past over the past little while and I want to talk about it and discuss the discuss this topic on the podcast. I think if we attack this if we attack this topic and we discuss this topic and we and we delve into this topic. I think it can help a lot of people who are listening to this podcast and I think it'll actually be very very good for myself as well. I find that when I talk about	
1	Whether it's to myself in this kind of podcast form or to someone else in real life or whatever it is often. It really helps me. So, you know the past I would say three to six weeks and most facets of my life.	
3	I'm not super happy with how I have been choosing to spend my time. When I look at my personal time, even though I have personal time and I'm putting time and energy towards things that matter to me that I enjoy. I'm not spending them in the way that makes me happiest. For example, when I look at the amount of YouTube, I'm watching I enjoy watching YouTube that is something I enjoy doing in my free time. But I'm so I'm watching too much like I would rather be doing other things with my free time and not spend that much time watching YouTube in other words. Maybe I'm watching whatever it is 5 hours of YouTube in a few day span and instead, I'd rather I'd rather be watching 3 hours of YouTube and doing two hours of hanging out with the Friend or something like that. I'm just not happy with the balance of where my free time is going at work. I'm also not happy.	
1	I'm working as much as I typically do not is not really something that is changed.	
3	But when I look at what elements of my work, I am putting at my attention on I don't feel right about it. I think it's too much time going towards certain things and not enough time going towards other things and that is a little bit of a problem when I look at my health and nutrition.	
1	I'm not really happy with where it is.	
3	I am sleeping about the same as I typically do but I'm not getting the same quality of sleep that I would like to be getting in comparison to what I used to get. I'm not getting the same quality and I feel that and I don't like that. I look at my nutrition and I'm not eating as well as I would like to be eating and I haven't been doing exercise for a good six weeks. Now, that's a problem. I was in a really good stretch for anybody who remembers when I came back from Taiwan. One I had a really good habit in place for a long time. There was a good I mean, I don't know four or five maybe more months where I was doing really well with my acting my physical activity and fitness and things like that and the past six weeks. I've fallen out of a lot of those those positive those positive habits and you know, these are things that are not good and I want to share this here because I think there's probably a lot of you who Either a are listening to this and thinking to yourself that man.	
1	I'm in a similar position right now.	
3	I'm not super happy with the balance of where I'm spending my time, and I'm not happy with the decisions that I'm making and even if you don't feel that now odds are that you felt it before or you're going to feel it at some point in the future and in my experience whether it has to do with language learning or really any topic, sometimes it's really difficult to see where	
1	You are like to see to really understand what you're feeling until you hear someone else talk about that feeling often with myself. I find that someone will say something that I believe in and that I have believed in for a long time or that or that I feel I feel the same way as the person who said it but I didn't consciously realize that I felt that way until that person said it and then I'm like, right I believe that you just put that you said that That in such a clear way and I didn't know how to express that feeling that I had inside me.	
3	Great. I have this extra level of clarity. And so hopefully me sharing this can give a couple of you an extra level of clarity of aha, that's kind of what's going on right now. That's why I don't feel quite right. That's why I'm not as happy as I typically am right now or like oh right six months ago.	
1	That's why I wasn't feeling quite good.	
3	I wasn't doing blah blah blah. So hopefully this helps a couple of you. How you know reach that extra level of clarity? I will share this today is a much better day for me and yesterday evening to about and yesterday as a whole lot actually has been a much better the past couple of days have been a lot better and I have been better with that level of balance. For example yesterday when I eat when I ate dinner, I had a cucumber like half of a maybe 40% of a long cucumber and I had half of an avocado with my dinner. That was a good decision. I have not been eating enough vegetables with my dinner for quite some time. So I felt really good about that. I had a pre bedtime snack and I ate spinach with my snack. Like I had some hummus. I had some some pita bread with it. And then I had some spinach and I was like, yeah, this is again not the most healthiest amazing thing in the world, but definitely pretty damn good. So, you know, I slept a lot better I made. Sure that I made the right decisions to make sure I can get a better quality of sleep. So ultimately I'm doing a lot better and I want to continue that continue that positive that positive momentum changing gears a little bit. I want to go in a language learning Direction seeing as this is obviously a language learning related podcast.	
1	Um, and I I want to talk about something that has been on my mind which is about Rote memorization or rather wrote language learning strategies.	
3	Maybe that's a better way to put it.	
1	So when you look at a lot of language learning classrooms and quite honestly, when you look at the mains many of the mainstream beliefs around how one should learn a language based on their personal experiences. There's quite a few people who believe in and very let's call it traditional wrote style of language learning strategies things like doing a whole bunch of work.	
3	Eats things like writing out verbs over and over and writing out their conjugations things like doing a whole bunch of repetitive practice dialogues from a textbook.	
1	These are things that people many people around the globe around the world that they do and I want to spend a minute or two discussing these because I personally am a little bit maybe a little bit conflicted about them on one hand. I believe that they are ineffective and they're not very	
3	why they're not great because they're so done engaging they're so boring most of the time and therefore it's something that is difficult to learn from often when it comes to learning a new skill. It has to be something that engages the mind and that gets you interested that keeps you engaged for lack of a better term. On the flip side a part of me also believes that these rote learning strategies are also quite effective and can really assist language Learners quite a bit because when you take out a piece of paper and you do these drills and you're writing out these verbs over and over or if you're doing spoken drills with different with different, what do you call it with different?	
1	Repeating certain scripts over and over like repeating. Hola como estas. Oh, I stoie bien Hi, how are you? Oh, I'm doing really good. How about you doing that repetition over and over will help it stick and I'm conflicted and I'm trying to figure out in my own mind. Like where is the line is it effective is not effective. Should we be doing rote learning strategies?	
3	Should we not I think my opinion as of today as I'm recording this in December of 2019. I think we're my mind and where my beliefs relieved lie, as of right now is that they work rote learning strategies are effective but only to an extent. So if you're struggling to remember for instance, the past tense conjugations conjugation rules for verbs in Spanish and you just cannot remember them and you keep forgetting them. I believe that it is going to be an effective activity and an effective drill.	
1	You just sit down for 20 minutes a day and actually write out seven different verbs in the past tense.	
3	I ate you ate.	
1	He ate she ate we ate in Spanish.	
3	It's way more complex than not an English is actually pretty easy.	
1	It's always ate but write it out over and over and over do it with another verb right out some practice sentences do the same thing again tomorrow.	
3	I think that can have that. I'm be effective and eventually your your brain is going to remember. Oh, yeah, I ate you ate it all over. Oh, yeah. I did. I walked I and your brains gonna start getting used to it and you are going to become a lot more familiar with that over time by doing those kinds of wrote boring types of activities. But here's the catch. This is where might this is my opinion as of today. There's a catch where eventually The effectiveness of the wrote style of learning where it tapers off. It doesn't quite it doesn't help you as much after a certain point and you have to start following up that rote learning strengths look rote learning strategy with other types of strategies. So for example, you know, let's say I was consistently forgetting some verb conjugation. Let's stick with that example and I spent all this time writing and over and over I did these written drills I did worksheet. It's and now my brain understands these conjugation rules on a theoretical level. If you give me a worksheet, if you tell me to write it out I can do it. But now in order to transfer that skill into a real-world environment where when you're speaking with an actual native speaker, and you actually are in a situation where you must you have a need of communicating something incorrect, you know in a grammatically correct way and saying it properly and getting your point across, you know, that's it. French skill set. And even though you've done a hundred worksheets, even though you've written it out a million times, even though you've done those you've done your role plays in class, right? Even though you've done it.	
1	It's a completely different skill set being able to apply that in a real-world environment and you will likely have to practice in real-world environments for the skill of writing it out on paper and doing rote memorization style drills. You're going to have to do something different in order to transfer that skill over. / and apply it in the real world.	
3	In fact this in my perspective as I'm pondering this right now. I actually think many skills and life work this way.	
1	If you look at being a I don't know being a surgeon my assumption.	
3	I don't know a lot about being a surgeon but my assumption is that you've got to write a lot of theoretical tests. You need to really understand on a theoretical level.	
1	How does the body work?	
3	What is human anatomy? Like, you know you have to The organs you have to understand the theory of what kind of scalpel is this? What kind of knife do you use in this situation? How do you operate on a kidney?	
1	How do you operate on a foot? How do you do this? How do you work that machine? What do you do if the blood pressure drops during the surgery?	
3	What do you do if the person wakes up from the anesthesia?	
1	I'm sure those all sorts of theory that these surgeons have to learn but being able to apply that theory in a real-world is something that's completely	
3	lately different because maybe they know okay if the person starts to wake up from the anesthesia, you know, I'm supposed to follow this procedure.	
1	I don't even know what the procedure is, but I'm sure there's a procedure to follow but maybe what they didn't expect is a person wakes up from anesthesia and they start to get scared and like oh my God, what do I do? And then the nurse who's helping you out knocks the scalpel off of the counter because she got startled and you're like oh and then you get startled you being able to Handle that situation is completely different than you being able to write the test and and complete the test in a classroom environment though for you to even have a shot at having any level of success in the operating room.	
3	You probably would have had to have learned the theory and studied the theory to an extent and done some of the memorization drills and written the test done.	
1	All of that. You would have had to have done a bunch of that first in order to even have the shot and a prey	
3	Rare of being allowed into the operating room while language learning is nowhere near a life-and-death scenarios such as an operating room potentially could be and there are there are way less dire consequences of making a mistake with a language. Then there are in an operating room as a surgeon.	
1	I think in many ways these Concepts kind of apply if you haven't studied something in a classroom environment. In fact, let me rephrase that if you haven't learned how something Works and on a theoretical on a knowledge base level whether that be in a classroom environment whether that be because you have someone taught it to you whether that be because you followed a study at home program hack whether that be because you went to a real life scenario made a mistake and learn from the mistake and you thought about it and he pondered it and blah blah blah, you know, and unless you'd actually spend some time learning how something worked there's no way you're gonna be able to properly apply it in their interest.	
3	In a real-world scenario, it's going to be really difficult and therefore using a rote learning strategy is one of many techniques that any of that language Learners can utilize in order to learn the theoretical side of how something works in a foreign language. Please understand that it's not the only way that's not the only way that a language learner can learn the theory there are so many other ways you could do it, but I think Stan's my position as of today as of this December 2019 is that rote learning strategies are not necessarily bad, but it's less than half the equation. It's just one tool that partially remedies and partially solves the problem of not knowing how a specific thing works in a language and being able to get closer to understanding it digesting it and being able to apply it but it's not going to be the only thing that one has to utilize it reminds me actually have a podcast. I heard it reminded me of I don't know if you guys know of The Joe Rogan podcast. I don't list. I think it's called The Joe Rogan Experience. I don't listen to every single episode to be perfectly honest. I just listen to certain clips from time to time on YouTube. If I if it happens to come across my feed and there is this one interview this one clip that I listen to whether discussing they were discussing. It was either being	
1	Bodybuilder and something with physical fitness or it was around financial success. I don't remember what the exact conversation was.	
3	My gut is telling me right now that it was about physical fitness that's kind of where my mind is going and her on bodybuilding.	
1	It's kind of like saying if you look at bodybuilders, you know, all of them have big muscles and let's assume that they're very very strong and very good shape and it's like saying, oh all of them drink Water that's why they have big muscles. It's not true. Right? Yes. They drink a lot of water. Yes, that is important. Yes, that is something they have to do but it's not the only part of the equation they do so much more. They go to the gym. They eat a certain way. They have personal trainers. They they they learn about how the Body Works they they learn about how to recover when they have an injury, they learn the so much that they do and it's not just about drinking water and I think that	
3	When you look at these wrote strategies and really any language learning strategy, I think anytime someone goes and puts all their eggs in one basket and they say that this strategy is the way you know, I always go in my mind.	
1	Yeah in many ways sure.	
3	Yes, and it's probably a part of the equation most likely or it'll work for some people but not exactly for everyone and this that the other thing so this is a definitely a massive thing that was on my mind today that I wanted. To share on the podcast the final thing.	
1	I want to share and then we'll wrap this podcast episode up has to do with my personal Mandarin my personal Mandarin studies and I want to share a learning point that I've had a bit of a realization that I've had that I believe can help a lot of the people listening here on this podcast episode. So recently in Mandarin, I've hit this kind of level of comfort. I've hit this this point where I'm like, wow, you know what you could stick. In front of native speakers and while I'm might still struggle while I don't know all the words while I still haven't studied all the grammar. I've achieved a certain level of comfort where I don't get as nervous as I used to and I'm able to navigate situations way more than I could before I had a I had the situation yesterday where I was with a friend of mine and we were hanging out and she speaks Mandarin.	
3	We only speak in Mandarin together. It's kind of a new friend that I've made recently. And she was helping me with some my Mandarin studies. I helped her with some Spanish and English things like that. She helps me with mandarin and we're sitting there together and we're going through this particular page in my textbook and she's like has earned.	
1	You're still taking Chinese classes and I was like, yeah, I still take classes. I'm still learning. Like I still have a long ways to go and she goes but but you can understand everything I say and we can talk about anything and you can get your point across. I understand you you understand everything I say. She's like, why are you learning? She's like, why are you learning Mandarin? Why are you continuing her studies and makes no sense. You're already fluent and that in that moment. I was like, oh is that how I'm viewed by many people are there people that view me that way like, oh, he's fluent. Why is he still learning? So that was a big moment for me like a big moment of success and second of all what I told her and this is I think many language Learners can relate I told her that yeah, of course like yeah, we can sit down we can talk. Talk we can we can we can and we can we can we can communicate and blah blah blah, but I still have to stop you sometimes and say hey, can you repeat that or I'll still have to ask you o what does that word mean? And you'll have to use a synonym and then I'll understand it or then or you'll have to explain it and then I'll understand it and she's like, it's not a big deal. I was like what's not a big deal, but I want to get to a point where I almost never have to ask you to explain something.	
3	I almost never have to ask you to repeat something. I almost never have to be like, how do you read that character? Like I want to get to that.	
1	Late fees like oh oh and anyway, what I wanted to point out was a couple things first of all, it's been a five-year Journey for me. In fact, maybe even a little bit more than five years if I'm thinking back, I believe my Mandarin Journey started in September of 2014 if I remember correctly and we are now in event December of 2019.	
3	So when in fact if I'm not mistaken, it's been more than five years now a little bit more.	
1	So it's been a little bit more than five years in order for me to achieve a certain level of comfort with this language and I was reasonably consistent with my studies. There were moments in time where I wasn't studying there might be a three-month stint right in studied and practice vitamin a six-month stint here.	
3	Like there were moments in time where I definitely wasn't practicing and studying but I think it gets made up with the fact that I've done a lot of intensive study. I went to Beijing for three months. I went to Taiwan. Or Taiwan for we think two months. I did a two or three week intensive stint Rose being four to eight hours of Mandarin a day in Calgary. So I was like in online lessons for four to eight hours a day.	
1	So that was something I did. So I've done a lot of intensive study. So I think which makes up for a lot of the lulz where I wasn't doing any kind of study consistently so generally five and a bit years of pretty consistent study. D in order to achieve I would say kind of like a mid B1 level a mid intermediate level which is a very respectable level than in my perspective. It's really to be honest. That's kind of the level that most a lot of language Learners are trying to achieve in their target languages. They don't want to be super super duper fluid like a native speaker.	
3	They just want to have a decent level where they can talk to native speakers. They can hang out they can have some friends. They can talk. They don't it's not a huge mental strain.	
1	And so that's the thing. I want to stress for everybody. Like it will take I've said this a million times. It will take a number of years for most of you in order to achieve that level second of all, I want to point out that in order at least in my experience in order to achieve a reasonably strong level in a language.	
3	I believe you need a mixture of two different types of language learning strategies that are happening simultaneously at the same time.	
1	Number one you're going to need some let's call it more academic style of learning what I mean by that is you're going to need something whether it's a teacher whether it's a study at home program, whether it's like an unofficial teacher. It could be a friend who just helps you out whether it's like a YouTube video series whether you're going to need something that helps you build the foundations in your target language something that helps. Understand at least at a basic level how some of the pronunciation Works how the writing system works how some of the grammar points work how what's the difference between this vocab word and that vocab word like you're going to need something. It doesn't have to be super structured and super traditional or super boring, but you will need something that is slightly more. I'm going to use the word academic something more on the academic or structured side of things to help you build. Build the foundations of the target language and then on top of that you're going to second part of the equation, which is some more casual styles of practice listening to music doing language exchanges traveling abroad getting a boyfriend or girlfriend and dating someone for a bit volunteering somewhere and getting some real hands-on experience could be something like who knows right could be there's a lot of ways could be starting a YouTube channel where you try and talk in the language. Could be who knows something that's more casual something that is more taking place in the real world.	
3	I suppose you could say in my perspective.	
1	I think a healthy balance of the two is a formula for Success at least for me in my experience and based on what I have seen what works for different language Learners. So I want to talk about that. I want to share that piece of advice for you because it's been a big thing that's helped me in Mandarin in French and in Spanish and heck even in Gujarati and every	
3	And every foreign language, I've gone out to learn that has been a massive a huge part of the equation for me, and I think I can work for a lot of you too.	
1	Anyway, this is gone for good 25 minutes. So, I appreciate your attention. You guys are the best and we will talk very very soon. Bye for now. See you.
