It's only a 15-minute lesson and we just break down the present continuous in the present simple. Give you some good explanations give you some good teaching so that you can understand it and use it correctly. So how this test is going to work will do a quick review really really quick review over the material from yesterday and then I'll give you guys an example of how the questions will look and also I want you saying this out loud as you hear me read off the questions, if you think you know the correct answer say it out loud to yourself so that you can practice speaking English on my Facebook page posted a question. How many days a week? Do you practice speaking English? How many days a week? Do you practice speaking English about 60% of the students said one two, three days and about 30-something percent of the students had four to seven. That should be opposite. You should practice speaking English everyday. That doesn't mean you need to sit down for hours if you take 10 minutes a day and just practice speaking it'll do way more for you than you think. Just do a little bit every day and you'll slowly improve your English but a quick review of the present continuous. Remember that Sam is there are plus the verb plus Ing and we use the continuous of things for things happening at or around the time of speaking. So the action is not complete. So we use the present continuous for things happening at or around the time of speaking and the action is not complete. Remember that Sam is there are plus the verb plus ing. Remember the present simple we use the present simple for things in general or things that happen repeatedly so things in general or things that happen repeatedly and you would use I / we / you / they plus the verb with no s or you use he Shear it plus the verb plus s. So, if none of that made sense, make sure you go back and listen to the This lesson so you can understand that and do well on this test, but here's an example of how the test is going to work. There's two different sections in the first section. I'm going to read off a sentence with a verb and I need you to tell me if that verb is in the present continuous form or in the present simple form and also if that's what it needs to be. So here's an example water boils at a hundred degrees Celsius water. Boils at a hundred degrees Celsius. Now you say that out loud water boils at a hundred degrees Southeast Celsius. So what form is that sentence in if it says water boils, that would make it in the present simple. Does it need to be in the present simple water boils at 100 degrees Celsius? Yes, it does because that's just a general statement. That's not something happening right now. You're not saying that the water is boiling right now. You're just saying what? Boils at a hundred degrees Celsius, so that would be the correct way of reading that in the present simple. But here's another example the water boils. Can you turn it off the water boils? Can you turn it off you say that out loud the water boils. Can you turn it off? Would that be correct? It's written in the present simple. But is it does it need to be no, it does not you would need to say the water. Water is boiling. Can you turn it off? Remember it's talking about right now. Can you turn it off? It's not talking about a general statement. It's talking about an action taking place that needs to be completed. The water is boiling. Can you turn it off and the original sentence did not have is in it? But member am is RR plus the verb + ing. The water is boiling. Can you turn it off now? Let's get into this test. Let's have some On and let's see how well you understand the present continuous and present simple. So here's your question look that man tries to open the door of your car. Look that man tries to open the door of your car. Now you say that with me or say it out loud. Look that man tries to open the door of your car. Is that in the proper verb tense? So look it's talking about at that moment the man tries to open the door of your car that would be incorrect. It would need to be in the present continuous. It would need to say look that man is trying to open the door of your car look that man is trying to open the door of your car. So that will need to be in present continuous. U.s. And remember it Sam is there are plus the verb + Ing and that is an action taking place at the moment. So hopefully you got that one right next question. Can you hear those people? What do they talk about? Can you hear those people? What do they talk about? You say that out loud. Can you hear those people? What do they talk about? Out so he they're asking. Can you hear the people at that moment? So how would you need to put how would you need to put that can you hear those people? What do they talk about is do they talk in the right tense? No, it is not that we need to be in the present continuous. So you need to say can you hear those people? What are they talking about? What are they talking? About member present continuous is a misra r plus the verb + ing. So that sentence would read. Can you hear those people? What are they talking about? So I hope you guys are doing good. Let's move on to the next question the moon goes around. The Earth and about 27 days the moon goes around the earth. And about 27 days is the word goes in the proper tense. The moon goes around the Earth in about 27 days. I'll read it one more time. The moon goes around the Earth in about 27 days. That one is in the correct tense remember when you Going about present simple if you're talking about with he she or it you're going to have the verb plus an S. So the verb go right there become goes and it's going to have EAS on it, but it would come goes. Okay, so the moon goes around the Earth in about 27 days. That one would be in the proper tense. So hopefully you guys got that right? So next question. I must go now it gets late. It's gets in the proper tense. I must go now it gets late. I must go now it gets late. That one would not be in the proper tense because remember it's talking about now. So we need to be in the present continuous. So that would read I must go now it is getting late. It's getting late. So I must go now. It's getting late. Hope you guys got that right. Let's do the last question for this section. And there were move on to the second section of the test. Let's read. This one. Paul is never late. He always getting to work on time. Paul is never late. He's always getting to work on time. So so if you did not listen to the previous lesson, this one may be a little difficult because we talked about I always do and I'm always doing so I always do talking about something that you do every time and I'm always doing talks about something that you do more than normal but not every time and this sentence says Paul is never late. So the correct verb tense for this is Paul is never late. He always gets To work on time. It would not be he's always getting to work on time because he says Paul is never late. That means he's always on time every time so that would mean you need the verb not in the ing form, but it's talking about he Shear it so the verb would need to ask on the end of it. So Paul is never late. He always gets to work on time. I know that one was a little tricky, but hopefully you guys At that one correct now for the last section of this test, this is where it's going to help your pronunciation. I want you guys to practice adding ing onto the end the verbs and telling me how they need to be pronounced. So I want you to practice saying verbs with the ing ending remember ing gives that Inge sound Inge. So running walking talking speaking leaving. Okay, Gene onto the end of it. So here's an example. I lost I lost my phone again. Not again. You're always losing your phone. I've always lost always. Yeah, I've lost my phone again. Not again. I would ask you you would say you're always losing your phone. So we'll talk about which verb needs to have an ing on the end of it and I'll let you pronounce it so like that. One I've lost my phone again. What's the verb they're lost? So how would you make that verb in the ing it would be losing so that one's a little different how it works. But let me show you how it works again. So the car has broken down again. What's the verb there? The car has broken down again the verb there is broken. Okay, so you could respond with That car is useless. It's what how would you take broken and put it in the ing form? It comes from the original root word or verb of break. So you would say the car has broken down again and someone would say that car is useless. It's always breaking down work on that pronunciation breaking down and something breaking down like is when the car messes up and doesn't work. So that would be breaking down. The car is always breaking down. Good job. I hope you guys got that one. Right? Let's practice two more verbs with the ing pronunciation of the test and we'll finish up so Look, you've made the same mistake again. Look you've made the same mistake again. What's the verb there? Look you've made the same mistake again the verb there is made. Okay, you've made the same mistake again and made the root verb, that is make. Make made is the past form of make. Okay. So if you make something in the past, it will become made. So the original is make how would you pronounce make with ing? How would you how would that sound? Remember you add that Inge? So it would it be? Oh, no, not again. I'm always making mistakes. I'm always making mistakes. Hope you guys. They're pronouncing that correctly and practice saying this out loud as we're doing it. Oh, no, not again. I'm always making mistakes. So that's how you would do make last one to practice some pronunciation and we'll finish up this English test. So oh I forgotten my glasses again. Oh, I forgotten my glasses again. What's the verb in that sentence Oh, I forgotten my glasses again. N so what is a verb? It's forgotten remember that's in the past tense. So what is the root form of forgotten? It is to forget. So how would you pronounce forget with ing on the end of it? Remember it has that thing sound. So how would you pronounce forget with that ing on the end of it? You could say something like typical. I'm always forgetting my glasses. Call I'm always forgetting my glasses. I hope you guys did well on this test. So we practice how to use present simple and how to use present continuous and gave you guys some examples of saying some words with that e on the end of it practicing adding ing on into the verbs tomorrow. We're going to come out with a new English lesson. We're going to continue the present simple and present continuous but moving to a different section of it and teach you guys something new about it. It and will keep coming out with these lessons every Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and make sure you look out for that English that Facebook live lesson that comes out every Saturday and I'm thinking about doing a Facebook live video Monday through Friday, but I'll let you guys know about that.
