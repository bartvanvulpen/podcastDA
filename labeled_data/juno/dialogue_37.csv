2	Welcome friends to the fact Checker podcast. This is the show where I make my wee little contribution to the low-carb high-fat ketogenic Community as I document my travels on the course of regaining my health as a once was fat trucker.	
4	I know it's been a little minute since my last episode, but I have in my hands.	
2	My latest d-o-t medical physical check. I got a two-year past now. I'll be completely honest with you. I was honestly thinking for about a week before going in there that maybe I should just ease off on the keto going to go ahead and go with a little bit of carbs bump myself out of ketosis because I know that they got the little dipstick thing.	
1	They stick in the urine sample and they check a whole bunch of things. What is it about eight something like that six or eight?	
2	I know that one of those is they're checking for sugar. Make sure you're not a diabetic. I'm good with that and I was certain that one of those was going to check for ketones and your urine after you have sugar in your urine. That's a signal that you're diabetic if you have sugar and ketones in your urine, it's a sign that you're out of control diabetic and you're on death's door and that really is a real thing ketoacidosis is a life-threatening medical condition, but my reasoning for thinking about giving up Kito for a week before going in there is I just didn't want to have to have that discussion.	
4	I didn't want him to dip that thing into my urine and go. Oh you have ketones in your urine you're gonna die and then I'd have to explain it. But then I decided with my wife's help love my wife that you know, what just go for it. And if they make a big deal out of it, you got a podcast with many countries in the world listening not that little old me matters, but You know, maybe I can get the word out there and problems that I had but you know, it was all for nothing nada zilch. Nothing was said about my ketosis.	
2	I don't know if he didn't check it if it wasn't on that little sample dipstick or if he just as long as there's no sugar showing that he knows better and just didn't care.	
4	Either way. There was no mention of it for my devotee physical. I weighed in at 160, which is one pound over there little chart.	
1	Art doctors chart saying that I'm one pound in the overweight region.	
4	Now, of course, that's nothing the whole thing went pretty well and wasn't without an issue. He hooked hooked me up to the little blood pressure machine and it spit out a ridiculous number.	
2	I mean, what was that one had to thank God for a man has 157 over 94. If I remember right on there little blood pressure machine. He looked at me funny and said you don't have high blood pressure day. And I said, No, pretty sure I don't so he shoved a little machine over in the corner. And he said well do this the old-fashioned way.	
4	He wrapped a little thing around my arm and stuck the other thing on my vein and time. He got done he come up with 126 over 74 not too bad. And that's with me having White Coat Syndrome. But in his case, he had a blue coat on but it's still the same thing.	
1	I don't like going to places like that.	
2	This is the first time that that particular location has Has used an electronic filing for the d-o-t medical certification, but I still had a paper trail.	
1	I still had to take my I don't know eight sheets of paper to corporate so they could mail it to the state if it's filed electronically.	
2	Why is it being mailed to the state? Unless it's just a fact that it's hard to teach an Old Government new tricks. That might be it speaking of ketones in a urinalysis sample have to revisit the last So where I talked about Ketone sticks if you're showing week on your Ketone sticks I said, it just means you're fat adapted and you're not letting out as much well got to reassess that because I suddenly went strict got rid of all the artificial sweeteners just for complete transparency.	
1	I do still use Stevia and actually honestly I use quite a bit of stevia and I'm peeing purple on my stick again.	
4	So I don't know I think that's all up in the air and and I still think that they're wrong about saying ketones ticks are useless.	
2	I've been on keto for the better part of what six months and after I got rid of the artificial sweeteners, I'm being purple again dark dark red paint dark, whatever.	
4	I still think he knows sticks are still a valuable tool to have in your Arsenal and a whole lot cheaper than the alternative and I'm cheap and I'm not going with that expensive alternative. I'll keep paying on a little paper sticks. This episode is brought to you by anchor dot.
