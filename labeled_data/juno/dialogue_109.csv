2	Welcome everybody to another episode of bucking stock news podcast powered by two Bulls performance feeds Thor this this episode may be a little different kind of interested talk a little bucking horses.	
1	Yeah, for sure. So our guest today is the owner/operator of Bridwell Pro rodeos Tim Brig. Well, how are you? I'm good.	
2	I'm good. Thanks for having me.	
1	Oh, no worries. It's kind of going to be learning experience for us all.	
2	That will then in the horse deal for a very short time like a short six months.	
1	Is that how long you had them probably?	
2	So yeah, it's my fire got put out real fast.	
1	But anyway, so so you you guys are recent on on the the Bridwell card, correct?	
2	Yeah. So for to give you a little back story I was a Bull rider not a very good one. I wrote both, you know through high school and college and instead started and I guess I bought my Pro card in 96 anyway, and I rode around and got on lot of balls on the west coast. What it what had happened is I do to getting beat up and Andrew and stuff. I kind of had to give it up yum. I was only 25 or 24 when I quit But I threw getting on a lot of bulls out here on the West Coast. I became friends with Don Kish and getting on his balls all the time and go to go into their rodeos when I got beat up real good. The last time I guess 99 there. I he he called me when I was in the hospital and get offered me a job to come out and weld for it. Well, I was beat up and like I said, he beat up enough to where I can. I couldn't do too much like couldn't lift too much or do too much buddy buddy called and we had been like I said friends before need any dawn said would you like to come home and and weld for me? I'm trying to build this feed lots of these bulls. And and all I had to do is set in well, you guys are probably familiar with putting up pipe and cable fins. And and so I just had to set there and weld them the Milliron on the post to run the cable through and so on that that winter I came or well, I got hurt at Fort Worth. So it was about this time of the year anyway, and that came home and welded for dog. Well, anyway, it evolved into going to work for he and John crowning and and I work for the rodeo company therefore started in 99 and started, you know, discontinued helping Dawn with bulls and then really started getting involved with the horse part of it. You know while working for the rodeo company and then No.5 John offered me an opportunity to buy into the company and by the horses from the company which Saudi I did definitely at the time they they provided the horses and Don had two bullets on the ground. Right? Right. That's exactly right. So John own on the horses and then Dawn on the Bulls and then John also on the time of in cattle. I guess. That's anyway. and so through working around there for four or five years there and I started flanking the horses I guess and probably like oh three and then again just got an opportunity there and bought the horses and oh five and and then kind of well, I don't want this to sound wrong. But you know the horse program when I bought it and I'll five it was it was struggling, you know, there was I think there was a couple or three maybe horses going to the final and and and not a real real and I don't want this to come across like I'm saying anything derogatory. I'm not I'm not I'm just kind of trying to lay out the facts the breeding program. For the horses wasn't real organized. You know, there was kind of not sure what calls were out of what two mares. You know, there was some paperwork loss. You know, it's kind of a oh, yeah Club not a real not a real organized situation and not hey and not to say that I don't feel have some hiccups here and there today. I'm just saying, you know five it was in there was a lot of I did all the information wasn't there. But anyway, So then what I did is, you know first thing I did when after buying the horses sorted up the mayor's kind of got the you know, the mayor's that I thought were the best Mayors and certainly as we all know if you raise bucking stock you the ones you think that are the best at the you know, your first year or two into it, maybe they're not the best and and and then the one that you're that you don't breed all the sudden, you know later on you wished you kick yourself in the butt and think gosh. should have been breeding them are you know, she she was at first maybe wasn't the shiniest one in the herd, but you know, they stay hooked and they stay you know, they just stay solid and today that's the one thing I've learned now being, you know, whatever 13 years 14 years into this but one thing I have learned is the ones that are solid and consistent for me the mayor's that do that seem to be the ones that raised the better horses the that they've The Bucks in them. They're just they maybe aren't the most talented but they give it to you every time they might only be in 1819 pointer. But if they do that out of her time, that's probably in my experience that's you know, only 13 14 years into this pretty Limited in the horse industry because you know, you think of them other guys, I was talking about earlier. Oh, yeah, you guys that there's there's like guys like a cork. Oh they've been doing this 50 50 years, you know, so so when I talk about 13 or 14 Teen years. I might my experience is a little bit limited compared to those guys obviously, but in my limited amount of time here going back to what I thought the solemn are the ones that just give it to you what they what they can every time and and do something every time 1819 Point hoppers for me. Those have been the ones that have been the best moms, you know, and I don't know why that is. I wish I had a magic ball to look into and figure out why that is but But you know the the the ones that jump out there and just make your mouth water rank as hell one time. And then the next time maybe aren't as shiny. They the consistency it for whatever reason that that genetic trait of consistency doesn't doesn't carry on to their you know, their Colts have that same enemy. You know what they're just not consistent in any way so that send the Colts out of those.	
1	Distant horses tend to outperform their mothers in the arena. I would word of it out.	
2	I wouldn't say necessarily outperform but the consistent mayor's brain trays you fucker they raised in something, you know, and yes, I have I have some errors that yeah, they're there. I'll give you an example. I had a little old mare 124 her name is classy cat. And so that married be like how she be 18 now, but every cult we've got out of her box there and like to some degree like whether it's shining really in a far potential or dis good, you know, and and in fact, I don't think I have one that's went to the NFR yet, but I got a couple cold. That sure look like they're suspects it just matter of whether they stay healthy and and continue on what they're doing. But but she was probably only I'm in today's world. I would say she'd struggle to be an 18-point her. She was just a hopper. She had cool a cool style. She just wasn't that shiny, you know, and but her cult certainly outperform her that's that's for sure. But at the same time You know, she wasn't very big or was it still have her so she isn't very big and and and just not very talented. You know, it's sort of like a like a football player, you know, if you're not that big and strong it's pretty hard to be very good at it. Yeah, but but he cried but big doesn't doesn't things with her and she's yeah those coats are showing up pretty good, you know, so so in 2005 kind of when you took over the whole deal what What was the stud that you put out and how how to his cult perform? Well the first the first year so okay, so I bought the horses in the fall of o5. And so the actually the mayor's were already bread. So I didn't really make a stud decision until the spring of o6. The spring of o6. I went and I leased a stud and I am so thankful. For that now I went back and I kind of I was kind of a little bit rough earlier when we were talking about how that some of the old-timers are and when I say Old Timers, I mean the the established bucking horse programs. They didn't they weren't really willing to share intellectual property with you and they were pretty pretty quiet and tight-lipped about what they were doing. Well, I was very lucky. I become friends with with the Sankey family and in the spring of oh sick. Exile East a stud from Ike and his name was star belly sneech and so star start at least it was just kind of okay, but he wasn't that good of a boxer himself, but he is Mom was Cindy Lou Who and Cindy Lou Who who was among a really famous mayor. I had that went to the NFR bunch of times and she was a daughter of Custer, huh? I believe I don't have a pedigree chart in front of me, but is if I may Serves me correct correctly Cindy Lou was a it was an own daughter a Custer and and then that sire to Star belly sneech was a stud of cork owes name confused velvet and he was and he was a really good sire. Like they had a lot of luck with that horse. And so anyway, I took start releasing each and brought him to the mayor's like I told you guys earlier that I thought were the best. You know of what we when I had bought from from them guys and when you say that you mean like the best as far as bucking horses are the best that you thought would be the best broodmare type forces. Well a little of both right? So what's the one thing that I did also a little bit different when I first started I knew I was behind the 8-ball little bit and all five or o6 when I first put this done out with the mirror. I know I was behind me. ball as far as in terms of I told you guys earlier that the breeding program that that I bought, you know wasn't real organized completely mined out on what what matters were produced and what stuff for the what and got out of it was just kind of just a bunch of horses really and so what I did is started, you know, but, you know, obviously with bucks who we had all our old mares and boxes and stuff, but then I went to bucking some young mares and and doing some stuff that way and then I started breeding some young mares like some three and four-year-old Billy's to to try and get ahead of the curve and it wasn't that I wanted to turn those those fillies in the broodmares at all. That wasn't my intent. It was just to get a cult out of him to get to get ahead of the game a little bit and and and and I use you know, a couple things, you know to decide number one was obviously Secondly was was the you know the pedigree of the mayor but but again, like I told you that wasn't completely organized. So it was kind of kind of kind of sorts to navigate through that but then the other thing was confirmation, you know, I talked a little bit ago about classic at one of the one her problems was why she couldn't Buck any harder or be any better than she was just for confirmation. She was too small and built a little bit wrong. To be to be really rank, you know are really good. So, you know, you can almost look at a horse and see what how is Styles going to work? You know, how he's going to block? You know, a good example is Butler's you know, Benny Butler you guys are familiar with that and I'm sure everybody knows Benny Butler Rodeo business. Well, they're there the way their horses are bit built their big kind of lanky kind of raw. Bone horse. And they got usually a highway others, you know, and they're they're just built to where you know, they're going to be dropping they're going to Buck hard and they're gonna be dropping and they're athletic they're really built that way and and so that and so in terms or in turn built any does have a lot of stronger horses that will turkana guy and Buck Em Off. Yeah, I mean and but they also can be 90 on them, but they're just they're built that way then on the flip side of that you can go and look at Like Kirby's heard in Utah the Kirby family their horses are a little bit smaller not as high withered little more kind of I don't want to sound say I'm wrong because I don't want to be like I'm down on them because they're awesome horses. They're just kind of like a little fat horses, you know and very little and so because of that because I have some of them to they Hawk they're really the guys because they're little bit. They're not as They're not built to be strong. They're you know, they're really effective and they have cool Styles and they're really flashy but they're not going to they're not going to block anybody off because they're just not built to do it. So yeah, that's that's certainly a big component in the bucking horses deal is is the confirmation, you know, you have obviously the pedigree but the confirmation means a lot that's interesting. So you said that you were namely blessed to get that stud. I mean it was where the first set of Coach really good or how to pan out.	
1	Well, so yeah. No, I mean I'm not going to sit here and say they're the best ever but they were awful good like well one cult in particular I actually sold in the security and I think it was like 2012. Well, it's see I would have been 2012. I sold a horse. Pony man, he belongs to stay Smith now and he was he was out of that cult crop, you know, and then there was you know, he was by far the shiniest one. I mean, I guess I sold him to stay. I'm pretty sure it was 2012. He bought him there at the Benny Binion sailed, you know the bucking horse or a bucking horse security actually stays puts it on and and yeah, so Smith, I'd buck that colt there and Smith. Bought him and I think he's been to the NFR every year since like, oh, well, yeah, he's he was the shiniest one by far and then oh, I have a few other ones that are just really nice horses, you know that route. And so I think that first whole crop, but probably had well I'm going to say I can't I don't recall but I'm gonna say between 15 and 20 Colts to start with and I'm about I have when do you start those horses? I'm sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Wendy's start those horses, you know, how long is it before you start to know if you made the right breeding decision? Oh, well, sometimes a level five years, but for that particular to answer your question directly, the first part of the question was, you know, when do we start a I start dummy are blocking the Colts when they're too and and and I just dummy buckham once when they're to unless they just flat run off if they just flat run off. Then on my block him again, you know and do something a little bit different just but I bought them wants when they're two or twice. Like I said and then same when there's three and then so then when therefore I get people on them, you know, they start with their Riders. So a lot of them a lot of them horses have anywhere from two three, maybe four trips by the time they're four year olds, and then then it's time for a rider and and sometimes you know, they They you know, if you can see that they're pretty sure of their feet and their they have a really controlled style and they're you know, they're when I say a controlled style, you know, like the akkad. I got a pattern and they're like I said their feet are running room and all that's going on good and I feel confident. I'll stay up and not fall down with the guy. So I'll go ahead and put a guy on him with a couple of dummy trips and then and then the other ones, you know, there's those horses that I've Listen, I hate to admit it but there's horses. I've raised it. It took six or eight trips to before I felt confident to put a guy on it because it was all down all of ya and and generally that's the wild or wasn't it and going back to the breeding. That's when they're bred wrong. They're too wild and you know bucking horses. Sometimes the the Layman fan gives bucking horses a bad rap like they're there and I shouldn't that sounds wrong. I got I wish I could I was better with my words, but They get kind of a bad rap like her wild and yeah, you guys know that's that's not the case at all. Some of these some of these horses are really gentle and really good to be around and and and generally speaking is the more quiet they learn calm. They learned Focus. They are the better bucking horses. They are they you know, they don't have to be Wild Buck. We all know that what a maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not a bucking horse guy got on some back in the day and never never did any good at it? Didn't ever understand it but aside from just sighs. How do you how do you choose which which event you want to Buck those horses a cracker or saddle bro? Yes. That's a really good question for me. First of all, you're going to see when you dummy block them kind of what they do with their head. And when I was talking a minute ago about the control their body control while there while they're bucking with just a dummy on that gives you a little bit of an indication of what event to do to put them in. in butt butt For me, I found more of their mother. So if their mother could take the bronc riding and tolerated it and she liked it and bucks in it. The Colts in seems to do that, you know, tools will follow suit now that's not always the case but a lot of the time it is, you know, an in an unfortunately the way as the way the rodeo business is now with the shorts. Age of bareback Riders, sometimes you are forced to put Colts in the bronc riding that you're not 100% sure if it's going to work or not when you're first blocking them around but sometimes there's it works out beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't but for the most part you kind of got a number one go with their style number two kind of their mom and then third the availability of the riders that are there that day you have very many of those horses that you may be starting. In one event and then decide that they need to go to the other event, or maybe they do both events or oh absolutely. So so I have a horse named Capone and he's been in a far five times. I think or maybe six and his mom is out of one of our famous men as Raggedy Ann. Well when I first started bucking Capone, he was a bare back and he went to the finals like for three or four times and bareback, you know in the bareback riding.	
2	Like I said and then	
1	What happened was he kind of started moving out started covering too much ground getting a little bit long and away and then and then we moved him to the bronc ride, you know, heck he never even ever got bucked in the bronc riding until he was probably, you know, seven years old, you know, so we're so eight years old. Maybe I can't I'd have to you know look back but but yeah, no he went to the finals again in the bronc riding. Yeah, actually, yeah, he's been as though you know, he been in the finals. I think he went man.	
2	I wish I could remember I think he went I know he went a couple three times anyway in a bareback riding and then it only went twice in a bronx and the first year he went in the Bronx actually feeling Crawley one second and on him in The Eliminator pin that he wanted second that one round that one night and then then he went last this last night and 18, but he went and teen again, but then it came out that and was Zeke's arson and I think of zika gone anyway, and I didn't even got in flank and they jumped off I think and got to reroute a river. But but he so it came out backwards. And so it was kind of a mess that you're in 17 and then they didn't he didn't go back and this year and 18. He still box really? Well, I'm not I'm I'm not trying to say that, you know, like he's killed us really really hard. He just didn't go last year in you guys know how that goes some years. They need they need more of one kind and another and you know, this is how it goes. He just didn't get chosen last year, but he still as good as he was these this these people I'm going to mention here their long ways from you, but you probably you may you may know this the answer to what I'm going to say to correct me but to go with what you're saying Thor and some good friends of mine that live over there by you the the gays that horse is salt. They he went to the finals of bunching in the bareback riding and I'd never seen him in the bronc Ridin till this year. Did he go in the bronc riding him this year to the final? You know II could look but I don't recall seeing assault there, but I know him he's that Buckskin gilding. You're like, he's a good horse. Yeah, I don't know I could you know what I can look real quick cuz I think I have the NFR left right here in the go in the old. I remember seeing them. They took him to I think it was luck in in in the Bronx grab your maybe Amarillo and I was I had to watch that video a couple of times thinking is that the Assault that I think it is. Yeah, yeah, and and and and he's probably the same the same. Same scenario as I was talking about with Capone, you know, he's been a good bear back for a long time. But if they start covering a little ground and stuff.	
1	Oh, yeah, he went to the end of our here. He is right here on the list.	
2	He and three Bells went from rafter G. But yeah, so yeah sometime later on in life.	
1	They just got it. I started covering too much ground and not doing doing things right. We got to move them and that's just that's that's good night about the bucking horses compared to the Bulls is	
2	You can do things with him to kind of keep him bucking like like that. You know, if the bareback rider they're not showing you what you need to see you. You still got the bronc riding, you know in the bull rule if the Bulls quit, you know, where do you go from there? You know, that is that's something that maybe some people listening. They may not know a difference to in the horse deal you guys Buck your mayor's as well as your studs and galvan's verses in the bull deal. It's only the Bulls. Well, absolutely. Yeah in fact T' are our best horses are mares. I mean, there's good. I guess I could I don't have numbers in front of me. But I would say the biggest percentage of our heard that's of the higher-end horses are the mayor's you know, and you guys can book them heavy bread too, right? Yes. Absolutely. You know, you don't want to Buck him right up to the end. But but like a good example of For a how our system earlier in the conversation I mentioned how I learned a lot from Ike's Anki and one of the things that I learned from Mike was with breeding young mares and then breeding your business. Let's face it guys. It's if you don't breed your best mares, you're not going to have good Colts. You're gonna have mediocre cult. So you gotta break your best married.	
1	Well, so how long does that take them out of the Arena?	
2	Well, so are the way our schedule works is, you know, obviously if Some of the NFR then we don't do anything until the end of March as far as rodeos are concerned. I don't go to Texas or anything like that. I just use a stay home and Buchholz and do that kind of thing for how my program works is I will I turn to start out March 1st. I leave I leave our studs out for 45 days to 60 days depending on you know, how the weather you know, like I If there's like a feel like they've got two good Cycles. in then then that's when I pull them if if I don't feel like that then in I just I anyway I just want to make sure that I get them covered and I try and do it within two months if I miss if the stud Miss isn't there, I just absorb it and I don't worry about it because I don't need Colts too late because again, it could screw your deal, but I messed up my schedule because I booked the mirrors that I breed and and how I do it is so A good example is like wild and blue and tnf are just a couple of months ago or three months ago, whatever it's been now and she had a cult couple days ago some so she you know, so the turnaround time is so she's bucking the pmf are you know, eight and a half nine months bread. But then she'll she you know has these this winter off. She has her Colton case. I live in California. It's pretty nice where we live it's cold right now, but for the most part it's not too bad in the winters. She'll have she'll have, you know have her cult usually and February or 1st of March and then I will only leave the Colts with the mayor's from Fort same deal as the as the breeding cycle 45 to 60 days and then I and I ween them called too young and I A month as much hay as they'd like as much like they have free choice Alfalfa and then I feed them grain and cast Mana to get them going and and it does two things. It gets my mayor back on the road so I can get a rodeo on again. But it also makes you cold it's good to be around and pretty gentle. So, you know, they come they come to feed and and and they get used to being around people. So they're not they're not real wild went for later on and and then they don't get a little go ahead you obviously they get free choice Alfalfa and good feed but you don't have a problem with them growing just like from not being with her mom. Actually we've done it we've done a test because you've had I've had that question happen a lot and I've actually had the cult that Our on on hey and calf man and grain outperform the Colts that are on the mayor still I'll be done. Yeah, and and I think that's because we don't know how much milka mares producing you think, you know, but you don't know how much the calls getting and and so, you know, it's no different than the cow-calf deal the cow-calf guys, you know, you'll have Pals that always bring in a calf at a great wing and wait and then you got not count bring in a calf with a very good weaning weight. So you just can the cow or whatever they do and get a different cow. Well, it's not that way in the Bucking Horse World where you don't just because America doesn't produce good milk. That doesn't mean we don't want to keep raising cold side where we just going to find a different way to take care of that baby and get big and strong because you know, the maternal ability might not be there on that matter, but the Bucks in them, right? So we got to kind of and going back to what we were talking about earlier this Rocking horse deal isn't like the Bulls deal. You know, it's it's a lot harder. I mean that they just they're so there to get a really shiny bucking horse. It takes a lot of lot of breeding and and a lot of luck and a lot of work. We're in the bull deal. I don't I don't want to discredit the bull deal because it's and say that it's easy. I don't mean it like that because it's hard as well because you only get like half your cash crop, but at the same time You can go and and you know breed Mudslinger to a Houdini daughter and you're gonna have a pretty good chance of a cast that box. I mean pretty good chance, you know, sorry.	
1	Do you say someth or oh, I just think I think you're absolutely right, but it's I think it's a lot like the horse deal every day more and more. We're bucking females. And and I think you're right. I think you could breed, you know some Superstar stuff and have a pretty good shot, but I think	
2	So they're pregnant for 11 months 11 days. Wow.	
1	Yeah.	
2	So so you're about a year out usually, you know, if and then and that's if that if you know if the stud gets her right away when you turn him in, you know, so and and you know, it is I don't know so that but I like like I said II usually March 1st is when I turned them studs out and out here in For Nia and it's always generally speaking. It's pretty nice. And and the you know, we don't know how that the sunshine in the weather and the warmth and all those things gets gets gets the mayor cycling better and and then so if everything goes right, usually I can use they start getting those mares breads are the first week or two of March and then that you know that gets me the February babies that I'm after so and then after they have their faults, how long is it until you can put them back on there? Well, so generally speaking Yeah, 45 to 60 days. All we know is cult and put them on.	
1	Like I said the full feed deal then then but in the matter of a couple of weeks to recover to you know, you got they got to dry up and then they and then you gotta kind of exercise going to get them in shape a little bit to you can't you can't just you don't want to just take them in there with you know with a big bag full of milk. They'll be you. Do that to him. You gotta let him dry up. Like I said and get their belly kind of shrunk back into shape and just kind of get them back into shape. And you know, it'd be no different than your saddle horse you if you need to get some work done on your saddle horse. You don't just let him stand out six months and then just go get on pounding back into very good. He'll probably just tie up on you, you know, so so a couple couple more horse questions for we dabble in the	
2	The bull side of things for you guys. How many how many murders do you you guys breed a year?	
1	We usually exposed what we've been doing lately. We used to expose 25 to 30 of them depending on you know, a couple of things just how well I like the young men remember a little bit ago. I talked about exposing young fillies, you know for three four year old Phillies. Well, depending Come on, how many I want to put in those into the system for you get a cold out of so but to answer your question directly. Yeah, 25 to 30 of them. And then generally that means that you'll get you know, they'll they'll be a few measures that don't get bread. So you'll I usually shoot to have 20 calls a year at least 20, you know 22 you'll end up with so if you exposed 30 mares, ideally you'd get 30 calls, but generally speaking you're going to get 25 or 26 right in that area and then and then same same deal as finally read exposed 25 meters. It's more like, you know, you know right around 20 to 21 22 and then there's been years like I Beretta I studied calvary's a couple years ago. Tiger Warrior actually, he's are really really great blocker and really bread well and when we breath tiger Warrior, I put him with 20 mares because that was the deal we made. Made with those guys and heck. I think I only ended up with 13 goals. And that was it that wasn't tiger Warriors fault or anybody's fault. It was just one of those things where that was year was real wet and rainy and and not lost sunshine and the mayor's didn't circled. I'm sorry didn't cycle that well, and and so it wasn't all his fault. It was just one of those things that have Mother Nature. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, I when I talk to our vet around home here, and he said he was having trouble. Even getting like the cut and horses and reining horses in the people in the with the saddle horses around he was trying to having hell getting a the mayor's ovulate for him, you know, so it was just one of those Springs. It was just a tough.	
2	It's crazy. You say that I pray break. Some cows has this winter and my vet when he called them, you know, he dragged him and then afterwards he said, you know, it's funny. We've Craig thousand cows this year and there was they were either shortbread or long bread. But but the way he was saying it was They didn't they weren't breeding in a certain 45-day window from all over the area. You know, dude Mother Nature like you're talking right?	
1	Exactly and I think we can all see that mother nature is more powerful and strong more strong than any of us, you know, you'd allowed and I love hunting and I hunt a lot in the Northwest is if I can and if we have time and you'll see that on certain years when we go elk hunting you'll look in the the cow elk. Have a lot of calves on them and it looks like everything's good. Not the populations good and then the next year, you're like, oh boy. This doesn't look good. I hardly see any cabs and and this and that and I of course there's a there's a whole host of reasons for that. You know, you got the Predators and all that jazz, but then probably some of it is the is the mother. Yeah how well they got bread back by the Bulls, you know, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah a lot of variables that play into it.	
2	So before we switch over to the Bulls, what was It's off the top of your head some horses. You guys have taken to the finals back in when you took over and o5 O 6 2 2 now like some of the famous ones you mean that that we've taken. Yeah.	
1	Okay, so well, probably one of the most famous horses we take in the finals is is sock. Dancer Moulin Rouge sock answer, you know, we've sold this in them in the meantime while I start we started taking him. Think o 506 taught that that period of time and took him to the finals a few times 1 branca the NFR and it's the ear. He the year he won that actually I sold him to stay Smith and that you know, Moulin Rouge was a real famous horse. We took now beaver fever. She went for hacks you went from all five till last year and then we retired her beaver beaver fever with a heck of a good horse for us. And then and then in fact one of her sons went to the finals last year be verb and he went to in a foreigner bronc riding and then all raggedy Anne Capone.	
2	What's the what's the gray mare?	
1	Wild and blue? Yeah. Yeah. She's been every year since so I actually bought her from the guy here and right here outside of town a friend of mine named Chuck Norris. He raised he raised his bucking horses and does some high school college and it's Amateur rodeos and has a brief program himself and and I actually bought two members from him and I'm kind of think that year. I bought those murder. I'm gonna say I think I bought those mares from him and like, oh, wait right in there and and I bought wild and blue who herself, you know bucks bucks. Obviously really? Well, she'd been to the NF are all these years and then there was another mare that came with her and her name was His Indian summer. Well Indian summer, she's just an okay Bronk. But remember when I was talking about that consistency of being really solid she oh one of those kind she's solid. She's like a 1920 pointer every time and she her oldest cult I have is a bronc named Indian burn and I took him we've taken him to the finals the last two years. He went as a four-year-old and five-year-old. So and And I know you're playing with fire taking a four-year-old to the National Finals. But but he's just that good and anyway, so that that purchase worked out pretty good for us by an electric bears from Chuck. So, you know, we got a boy, you know a really good mare that produces Colton and one that bucks really well herself. So yeah, that's about what they sometimes it hits like that. Now I've got other stories I could tell you that didn't hit very good that one did so so kind of transition into the to the Bulls	
2	Side of things you guys I'm taking it you don't you don't raise any you buy crack?	
1	Right? So again, like I told you earlier when I first came around went to work for Dawn Kish and and sure if anybody anybody knows anything about bucking bulls and those who've gone to issues and knows what he did for a lot of years and and So I worked around that outfit for a long time and you know, I learned a lot about bulls. I think I learned a lot about bubbles in it and with around a lot of bowls and a lot of cows and lot of All That Jazz. And there was a time when like in the late 90s when I first went around there and early 2000s when if you wanted really good Bulls you need to raise them. I mean, I think everybody would I think you'd be naive to say that in that period of time you needed to raise the goal is to get the kind you wanted that were that were beyond what everybody else had but as we all know through the last 15 years, it's changed, you know, the You know heck there's there's people showing up to those a BBI events that nobody's ever heard of that just flush the cow and put it with this did that and have a mother and had a really good bull, you know, I mean II am not and when I say really good, but I'm not talking about bushwhacker. I'm just saying they have both it turned back in the gate bucket or you know, 22-point Bull and it's somebody that's not really a bull person. They've just bred that way and and and not to try and get and I don't Mean it like this discredit people like they don't know what they're doing. I'm not saying that what I'm saying is it would be no different than me and going and Bryant buying a cutting horse out of highbrow cat and some fancy mayor, you know, I the Bloods there it's in them. So if you know, if you don't as long as you don't mess him up, you know, the Bulls are available and so forth for through just the supply and demand of the rodeo the kind of bulls we Rodeo with week, you know, you guys all know that we don't need both like, you know Long John rodeo with or frozen or whatever, you know, you don't need those but we just need you know, you just need good Bulls to turn back and guy can be 85 or better on and and and so for us what works when my wife Haley and I started Bridwell pro rodeo, you know and and here a couple of years ago. We just found for us. It was more cost effective just to buy the boats, you know with with raising them and that I just don't have the feed for him don't have enough country out here in California Every Little Bit of Country. I get I have to put the horses on because I can't afford to buy the high-end horses, but I can I can I can buy, you know, I have to raise those but I could I can match around and they're really good Bulls, you know, just for free.	
2	Double amount of money. Yeah, like you said the supply and demand you can you can find there's a lot more people raising bucking bulls and good buffing floors in there is horses and then people damn near want to give them Wolves Away, you know, it seems like well here I'll give you an example and I'm guys I'm not an arrogant guy.	
1	So don't think it'll take a like I'm bragging. I'm just trying to say how it works for us financially and up it to be efficient. I bought a bull at the NFR sell two years ago, but we call him 100x helmets Boot Hill. Well, I guess 3500 for him at the NFR sell two years ago taking him to the National Finals twice and the other day at Sacramento PBR. They are Vieira was 89 on them want to short go on him, you know, and I know that that doesn't always work out like that. I'm not being trying to be naive either that that it always works out like that but like him or the bull jive turkey that they the other Brazilian boy rows are in the short goat Sacramento. I bought Josh Last year at the enough ourselves. I give 6,000 for him. He come from Toby Floyd and and that and he was like $89 88-89 on him a guy can put by a really damn good bull anymore.	
2	Four five six thousand bucks. Well, yeah for that you have to raise that ball.	
1	They had to raise five other ones. That's that's all I'm saying. It doesn't work for us.	
2	I seen some videos. As following your guys's social media and stuff that that jive turkeys. I've been a fan of jive turkey style. I was questioning why he didn't go and finals last year Oh you mean the NFR? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, he did know he did. He did go. Okay. Yeah, he did go.	
1	Yeah, jive turkey went and and then I so we took him and we took who's bad news. He's another bill that came out of that sale.	
2	I had to give a little bit of Jack for him though because there was a couple other guys that like him too, but All that was visible that Jamie was that win long the lot one in Long rounds on right? Yes, sir. Yeah, that's yeah, that's who's bad news. Yeah, and there was a there was a white boy. I think you took or maybe he had been before on the rights kind of move away from them guys a little bit. All right, come out Omaha the big bull. Yeah Omaha.	
1	Yeah.	
2	So the other day, I'm at Sacramento muhittin hip and kind of making shoot forward and had a little bit of a different day that bull usually right there to the right. You like he'll go like a round or two right there to the right in the gate and then he'll jump forward and go back a left generally, but the other day, like I said, he hit he hit his hip and made him shoot forward and then he kind of had a kind of a I don't know. I didn't love these is move before I turn back. But once you turn back then he was fine. But yeah that hit so that will Omaha. I like him. He's a good boy, but he came from a friend of ours up in Oregon a guy named Rusty Gorham raised that boy. So the in their sure proud of them Rusty and Lisa are real proud of that bull. So that's cool. Cool for that deal back here. $3,500 will 10 Bingham was like 93 on them at Kennewick or something. Wasn't he? Right? Yeah. Yeah at Puyallup at the yeah. Yeah, and then his brother Tyler at Spring Road. The only time that Bulls been rode the last couple of years. Other than that the PBR deal, but Tyler Kimball throat. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Hi, you know good good good boy, the 93 I think was a stretch that was quite a bit of points. But but but he's a good-good bull and in back to our point is for for what works for our business and and I'm not saying that works for everybody. But for what we're doing it, it works better for us just to buy the both, you know, so I can see the guys that raise them like the pages I watched. They're Bulls at Sacramento. Watch what they do on the sales. And if not and how they do their their their business and I can see why they do what they do. It works. They block like hell and they sell it for lots of money. So they're doing they do you know what works for them? That's good for exactly. What so what about to you can kind of answer this in the two-part question but like us fraternity guys and stuff what kind of segregate our bulls and stuff and then I take it rodeoing, you know, it's um rodeos may have ample amounts of pain some may not Are they are they just in general population like at your house? And then how many how many trips a year roughly. We you put on a bull? Well, the first the first part of your question is is you nailed it. There's there's a lot there's rodeos have the facility that to split them up pretty good. But then there's a lot of a lot of rodeos at don't have that, you know the kind of facilities. You need to split them up a whole bunch. I'll tell you how I try and make them live. And and you guys being bull guide, you know that there's sometimes you just can't make mixes. There's some mixes that just don't work. They just don't like each other. We know we all know that kind of force them through it and get them to get along but for us how I try and do it as I pay them how they fit on a truck. So in a cattle pot sets of 6 is I got using I got a couple sets of fours or like a set of for a set of three got to be the nose and the back step and then sets Six is on the top, you know the top and the bottom decks. So and then that also fit for the pins that we have in our house, you know, we have pins that are about all half acre lots maybe from half an acre to maybe one acre lot and and that's plenty of room for them.	
1	So they don't make it too muddy or or whatever, you know 7f room doing the first part doing doing it that way to with you guys.	
2	Bye. Bulls you can you can at least find find somewhere where they'll get along and don't just have to put them all together. All right. Yeah. Well and I try not to mix too much with young and old that's the other thing you guys probably the same thing is if he generally when they're young and Too Young or whatever young and old this doesn't work. I try and mix bulls that are kind of in the same kind of age bracket. Not not too much because II If you get too many youngsters In Their Own Zone, you know how many Smart Ones they're all just thousands of goofy. But then at the same time I try and just do it that way. I'm not saying, you know, and I don't know there's there's mixes that you're thinking it's all right. This is a perfect mix or getting along great and then one day the fight breaks out your welcoming six and you know, we all know that that program but So that's how I how I have my set and then the sixes or so, but and then the second part of your question, I already forgot. What were the how many trips you you put on the moles a year? So, you know, we have 20 rodeos and and that includes some bull rides and stuff. So not as we all know not every bull goes to every event but generally when they go they got they get back twice, so probably around, you know, 15 to We find out it's probably early and and but remember our our season doesn't start till the end of March and it's over, you know, probably around middle of October. So we kind of so strip for pretty consecutive. It's not like we you know, you know, it's spread throughout the 12 months. We only Rodeo for about seven months out of the year. And I mean excluding you like the NFR and that kind of thing, you know, but you only take such a hit small. There, you know a handful of them on speaking in terms of the whole herd not just hand out of them, you know, so yeah with with that being said have you I mean being that you know, and I think if I'm not mistaken and maybe it's changed now, but some of the rodeos out there California and stuff they may only have rights or buying buying bulls. Have you figured that some Bulls just can't take that whereas, you know, Omaha and and Boot Hill and bad news they can take That right? Yeah, so I actually most of the bulls that you're right some of the that is one thing I've learned about the bull deal that I I did not know before is I didn't realize how important in this sounds really silly and kind of naive but I didn't realize how important the the deliveries were on on the Bulls until the last few years before I you know, I always kind of treat them like horses are pretty good about you know, they kind of take a scoot out of there and they go pretty straight for a while before they start into their Circle. Usually well with the bulls as we all know if a bull Curtis back right gate, he he's so wired and program to do that right there if the gates in his way or if everything it's hard for him that change it up if they've if they've done it done it very long a good example is is so I have a good buddy in the Northwest and you guys know him and my Quarry he has a bull call Cowabunga and so Years ago we were going Cowabunga is always out of the left and we decided he Mike's bringing the reading and reading rodeos. All right. Well, we might thought well heck we'll try and figure out how to get Cowabunga out of the the right. So we were going to we're going to running through this dry if running through and making turn out of there out of the right. We hiding tailed just dry. Nobody even there now we can it was all we could do to make that simple sucker turnout. Out of there to the right. He just wouldn't get one do it just like is the only thing that has to be spraying or something. I don't know that goofy little pot liquor. We couldn't hardly get him to turn out of that properly and finally, II think what we finally ended up doing is running around running around in and doing it until he finally kind of went out there but it kind of ran down the gate even dry. Anyway, we tried to Buck him and it didn't work and gave her a ride and all that. So going back to my original point the it's if if they've if they've been out of one delivery very long. It it's so programmed in their mind. So for me, it's been hard to switch him. But I just try and change it up when they're young, you know before when I see like when I buy up a little if you know we get to a place is only has rights and and hopefully the Bulls young enough. I see I just start changing them up right away and and make them, you know learn to do it that way now. Obviously, I have some that don't don't don't ever change like jive turkey you were talking about him and Was too a while ago, you know, he's right there to the left. He's never been out of any other delivery and he's really good. So why would I mess with it?	
1	So when there's the rodeos where they only have right hand shoots Well, Jack turkey doesn't go, you know, you know, that's just a way that's got to be, you know, he and I only got a couple bulls that way but you know, he once they get to where they're pretty shiny in there and they're that good you don't really want to mess him up.	
2	Do you are you gonna are you gonna start going to some pbrs and stuff while you're slowly while you're slow time off rodeoing?	
1	Well, I wouldn't say no, but I wouldn't say yes. I mean, let's face it. They're like I said the other day when we went to Sacramento it was it would like that those Bulls Bach like hell, I'm okay. And so and so when when Whenever whenever you put your Bulls up against those guys, it really lets you know, what and for me I eat it's not that it's not something I don't have investors and I don't have partners and you know, that's the only partner I have my wife and she's not very loaded so so happy so we don't for the PBR deals just different. I'm and I enjoy doing it because it's something to do. In the wintertime and and and I and I like Cody Lambert and we like Riley. We do do some other stuff with them at the American and that and their friends and that and and you know, like I said the pages and then you got new guys coming in all the time with there was some new contractors there that are pretty aggressive on putting bowls together. It did you have it's not something it's not something I can compete with, you know by looking at it though.	
2	You heck your bullshit in just fine.	
1	But remember that's one time that one time one event next week after week after week, and maybe they are maybe and I'm sure there's a couple dimples that would do it week after week after week. But but for for us, it's not something that work all the way. I'm gonna completely focus on because we have a lot of rodeos and we have a lot of good committees and a lot of people that we do business with that. We that we enjoy, you know, enjoy as well, you know, and we have to have a good set of both for our rodeos. Not just our horses, you know, we we all those committees at a service that's good throughout good quality throughout that's something that we really pride ourselves in here with our rodeo company is We're not yet. I don't want to ever be just label the horse guy or just a bull guy or a guy that has mediocre rough stock and great time today. We try and be full service. We want the best pickup man. The best bullfighter we can get the best book Bronx bareback and Bulls and and even time to be in cattle. We want to be good at it all. You know that I something that that I wouldn't when we first started this one of the one of the guys that I've Has looked up to that I've always thought had excellent stock throughout was Sammy Andrews Sam. He's always had good bulls and good horses. He wasn't just a bull guy or just a horse guy. It's so and that for me. That's not my want to pride myself in this being a Stockman not just one one one sided because at the end of the day those guys paid their entry fees to they need they deserve a decent shot, you know, so he's so leading into the to the 2019 season.	
2	You got a couple couple points here. Is there any any Young Horses you're going to crack out or many bulls. You just bought your kind of excited about.	
1	Um, well, yeah, so we haven't bought any any Bulls right right this minute that are that are really fancy. I mean, I got some calves that I bought from a guy that from ask from a neighbor that are look really good with the dummy and and have got a couple Rider trips on that look like they might Might be really good but I don't want to brag on them yet because they just pretty green. But what are those who you lines? Sorry. What are they two year olds? And you said they had a couple of ridership for the three year olds their fields? And and then then I have I do have a horse coming on a young horse that I call white-hot. He is a solid white horse and he's actually out of that gray mare we were talking about earlier. While Blue well, I got has only had a couple of Rider trips on him, but he won second at Bob Marriott's dirty rotten buckers bucking horse fraternity last summer he one second. I think it was in the bareback ride. Anyway, he looks pretty good. I think that horse he'll be he'll he'll be 5 this year so he got a little more age on him and then some of them because he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he bucks pretty Dang good and and I saw I think that that'll be a up-and-coming star for us this summer moving forward in and there's a there's a couple of other Colts that are that are coming on. I mentioned that Indian burn in that Indian summer line of horses. There's a little brother to Indian burn coming out and he's a a sista numbers 505. He's just a, you know going to be a four year old black yelling and he box Really good. He didn't even have a name yet. I need to come up with a name for it.	
2	But anyway, yeah, so yeah, so that with rodeos I I don't fight Bulls anymore. But probably one of my fondest rodeos ever been to was Salinas. Oh, yeah. She's in the bullfights are think five five times. But yeah, I that was that's probably the coolest Romeo been through I like the heck out at Rodeo in the history and the Heritage behind	
1	Well, absolutely. Yeah, I did so and that's the thing I and I'm glad you missed that. That's the thing that's different out here that from like the Midwest rodeos or the text rodeos or whatever out here when you know, you'll heal you will be talking to different contractors are committeeman and stuff like that out here on the West Coast like some of our rodeos go three and four hours long and they're like how the hell do you have a rodeo this three or four hours long? Well, it's out here. It's more of a celebration. It's like all days he'll you know, And then and everybody's just hanging around all day and used to call those we used to call those cotton carnivals. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's got me kind of I don't know. It's kind of like a celebration kind of I don't know if it has something to do like talking about Salinas, you know, the the Fiesta Mexican heritage Salinas rodale, you know, and just how the heritage is of it's a celebration more than just a two-hour rodeo in a few know and and you know my life she you know, everybody knows Haley she When she when she moved out moved out here and we started in started, you know going to the Royals but with me and you know, she had been out here a lot before as well, but before that but Morgan involved in the production and stuff like that, it was a it was a kind of a culture shock even for her being someone that did in the rodeo business. So for a lot of years to her dad and stuff and And then you know, they were raised under that Jerome Robby Robinson kind of Steel was it was it go into a building? It's a two-hour show, you know kind of almost like a concert you just went in and blew it out and it's not but they didn't when coming out here on the West Coast. It's like they're the committee's and then the celebration is idea behind it. Is it tell us you can keep him there for four hours at the beers. Can you make more money? So that's kind of a different way of doing it.	
2	Same idea just a different different way, you know, so and that is the rodeos out there freaking me and a buddy. We'll talk another day because some some of the first rodeos were out there and I mean, they're huge like you say keep them there for four hours. Like we're not talking about two or three hundred people talking about five or six seven thousand people.	
1	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hell have you guys been to Pendleton?	
2	I've not that's not one.	
1	I've been to I never get done you've been there. For six hours, but time you get there a little bit early and you watch and they have the Indian relay. They have the Indian relay races and I mean it in a policy say the way when I say your be there for six hours. I mean, it's six hours of fun. But time you go to The Letter Buck room and you go to the when you go to the rodeo starts and they have like I said the Indian relay races The Wild Cow Milking and they Buck, you know, 20 whore 20 bare backs 20 Bronx a bunch of bulls have did they have you know, there's just a whole bunch of Stuff and and and it's awesome. It's just so I guess what a person has to really be cognitive of is that it's not always about this. Like it's there rodeos aren't just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter everybody and every Rodeo has a different, you know different way of marketing their deal and that's what I think is pretty really pretty cool about the West Coast rodeos in particular. Is that whether you're at Salinas with the bullfights and what's going on and the California rodale and then you go to the Pendleton with the with the Native American You know history involved in the Tepee Village and all that all all even over to Joseph Organ, you know where that you know Chief Joseph days. I really felt celebrate the best Perce tribe and all that's going on. It's just a lot a lot of different things that play into how they Market their rodeos and how they do their thing is and each each one's different a little bit but really kind of there's a lot a lot to to see in a lot to check out. It's really cool. I think. So, like I said, it's not there not just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter there. It's there's just each one's a little bit different and I like it.	
2	Thank ya wealth or you got anything.	
1	A question that I wanted to know and I think it's probably going to be different for every Rodeo guy. But what you said you buy most of your Bulls are all of them what you just bought some seen some dummy trips on what are you looking for? I mean, you know, you're not you're not competing with them. It doesn't sound like so what's the few quality traits that you really looking for in a good one? Well well Oh guys look at the air and kick and spin but then for for me that that I guess that's I like speed. I you know might Corey and I always round and round about this because you know, I like I said a little bit ago Mike Corey and I are good buddies and bikes been at Northwest bull man for years and and he's in the break over Bulls. He likes bulls that that break over and old knock your job. You don't hang around you've been hanging around on kiss so long, you got the same flavor. He does with the speed a little bit when they have that intensity and speed all I know I like him to kick. I'm not gonna happen. But you know, but you do look at you do look at this. That X does a lot. You know, there's a lot of guys that even in this day and age they don't care how they read.	
2	They just want to see him but you know, well well, so, how come how come for me that I look at genetic number one is I feel like its genetic if they got a good kinetics there. They have a lot better chance is hanging in there. If if you get them a little tired and burn them out a little bit tinkerability Yeah, if if you freshen them back up, they'll come back for you.	
1	Yeah, the other side of that is is it is when I'm done with them they got value as far as if somebody, you know wants a breeding bull.	
2	I got some sun, you know some some some genetic ability here that I don't have to just take my old bull the sale barn I can taking you know and selling the somebody that's raising them and get some good out of the old boy, you know, so and and have a cross that bridge yet because you know, but I just look for it that way, you know, so do	
1	Have a flavor then that when you were young or when you were riding bulls you like, you know, this was your favorite Bull and you kind of maybe it'll make it a little better deal.	
2	If you happen to buy a bull that was you know, the similar genetic line do you have well, I you know, I it's not so much about when I'm riding bulls as much as you know, like I said, I like the speedballs because I grew up around them. But then for me now I like going back to any Anything that that's related to page blood and that's just because of value, you know, we were talking about jive turkey while ago again, he comes up and Toby Floyd rays that go but he's out of a page bull. I don't know what I that's messing about that. I think yeah. Okay. So whatever that is, I don't know but you bull guys know what he is.	
1	That's that's that's good, you know, and that's I just know that if he's out of a page bull and a good cow. When he's done, somebody probably gonna want him, you know, so Not only was he bred well, but if he has a good career that you know that you could look and Bowl, you know, so that that's kind of what I look at.	
2	That's that's interesting to see to hear that side of it as far as you're looking at the after math because a lot of guys that are providing a breed bullet actually agreed to I mean, they they want to build it's been to the finals and read good and it was going to help that resale value probably quite a bit.	
1	Oh, absolutely, you know performance and you know, what's the three p's Prodigy performance and pedigree? And so that that's you know, that's that's the three the three Deals in the whatever it is the beef business everybody looks at those and I look at it kind of the same way in the in the bucket Bowl deal. You know, you gotta gotta have those ingredients. Obviously. We you can't have Prodigy if you've never read them, but You know, that's the third leg of that if if that you know, somebody does cross that bridge will then and breeds one of them both.
