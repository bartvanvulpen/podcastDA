1	A lot of juice mostly do like food history or some statistics in the first five and then get on the step 6 and okay. So I this pictures are working progress and II didn't put together for decades. I finally have some so as I pass them around as you can see I started off by looking, you know, like a normal-size cute little kid and then very early on as start. To pile on weight and then I and then and then there's pictures and they're a little bit misleading because most of them I look like a normal body size and that's because I didn't let anybody take pictures when I was fat, but it did style start to pile on before I was 30, but and then you'll see how it did and you'll see some relief. Lapse pictures and program and the last comment is I want to so there's the wedding puts your nose looking at it. Yes, you're my has been losing my God. I couldn't even remember him being that over way. But yeah, I Married an overweight person, but he lost he's really been now, you know, he's like, I think it I don't know a lot of times. I don't know how many but he's thin now, he's normal body size and he's finished. Move anymore way and so that he's not one of us either. No, he's not one of us.	
3	So this is not	
1	So anyway, I came into program in 1984 in Southern California and I was 39 years old. And so I'm 73 now and and and my highway was 175 and 120 now.	
3	So that is a 55 pound weight loss.	
1	I realized you know, I mean I was just obsessed with	
3	it says really they don't my mother gave me some of that history and she said like, you know, it was just unusual for a little three-year-old to get so excited about how pretty the appetizers look that you put together for a party, you know, and they had hide them from because they were just so pretty and I was just really excited about food very early on you could see the signs there and in junior high I did I weigh more than others and you know, we were smaller than people are now and So when I was in junior high, you know, if you were 10 pounds or 20 pounds you were really big today. That's nothing, you know, and I went to camp overnight camp a friend had diet pills. I had my first diet pills when I was about 7th grade age and I really liked them.	
1	They gave me a lot of energy. They took away a lot of desire to eat and and I lost weight for the first time. I just sort of you know dieted through high school and kept the weight off and then to college.	
3	I definitely I got back into the diet pills and I was more or less addicted to them from the time that I was about 17 to about 31 years old. I took two a day. I had to the kind of the doctors prescribe the very dangerous illegal kinds now I think but you could get them then and there. That plus I was a smoker and that plus, you know, I was still young with a pretty good metabolism sort of manage things until I was 30 years old. I didn't exercise. I never exercise but I did the diet pills. I didn't take them when I felt like I just could not stand it that day. I had a binge and so the obsession was always there. I I was a Binger and a Dieter and	
1	You know and finally around 30 years old. I quit smoking and I had to go off the diet pills. They were hurting my health and I quit smoking and and the metabolism changes, you know, and then the weight started to piyo on and couldn't keep it down to just maybe 20 pounds overweight and you know, it went often and it went to You know, it's much higher so that you can see the signs of it there. And then there's a note in there. You don't see the highest weight. Unfortunately, I regret that now but I didn't let anybody take pictures of me at that point. You'll see me at 155 that picture there where I was a bridesmaid and and you don't see the next 20 pounds on when I hit my highway Brown 55 pounds over what I am now, you don't see that because I had money but I think there were a few and I rip them off and I really regret that my fiber so so now let me know when I 5 to 0 that would mean of 10 and then after 10, let me know please and then I'll know where to go. So just finish that up I so I just it just got out of hand and then find the I you know, I tried everything lots of different methods and nothing worked and I stood I've been judged I was obsessed with food.	
3	I I was always thinking about it, even if I was dieting and finally I discovered oh, ah when I was 39	
1	Okay, so step six. I did make some notes so I could stay focused here on step six and seven six is were entirely ready to have an ad says God and I substitute for me higher power remove these defects of character and I hi.	
3	I just use the term higher power instead of God. So, okay, so and the word defects It doesn't bother me.	
1	I just think of them as like old habits, you know, we're self-destructive and they don't serve me anymore and or at the think of the word liabilities, but and or we can adjust exchange those defects. If you don't mind the word for assets, you know, so that's sort of the way I think of it and and then I was thinking about this. How do you know when you're ready? You know, it says Entirely ready. So how do you know when you're ready?	
3	Well for me, I think it was because they were causing me pain. There were a lot of them. I enjoy you know, and and and you know for dysfunctional reasons, whatever I enjoyed them, you know, like anger their anger to me when I got angry.	
1	I felt you know, like very passionate and I felt and I felt	
3	Felt like powerful and I thought it may be important because you know, I was angry so of course I felt important.	
1	So of course there's going to it's going to do something for me, but you know,	
3	And drama was a similar to that the drama was exciting and the drama kept life from being boring. But what happened was when I got into recovery, you know, I got a taste of what it's like to live a simpler life, you know, and and and not having the anger and not having the the drama it's a lot simpler and it's a lot easier and I actually like that and then	
1	Things just became more and more painful and I had a lower tolerance for pain evidently when I was dysfunctional and everything before recovery. I had a high tolerance for pain, you know, there was a part of me that like being miserable evidently because I would put myself into that state, you know, I was I like playing the victim and I did that with a lot of boyfriends, you know and went along with blame.	
3	I blamed them and they hurt me and I was crushed and therefore I just sort of powdered or salt or whatever and went into this victim role and it wasn't part of it enjoyed being miserable. I can't believe it.	
1	But you know and a part of me that just wasn't ready to didn't want to be happy. I you know, I mean, but when you get into the recovery when I got into recovery, I	
3	I learned to see my part first of all, so I stopped blaming and I could see my part and where I was wrong. So I didn't have all that anger. And then like I said, I just lost the tolerance for it. I couldn't stand it anymore. And I really wanted to be happy. So I'm in pain now when using those Character defects, you know, adopting the anger mode or the victim role. I got a hit. Too much pain. So that's when I was ready. I'm not going to be ready when I'm still enjoying it. I'm not going to be ready if I'm not pay so that that was that for me to be ready. So I wanted to say about another character defect jealousy. I always was, you know jealous in the sense of not so much what people had but I wanted I I was jealous at somebody like somebody else better than me and and that I can see I just I don't know I mean sometimes To replace with something else, but I guess the thing that replace that was gratitude, you know, and maybe if I was jealous of what someone had or someone was doing or this or that or maybe they didn't have you know a problem I had I gratitude was something I adopted in program never occurred to me before I was at the negativity that was another character defect very negative, you know, and that went along with anger and everything else. So I Gaston the negative and but you know turning it around and program they teach us to have an attitude of gratitude. So so I am in that most of the time, you know, thinking I'm grateful and I'm thinking it could be worse, you know, I mean instead of being jealous of somebody else doesn't you don't have to do something I had to do it. I think well, you know, this could be worse and stuff. So I guess I replaced it with gratitude. I was a very stubborn person very stubborn and then I learned the Serenity Prayer, you know, and you're not supposed to be stubborn about things that you can control. I mean there's the other side of it where you you know, you're supposed to do. Give up on the things that can't be you know that you can't control and I didn't I mean how ridiculous is that but that's was my stubbornness. I turned it around for perseverance. I mean if stubborn person is also a person who perseveres only for the right things instead of the wrong things. So learning the Serenity Prayer. I I don't try to force things that can be forced, but I certainly have I've always liked you courage. I've never I never had the character defect of fear. I've always had a lot of Courage but I use that perseverance now for the things that I can change not for the things that I can't change and I was always very possessive and controlling another character defect and that one eye that was a friends and that went along with, you know, wanting to everybody to like me more than the other person. I mean, I was possessive and controlling of the up the friends always and that one. I really remember making the most gains through sponses because early on I tried that Response is it came natural? That was I tried it and you know, the reason why that finally brought me discomfort or pain or fear or whatever because I was going to lose them and there were some that I really liked and I didn't want to lose, you know, and and I had a taste their of being respected and valued and loved but at the same time they let me know that you know if I was You know, they didn't say you're you know controlling but you know like but that's what I was being because I wanted to do what I wanted them to do. So I learn to detach, you know, I would give my views my advice whatever you want to call it. But then detach if they didn't do it I didn't do it and and I stayed out of areas I should stay out of so Tru sponsoring. I learned how you know not to be as control it. With these people as I have and resentment was a big one. What that meant was a huge one of my father and that one is shaped my life on my list for until I got into program. My father my parents were divorced when I was nine, but he you know, he stopped also being a father that that was you know, he moved.	
1	But anyway, he did go to visit him and then more or less.	
3	I was 17. He said you really you know, he sent me back early and they lived in another state and he remarried and then his wife wasn't really comfortable with his kids and he sent me back early from my visit more or less didn't want to see me anymore. So I was deserted by my father. So at 17 and that resentment, I mean that shaped my life. I chose men that were like him and I and the even after I got married to a good man when I was 42, I met him when I was 41, we got married asked for a to so I'd work through all that getting you know, not the bad man, but marrying a good man, but even then I still resented my father and I mean I every time and the reasons not just deserted me are not just you know, a did what he did, but then what really pissed me off was that he didn't hear it a lot of money five more.	
1	And see I got two timers not one. They must know that I need two of them. Don't know I just Just so he inherited a lot of money from his parents when they died. I was never going to see that money.	
3	So now I was really angry and resentful and everything and then I had a really work on that in the program and I really worked hard with my sponsor on that and and that was a character defect because I was magical thinking this resentment.	
1	I enjoyed it.	
3	I wasn't going to let it go and I didn't want to let it go like you're supposed to want to let it go because it's bringing you pain. No, I enjoyed it. It was necessary because I that magical thinking this would hurt him.	
1	I was getting back at him.	
3	I wasn't going to let him off the hook, but that's so magical thinking because I mean, he's in Florida. I'm not seeing I mean he has no idea of who I am or where I am or what I've become so that's just hurting me, you know, and I had to actually learn that, you know, I this common-sense things didn't come to me before program. And so I learned that in program and that it was He's only hurting me and then so I became willing to let that go. You just had to become willing and then I put me in a place where I could do some more understanding and I learned more about him. I went to Stanford for a program. So some years back for OCD and I I inherited that from him. Genetically, but my and I read a book about it and I had a mildly compared to him. I didn't know what he had. I thought he was just playing nuts, you know, the things he used to do but then I didn't know what it was and I read about it in this book and he had a very severe case of OCD and he must have thought he was crazy and I realize how hard it must have been to be him. I learned about his mother who was horrible and I learned more about about her from my mother and I you know, I might have even known these things but you don't think about them your and you don't want to think about anything that would let him off the hook. I didn't want to so now I love myself to think about these things and I totally felt sorry for him, you know, knowing the mother he had the wonder he was the way he was, you know, he couldn't do any better. He really couldn't you know, was he a good father to they love me now, but you know, but I wasn't angry. At it anymore and I because I understood and I not only forgave him but I felt sorry for him and I just don't have any of that feeling anymore. It's just totally gone. So yeah, so that that character defect of resentment toward him with was gone and you can't do this on your own, you know, you can't just wait for God or your higher power or what? Whatever to remove them you must take action. It says in our book and I took action just sort of by, you know, going to meetings listening to people and learning that you could act as if you know, if you didn't, you know, if you were kind of as I was a selfish person with my husband and then I've learned to add deserve. What would a loving person do? Okay could figure that out a loving person would do this. It wasn't my nature, but I could do it just act. So I learned that I listen to people work with a sponsor. You cannot do this program without sponsor. We all know that and and and then I wrote about it things I read about it. I just used all the tools and that's that's the action and and then the great thing about a sponsor is if you get to have one long enough, I've had the same sponsor for 20 years and she sees the progress my mother used to offset my mother, of course.	
1	New me longer than anyone and she would notice Sherry, you know, you just you don't do that anymore.	
3	And so that was lovely and then my sponsor does it for me too because I might not see the things I still will get angry and lash out and I think oh my gosh, so same way am I supposed to draw?	
1	No, that was nothing. Yeah wasn't my finest moment, you know, but but it was nothing too.	
3	What I would do and and that's a good thing about people that I've known you a long time. They could remind you of that and I'm going to talk to Ed left. three seconds
