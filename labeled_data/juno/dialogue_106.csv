1	How excessive movement is burning you out and making it really hard to sustain the results that you do want to achieve in your life guys this morning. I want to talk to you about excessive movement. And this is not just physical movement. This is mental movement and physical. So I'm going to be talking about efficiency in everything that we do and I can tell you now that all of you listening to this will fall prey to this in certain. Of your life. And so this is going to be a really important episode in terms of if you have got to a goal before but it required so much grunt that you couldn't maintain it. And or you can just never seem to get their a big big part of it as it is excessive movement. Now what I mean by this, let me give you a couple of analogies first so you can kind of understand where I'm coming from regarding this and this is going to be the first analogy something that I think we can all relate. Late to because predominately all of us will drive vehicles cars. And so think of when you first began practicing driving a car, right you first got in and it was all foreign to you and you would you would obsessively check the mirrors you would adjust everything the seat the mirrors the steering wheel and as you were going along you're pretty much like white-knuckling, even though you're going under the speed limit you're gripping it really tightly. There's excessive tension in your hands your eyes. As a tracking the mirrors, it's more than normal and you are going through these mental checklist. So when you were driving that are excessive so you are nervous and because it seems foreign to you you are overanalyzing and you were over scrutinizing and your over putting energetic over energetics into everything that you are doing and think about how tiring that is. I I remember for example when I was younger and I was be going on my driving tests with the instructors how tired I would be after the test. And this is just driving for 30 45 60 minutes because there was so much excessive energy invested in mental and/or physical movement and now think about how seemingly effortless driving a car is for you so you will be going along a lot of the That you were doing our and your subconscious mind, you won't even remember much of the trip on the way to a destination a lot of the time and everything just feels instinctual that you can touch the steering wheel and as you put your feet on the brake pedals and the accelerator, you can almost feel the road you almost merge and the car becomes an extension of you and you can apply this to people who play sports for example people who in martial arts. It's you can see a beginner who uses a lot of excessive movement. Whereas a black belt and expert they find in their limb innate so much excessive movements. So everything is very very economical and fluid and you can see that with boxing and you can see it with even speaking on video or public speaking people who are beginners or they're more nervous. They add in a lot of filler words they say, um, but hmm well, And they just keep adding in filler word after filler word after filler word because they are uncomfortable and there is a lot of mental tension there. So with that metal mental excessiveness manifests itself physically and so you can see this uneconomical approach in the way that people speak for example, and even another example might be in the gym when you're looking at people who do I'm just thinking of it and movement that Everyone kind of knows and isn't overly complex as like a bicep curl. So some people when they're doing a bicep curl, they'll be swinging with their back this shoulders and elbows are moving. Everything is moving and not in isolation creating a proper tension on the bicep and that excess of movement actually blocks them from the result. They can be doing bicep curls all Deva because everything is moving and there's some success of physical movement. They're not actually Placing the proper tension on the bicep and because of that they're not going to get the result they want even though they think they're putting in the work. This is a very important analogy to understand because if you are not getting the result that you want or you've got the result before but it was so hard to maintain its because you have so many things that you need to refine and remove now one of the biggest things that a lot of you guys probably know about me is that I'm all about addition. So like I talk when it comes to for example getting into a vegan diet and lifestyle. I'm like add things in add in the smoothies add in the plant-based proteins add in this ad in that that is great. And but paradoxically you cannot always add in a lot of new things. If you don't start removing the excess fluff the excess baggage in your head the excess baggage in your life. Physically in your environment, there's no room for new stuff and that's when people say well I don't have time or I just don't have the energy or whatever it is. You know, you hear these stories of these excuses so much about I don't have time when in actuality what they're really saying is I don't have the capacity or the awareness or the desire to remove enough of the excessive fluff. The excess of movement whether it's mental physical in my life to actually make room for new stuff. And so usually what you'll see is that the excessive movement is in the form of watching Netflix Us in the form of gambling or drinking or procrastinating or just binge eating or all these other things that they find some emotional release in and what it does. Is it prevents them from adding in the good things in their life. And so I see this so much just across the board with people when it comes to them starting anything new one of the biggest reasons why people have so much fear and apprehension around the unknown with in achieving any goal or dream that they have is because they have so much mental fluff going on they play mental ping-pong with themselves and all that internal movement and their head manifests itself. And the to form of feeling tired feeling low energy. Can you think of someone and maybe this is you wear your up in your head so much and you're going back and forward with so much mental movement that you literally make yourself tired. Physically that is a classic example of how your internal state drives your physical world. One of the things that I've practiced in my life, and I think I've become quite proficient. A net is minimizing movement as much as possible in terms of the actions that I take and the steps and habits that I form to get to a certain result. If you see me do anything it's almost like clinical. It's ahead this very sort of Navy SEAL SWAT team approach to things when it's coming to getting things done. So when I'm in the store, for example, and I have the list of things that I want, I know exactly what I need to get I get in there I get those things and I leave I don't go down all the different aisles and play mental table tennis with myself about things that I want to get additional. I don't do any of that when it comes to sharing a message. I'm very clear with the words that I use when it comes to sharing like a doing a video with for my clients where I'm expressing things that I need to do. I don't pad it out and I don't go well and the video is not 20 minutes long of me just going well. It's to the point I say what I've got to say. I'm in and I'm out. It's the same with even just washing the simple things like washing dinner dishes and making dinner. I rinse the dishes off. I stick them in the dishwasher and I run the dishwasher every evening through the night. So in the morning is ready to clean. I've seen some people in our family and they spend 10 minutes washing a plate and I'm like that's 10 minutes of your life that you've spent washing a plate that I could have rinsed in 10 seconds put in the dishwasher unloaded the next morning at 5 seconds and be be done that is mental baggage and it's mental fluff presenting itself as physical fluff the more you can reduce that in all areas of your life. You will massively free up time to grow and Achieve and have more room to do the things that you know you need to do and so another example of This is I don't answer calls on my phone unless they're scheduled calls. Like if someone just calls me out of the blue and it's a client or it's someone who wants to know about our programming and stuff. I don't don't answer the call. They can leave a voicemail and I will reply to them via text message or email when I have that time scheduled. I'm not going to flex my boundaries for people who just want me to be reactive based on their mental fluff. You see what I'm saying? Here is that I protect my space and my let my absence of mental fluff ferociously because other people will try and impose that on you and then you will get dragged into excessive movement. And what will happen is you will have things planned for the day that will supposedly going to get you a head but then you it will be padded out with everyone else's excessive movement and fluff and all these fires that they I want you to put out and you will never ever get to the things that truly matter. So you have to be tenacious about protecting your space. It's the same reason why I don't always check my my messages on social media. I will time block when I actually checked those things and I've had people before message me again after the fact saying hey like why haven't you responded yet? And I come in and I'm like I will respond to you in my own time, and if you can't Appreciate that and respect that this conversation is over and I have no problem with being that blunt and direct with people now because people will impose their fluff and their excessive noise on YouTube and they don't even realize it we live in such a world of excessive movement in everything that we do that people don't even realize that it's not normal anymore. They just don't even see it. And so You can see this excessive movement in the form of anxiety. For example, think of someone who's anxious they pace around they fidget more everything they do is fidgety. They breathe faster. They walk faster this this smaller strides between their steps everything is excessive and then you can go to the other end and even people who might feel depressed who move slowly you the part of that reason is because there's so much internal oil excessiveness. So there's excess of thinking there's excessive ruminating the success of procrastinating this excessive eating this excessive watching of Netflix or there's excessive sleeping and all these other things that then present themselves in the form of burnout and feeling lethargic physically the biggest and most important thing that you can do is anything that you want to become skilled in. Efficient in you need to repeat it. And each time you repeat it. You need to look at areas in that process where you can start refining it more and more and more. And so the only way that you're going to actually be able to refine things and remove stuff is by actually doing the positive habits repeatedly, it's like you won't get better at speaking and communicating. Will you actually start to speak and communicate more? And so you won't get better at removing filler words until you start practicing speaking more the more natural it becomes to you the more you won't have to put those filler words in to pack out your sentences. It's the same with anything. It's the same with driving you you're an example of this because many of you who are listening to this will probably be quite skilled or at least driving as come subconsciously to you. So it's an example of repetition you need to repeat those positive habits in all areas of your life. Otherwise, you will always have excessive mental noise. So that is my message to you today. Most people are all up in their heads. They are playing mental table tennis with themselves. And one of the biggest reasons when someone comes to me and they say hey, I really want you know, I love that idea of getting that result that you talked about. Out but I just don't have the time or someone said well, I got the result but it was really hard to maintain. They they think that the result itself was hard to maintain and it's not even that it's them their processes and they're in efficiencies and the excessive mental fluff and the excessive physical fluff that they did in order to achieve that result was too much. It was too labor-intensive. And that's why they couldn't maintain a result of someone gets in really good shape and then they relapse one of the fundamental reasons why is because they never actually removed a lot of the excess of mental chatter and fluff and distractions in their life and they forced the result which you can force a result for a short period of time, but eventually your natural tendencies will come to the surface and that is what relapse looks like when an actuality. The people that you see breakthrough it's because they removed those additional pieces of fluff. They stop watching Netflix so much. They could actually meal prep this stuff on time. They got to the gym earlier in the morning and they were more consistent with their because they prep their gym stuff the night before they started to have more traction on social media or sharing their message because they did more videos and they moved into that resistance even though it felt really unnatural and awkward. First is so many things that are going to require you to become more efficient. Otherwise, you will always struggle to get the result. That's why you just feel that mental burn out all the time. It's that friction the more chatter in the more excessive movements that you have the more energy expenditure. You have you think about anything that is Is masterful it almost looks poetic. It's almost looks like art form like whether it's painting or music. It's this it they've removed every single excessive piece of movement from the equation to the point that it just looks like poetry write anything in your life can be like that. And right now if you are moving around in your head and you're moving around physically to a point where you're just hitting burn out, you know, To start trimming away all the excess of conversations with people that don't inspire you and don't bring you up. You need to stop engaging and Mindless debating on social media. You need to stop just responding to people's emails and calls just because they want you to in the moment. You need to stop entertaining weak bullshit excuses in your head as to why you can't achieve your dreams and and stop procrastinating on things recognizing that you're never going to become masterful at something until you actually start doing that thing and You do it repeatedly over and over and over and over again, my friend. So that is the message for you today. If you are struggling and you are feeling mentally burn out, it's because you have excessive movement. There is massive areas in your life where you can trim that away but the decision is ultimately yours. A lot of people won't trim it away because they're scared. They want to conform to society. They're looking for people's approval. Cetera Etc. If you want a different life than you have to operate at a different level than most people.
