2	Yo, what up, we are back with another episode of you can't guard me.	
1	It's been a busy like really busy month and a half new home preparing to have you know kid coming in.	
2	I'm excited. It's a boy. It's a baby boy. We pretty much settled on the name. I'll tell you guys about the	
1	Later on, maybe on the Pod maybe on Twitter. Oh, yeah.	
2	We'll see. If if you guys been paying attention at think most of you know what the name is going to be.	
1	I don't know it's not going to be Anthony. That's for sure.	
2	She wanted it to be Anthony kind of with the baby to have its own identity.	
1	And I think that's going to be the best route. I also wanted to name where I wanted to be.	
2	Somewhat unique but at the same time at the same time, I didn't want it to be where like you can tell like oh is baby black because it may be why like, we don't know like I wanted to be one of those days where you don't know until you like show up. So yeah, I'm going to jump right into it man not going to waste you guys time few things. When it comes to myself when it comes to me personally at times I'm a bit arrogant as you guys know, but you know big cocky with my knowledge.	
1	I think I know everything but at the same time I come out and I apologize when when I was in the wrong and maybe at the expense of someone else.	
2	I forget when this was man, but Like a year ago like a year or so ago. I was tweeting with this guy. I'm pretty sure his name is Ian on Twitter.	
1	It's not I am either it's like he IA n i was tweeting with Ian and he was like, hey, you should watch some of these video game guys, and you know, I know me being	
2	My snarky self.	
1	I was like, I'm not going to watch people play video games and he said well you should do it you could do this and that that I repeated pretty much the same exact thing and I'm here to apologize to him.	
2	Here to apologize to him because that's like one of my favorite things to do. I watch I watch mutual funds and I watch stocks all like - he I'm like sitting here on my phone looking at them, but I pay attention to nothing more than mutual funds and stocks pretty much all day and	
1	I tweet quite a bit. But at the same time I'm a busy busy. Dude may not come off like that. But like I don't really have a big circle of friends.	
2	I don't really talk to a bunch of people. So like, you know, I'm very meticulous about how I go about my day. I have about three or four meetings per day outside of that.	
1	I'm looking at the market seeing what's	
2	What's going on looking at Trends legislation looking at that seeing what you know, what different things are impacted just by if Trump says something whether good or bad positive negative.	
1	That's really not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in how that's going to impact certain Market movements. So in case someone calls me said hey what's going on?	
2	I'm pretty much well versed with.	
1	What's happening outside of that I go on like I'm not I'm not a huge car guy. But I love going on to AutoTrader.	
2	Maybe like once a day. It's like this weird thing where I'm looking at cars looking at SUVs looking looking at what's going for what looking at what's coming out and doing 2020 and what's coming out cool and you know all that stuff.	
1	So I'm doing that when it comes to TV mean. It's a really chill. I'm right now like there's not there's not, you know sport mean there's baseball, but I'm sorry, that's just not my thing. Well playing it love the playing it terms of watching it.	
2	No, I'm I'm good on that World Series is pretty cool because you know tensions are super high, but you know, I get nothing out of a regular season MLB so when it comes to TV like You know Netflix big SpongeBob guy loves South Park, but when I get home I go right to YouTube and I watch Nick marks.	
1	He's a beast I watch. This guy named Eller, he rages like a crazy person like he'll die. It is all his fault, but he'll go nuts and start breaking things.	
2	He's hilarious.	
1	I'll watch Nick 8:30.	
2	He's a cornball but he's really really good. I'll watch cash nasty only when he's only when he is reviewing. Something that Sky name flight does like this guy named flight. He's pretty good on 2K, but terrible bass basketball player in real life and this guy will go out and play other YouTubers and one-on-one and he would lose almost every time and so I just want to apologize to Ian for that. I took what three four minutes for that apology, but Yeah, I do apologize to you because I'm doing exactly what you said to do more social more. So for the entertainment Factor less about you know, getting better. But but yeah, one of my favorite hobbies now is to go on my computer do some work and then the background. I'll be checking out Nick a 30 or I'll be checking out mercs or I'll be checking out deller and what those guys are doing because it's just pure entertainment and hilariousness. So apologies to you. Okay moving on going to get right into it. We're going to go over a few things here. We're going to go over Michigan and Michigan schedule then we're going to go over the Big 10 East of Big Ten West and why you know how It got so lopsided and why is it in the way it is so we're going to go through each game here. So we got Michigan verse Middle Tennessee State and what we have here is probably going to be a blue out. So I'm gonna just chalk it up as a win Army. A lot of people are worried about Army. I don't know why they're not going to sneak up on, Michigan. All right. if they're not going to	
1	Big struggle bun Oklahoma, they have struggled in two games prior. So I think Oklahoma was kind of sleeping coming into that game. I think, you know the secrets out so I don't really see that happening.	
2	I got that as a win and I'm not really worried about anything with them at Wisconsin is going to be an interesting game because just like last year was a huge game for Michigan to come back and you know beat Wisconsin do to them losing to them the previous year pretty much the same thing is going to happen with Wisconsin this coming year. I mean they have this game circled. It's the third game of the year. They have a circle. They just took an L last year and embarrassing fashion. It was a freaking blowout. It was a part of the revenge tour. I'm pretty sure that they have that	
1	Have that picture of the Grim Reaper knocking at the door. These are college kids.	
2	They take that stuff to heart and I think that's going to be the same thing for Penn State to and a few games, you know, those will be huge those going to be huge huge games where you know mission is going to have to really play very very well in order to escape some of those games just from the emotion and the focus that those teams are going to put in no, In what happened the previous year? I still think they end up winning that game. Next up is Rutgers when because they're trash next up is, Iowa, Iowa. Michigan man, so I don't think they played last year, but the last time the Last time they played Iowa. I'm sort of research this prior, but I'm pretty sure pretty sure the last time that they played Iowa was that in 2016 when when we totally blew that game if it is, I mean, I mean we owe them a wheel them a whooping. Cuz that destroyed that destroyed our season destroyed.	
1	I honestly believe I honestly believe if we win that game and then we lose to we lose to Ohio State the way we lost like overtime last play of the game super close game. I'm like don't we when would we have gone to Big tents?	
2	I think we would have please comment after this to correct me, but we could have gone to Big Ten's and then we win that game versus whoever was when the matter because they would he got smacked then we probably go to the cfp kills kills like 98% of the jokes out there.	
1	That should be a win.	
2	Illinois the Brandon Peters game that should be a win Illinois is not going to be very good this year. Pretty much Wes truckers Penn State at Penn State another team another team who pretty much got embarrassed last year who's probably looking for blood at this point in time. Go Franklin, a lot of people saying hey, you know, he's you know, who do they have at quarterback and they don't have a court like their quarterback left for a reason.	
1	Like don't look at it as the next quarterback transferred out. They don't have anybody look at it as well. They're nice quarterback was so shook.	
2	That he decided you know what I'm not going to play that much this coming year. Let me go somewhere else. I'm not going to play at all. I'm not going to be the first string guy. So look at it more like that the way that Penn State recruits. They recruit on a very high level. They got guys trust they have guys they recruit not as good as Michigan, but they're right there. They are right there maybe.	
1	Like maybe me like they're on the same tier in terms of recruiting.	
2	So just like Michigan has guys so does Penn State I have that as a loss. Lost to go Franklin. It's going to be a night game.	
1	I know that there's like they're like 7 and 6 are like 500 and night games but end of the day. I just think that that's gonna be a tough one to come out of and then you we have Notre Dame that following week.	
2	I think Michigan regroups and that's going to be a win at home. They go to Maryland.	
1	I'll talk about this later.	
2	Pizza's ready? I'll talk about this later, but Marilyn recruits, okay, but I also see that as a win. Mr. Stayed at home.	
1	We play them much later than we usually do.	
2	Usually we play em in like October or late September. We got him in November this year.	
1	It's funny. I was talking to a Michigan State fan earlier today and he was he was saying how he never knows how good or bad.	
2	His team is going to be coming up and that's pretty much my sentiment and and I'm pretty sure he pays attention a lot more than I do and I could also add on to that. I mean they're you know, you never know how good or bad they are.	
1	Even at the end of the year.	
2	They're usually never as bad as their record indicates there.	
1	Also, you know, sometimes net not as good as	
2	The record indicates I've said plenty of times in 2015. They won 12 games cook.	
1	They were like 12 and 2 they were you know, they were like a play away from being a seven and five team that year it just like there are three and nine season. I mean they got you know, they've just tumbled down words all the way where they have three and nine caliber team.	
2	No not even close. Not even close. So Michigan state is always an anomaly. They always play clothes.	
1	They're going to have a very good defense coming back. Probably, you know, probably top three defensive line.	
2	I don't think they're three in the nation. They're going to be up there though.	
1	They're going to be a great great team and they'll be and they'll keep a lot of games close because of their defense. It's going to be interesting to see what Gaddis does especially if especially with this new offense. He has to get things on film out there. But at the same time like I am totally okay with him hiding 70% of the Playbook.	
2	He could win eight or nine games this year solely on what they did last year.	
1	Run the ball manage the clock you can win a lot of the games by double digits easily. If you could win these games without showing your hand. I will be thrilled. I will be amazed if you want to like hold a certain playbook for certain teams.	
2	Please do that. You know, I don't want to see I don't want to see the whole play Playbook opened up against Iowa. I don't want to see the whole Playbook open up at Maryland like I want to see what happens against Michigan State against a very good defense and Ohio State a very good team who's very very talented.	
1	The only team that is more talented in the Big Ten.	
2	So Michigan stay home got that as a win at Indiana little bit of a trap game. Also a win Indiana does play Michigan pretty pretty tough. But I do have them at a at a win there. They'll probably win by like 7 or 10 points. Roughly biggest game of the year as you guys knows when we home against Ohio State. You know, this sounds very home worried. But you know, I think this is the year that they do get that done and people are going to roll their eyes, but you know, there's consistency coming back from once and there's less questions more, you know, get things done and I think with the offense and the defense and what happened last year were 62-39.	
1	I mean you could say 62-39 End of the day it is, you know, it's that's is 23 points, you know, 62-39 looks really really bad and it was really really bad watching it.	
2	But you know, I think they do get that get that done this year. I do believe that Michigan gets a chance to to get to Indianapolis think they will tie. I think they will tie. Either Ohio State or Penn State? No, no not pens pencils. I think Penn State will end up with with two or three losses and Conference. I think that Michigan is going to tie Ohio State and then be able to go to Indianapolis and hopefully when to get a shot at the cfp. Other scenario I have here is if no myshkin goes into the Ohio State game at 11:00 and oh and for some reason I can definitely see Ohio State going into that game with two losses in the conference and I can see Michigan going to Indianapolis. No matter what it'll feel a lot better if oh if that's a win versus Ohio State.	
1	But the loss wouldn't stay as bad knowing that there's still a big 10 championship in front of them and a shot at a cfp as well to if you go and if you win the Big 10 and 12 in one beating teams like Penn State, Iowa, Wisconsin Notre Dame know hopefully Michigan state stays up in the rankings to you're going to be, you know, go five and one first the top 20 teams in the country.	
2	At twelve and one you should be able to build yourself in for a cfp birth, whether that's going to be as a three-seater for see. So tough schedule man tough schedule you have what one two three four you have, you know, six six ranked teams in the preseason in the top 20 and you have Army which you know, which has that, you know weird quirky offense is really annoying. Then you have Indiana, you know, that's a that's a very trappy game and Indiana's play, Michigan. Very very close in the last few years or so, but I still believe that Michigan can go through the season 11 and 1 with a chance at a Big Ten championship and a cfp birth.	
1	I just don't want them to play Florida again in some bowl. Like I might not watch I mileage. It might not watch unless it's a cfp game. I legit might not watch if they play Florida again in like the orange. Bowl or Citrus or whatever it is.	
2	So which kind of takes me to the next spot mean very tough very tough tough conference the East the east of stuff but like you know, how how did it get to this point?	
1	So I went back on two four seven and I looked at a few things it comes down to talent and it comes down to how these guys are recruiting. So when it comes to the Big Ten West Nebraska is the only team in the last three years that's including 2019 till 2019 2018 2017. They are the only team even coming close to recruiting on a Big 10 East top three level top for you know, you have 2019 Michigan was number one in the conference Penn State was number two when the conference. Oh hi. States was number three and the conference you're going to see a trend coming up here in 2018. Penn State was number two in the conference. Ohio state was number one in the conference, Michigan was number three in the conference. 2017 Ohio state was number one in the conference Penn State number three, Michigan number two.	
2	2016	
1	Michigan number two in the conference Ohio State number one in the conference, Michigan State number three in the conference. Fourth place there was Penn State. At number 20 in the country. So you had four teams from the same division ranked in the top 20 nationally in 2016.	
2	Michigan was number eight always she was number four Michigan state was 17 Penn State was number 20 2015. I mean again, Ohio state was number one.	
1	Penn State was number two, Michigan State number three and now was like, I think that was Brady hoax last year Bad season do got fired and Michigan still with their talent their talent average was like around an 87. I believe I've believe that was higher than any big ten west team. Which is wild which was wild to me and also. you know who's done a decent job at recruiting Maryland has Maryland in 2018. They were ranked number 28 in the country. There are a number 28 in the country. 2017 Marilyn was ranked 18th.	
2	in the country makes you wondered. They are trying so hard to keep up but they can't because they're in this Gauntlet of a division. You put Maryland out west they win seven or eight games every single year just from a talent standpoint. Just from just from just from Talent. Nebraska is the only team who comes close.	
1	Like I said 2019 there were 18th in the country and I believe they were 23rd and both 2017 and 2018. Why is the Big 10 East why is the Big 10 East why why are they the four best?	
2	Why are they the four best, you know, there's a reason why they're the four best teams pretty much every year is because they recruit at a higher level than everyone else Michigan state is kind of dropped off in the last couple years, but you can see it on the field.	
1	You can see the talent. Like it's it's not even close. It's not even close. I mean, Iowa and Wisconsin those coaches do a good job at coaching their kids up, you know great job, but at the same time, you know, sometimes that Talent just overwhelms any type of scheme that you decide to put out there.	
3	sucks, man	
1	If they want to even this thing out, I mean you like they should really switch Penn State and Purdue like Penn State and Purdue should switch.	
2	If those two guys switch, I think it it bounces out a lot. It balances out a lot. It keeps the Purdue Indiana rivalry.	
1	Nobody's really a Penn Stater. I mean like whose arrival in the conference of Penn State? I like I think I think Maryland tried one year, but I'm like that's not really a thing. So Penn State should be out west. I know geographically it doesn't make sense. But at the same time I mean	
2	Neither do these divisions. They don't make sense at all. Whatsoever. Penn State should go out west produce should should come east mean it just it just makes the most sense easily. It should happen but won't happen because	
1	Big Ten just wants to be lopsided the pig 10.	
2	Just they just want to kind of do their own thing, which is completely fine.	
3	Which is fine.	
2	so usually usually I read over the I read over the mailbag questions like as I go, but I peeked I accidentally peaked at the very first question and and it was a great question and it and it and it had me thinking so I did some research. The first question I got was from Rick Moody. You think Juwan is going to reel in any of these big fish? If not, how screwed are we so there's ten names 10 names 10.	
1	Tean there's 10 names that I've done research on and there's 10 names that you sure that you should be highlighting and you should be very mindful of when they come up. Okay? first name	
2	if you guys want to get a pen and paper or you guys want to take some notes on I'll give you about five seconds.	
3	All right.	
1	and names that you should have highlighted or you should put a box right next to it.	
2	So write a name put a nice sized box next to it.	
1	So as time goes you can either put an X through it if they commit somewhere else or takes Michigan off of their top or put a checkmark that they committed 10 names.	
3	first name	
1	Isaiah Todd so I'm going to say these names first then I'm going to go through each one to like kind of give you the feedback on pretty much where they are. First name is Isaiah Todd.	
2	Ranked number 11 nationally. number 2 power forward in the country Isaiah Todd next name one of the more popular names	
1	popular popular.	
2	That's just my accent popular one of the more popular names NE Mari Burnett. NE Mari Burnett Like I'm running a spelling bee right now. Demarre Burnett the number 22 nationally ranked player in the country number-5 combo guard in the country.	
1	Cuz got that the Mari Burnett. He's a Chicago Kid Chicago Kid.	
2	He's pretty close with it's pretty close with Juwan.	
3	He should be. All right.	
2	Next up we have Walker.	
1	Kessler	
2	Walker Kessler the number 15 player in the country the number 3 Center	
1	in the country All right. Next we have Lance where? lamps where	
2	number 39 kid in the country number 8 power forward in the country name is Lance where? All right, next up. We have Hunter Dickinson. Hunter Dickinson, he's out of DeMatha Catholic	
1	Out of the WCA see probably the best Catholic basketball league in the country and of the DC, Maryland, Virginia area hundred Dickinson.	
2	He's the number 30 player in the country number 5 Center in the country. Next up we have Scooby Johnson. number 20 number 122 nationally number 22 power forward next up. We have Henry Coleman Henry. Coleman is number 38 nationally number 7 power forward little bit undersized at 6:00 6:00, but it's a solid player number 38 nationally number seven power forward Henry Coleman next up. We have Jamin brakefield. Jamin brakefield number 32 in the country number 5 power forward All right, next up. We have Josh Christopher. He's one of the he's another one who you guys should know about Josh Christopher.	
1	He's number nine in the country's a top-10 prospect out of Cali number one shooting guard in the country.	
2	very very good ball player Alright, also we here we have Jaden Springer Jaden Springer. Number 12 in the country number 3 shooting guard in the country.	
1	So that should be the 10. That should be the 10 if he can get two of them.	
3	two	
2	call it a success. I think there's five available. One of those is going to Zeb Zeb Jackson. He's a top 60 player big number 10 shooting guard in the country. He can really who I think he's a he's a guy that you can also put on the ball as a bigger point guard just a bigger scoring point guard.	
1	He's explosive.	
2	He's getting taller and taller every month every time I checked. Out great player one Soul. You know, I think there's five spots. So Zeb is one of them the next one's going to BJ's Howard. I believe so. So Jason is Howard son is Juwan son. Jace was recruited by the Northern, Illinois San Diego State and I think dating. And he's he's going to commit to Michigan. It's only like a matter of time.	
1	So you have Zeb you have Jace if you can get two of these dudes, if you get two of these 10, if you get two of these 10, and then get a fifth guy from somewhere whether that's You know a kid who transfers in and walks on who has been showing out in practice whether it's a transfer coming in. I don't know but if he could get to out of these 10 names it's going to be huge. It's going to be huge. There are some that are more far-fetched than others. So like no Mari Burnett, Michigan has a shots.	
2	Michigan has a legit shot. He's down to Michigan, Alabama, Louisville, Oregon and Texas Tech. That's a great list to be on you know, that's that is that is your ideal top five that you would want as a Michigan fan Oregon has some of the best Who's out there?	
1	So does lousiville band my has NATO's now, so he's going pretty hard. Nate oats is a huge Midwestern guy. So, I'm pretty sure he's Keys going at Amari pretty hard.	
2	You know, John's got to be able to pull some of those Chicago roots. And as much as he Mission has a shot with Ana Mari, I'm going to go the other way with someone who like these are this is not the top five. You want to see so Isaiah Todd number 11 the in the country number 2 power forward in the country his final five are Michigan.	
1	That is Memphis, Kentucky, Kansas, North Carolina.	
2	I mean, I mean here I'm not saying the Michigan doesn't have a shot. But I mean	
1	if there was a line of ugh of a lot of like hot people Michigan will be like the ugly one if that's if that's the if that's the top five missions going to have a long way to go that's thing is just to get them on campus and just fall in love with the college the university the facilities and don't tell me about Michigan's facilities are state-of-the-art. Duh. So is like 80% Parents of high major division ones like they were we they all got the same thing. They all have state-of-the-art facilities. They all have state-of-the-art academic. They all have state-of-the-art, you know, the athletic center they all have state-of-the-art gear.	
2	They all they all have it is just a matter of we're going to fall in love with does the staff do their job. Kid Lance where it's going to be between Kentucky Michigan. I mean, he's I think there has to be a be a Kentucky guy the the nice part about seeing Kentucky Alana top 5 lists.	
1	They can't get everyone fortunately. They can I know they churn out a lot of one and dones and to in done so they always have scholarships opening up. They're not going to sign a And player class. So if they're on a top five list of someone it's not always a bad thing just always keep that in mind.	
2	They can't sign everybody but he is a hard Kentucky lean in my opinion Walker Kessler really skilled big guy that he's leaning Duke. So if they don't get him, you know go with Hunter Dickinson who was a Notre Dame lean right now.	
1	I think that that's one. School, that's one school where they don't have the facilities like Michigan. Does Michigan has a lot of freaking students Notre Dame is like eight or nine thousands like a little like if you take a like if you take Grand Blanc multiply it by 3. That's how big it is like he's not very big.	
2	But if you must go like a bigger School Michigan's right there right there also in the mix is Purdue and he has Florida State's right there and Louisville, but Notre Dame is a hard lean right now.	
1	He should be visiting campus and I think Michigan does have a shot that's out there in my opinion.	
2	Scooby Johnson, I think he wants to stay closer to home. Not sure Michigan state has offered him yet.	
1	But I hope Michigan is still on him because he's someone who's not gonna be a one-and-done guy.	
2	He can probably be a three or four-year player. And those are the types of guys that you need to have a championship Squad at some point. You need that consistency to keep the core real real tight Henry. Woman believe he's a do clean. He also has Ohio State NC State and Virginia Tech Ohio state has this dude named Ryan peden hell of a recruiter hell of a dude, I hate Ohio state, but I love that guy. You have Josh Christopher. Josh Christopher he is a he's probably going to be a wanted done guy wanted done guy and I think he's going to go to Kentucky Kentucky over UCLA UCLA. I believe just picked up a commit today from the number one point guard in the country these like a seems like it's like six five so he's got to share the rock with with that dude. So I think Kentucky is going to be a little bit harder. They're harder to beat but get them on campus who What could happen another guy Jaden Springer number 12 in the country? No number 3 shooting guard. He's got NC State, Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina. Probably picks, North Carolina, but I also see Tennessee right there once again, get them on campus and see what happens. All we need is to all all we need is two because look we look we have Zeb. We have Zeb great Isaiah Todd. No not as are tied Zeb. Great. We have J's Howard coming in, you know, not sure if he's gonna be able to play right away, but that's two of the that's two of the five spots available. So if you can get two of the last three spots filled by one of these dudes,	
1	Looking really good. You're looking really really good.	
2	You're looking at one, maybe two five stars a four-star in Jeb Jace when the new rankings come out, they'll probably put them as a two or three star if he chooses to commit that's just how that goes and then give the fifth to whether it's a transfer coming in or someone who's just been busting their tail and practice. so two of those 10 names Missions got to have it if they if they don't I really hope that they do have plan B and plan C. And I really hope that they're not paying too much attention to someone who's not a shot when that attention could go to someone else who would really love the school. So let me get to the rest of these questions. So rig those a great question man, I do appreciate it. All right, Matt Blanc asked you see who was the best sniper in fortnight? outside of me I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Who do I play with? Logan thinks he's good.	
3	on the sniper	
1	I'm not sure Kyle's okay on the sniper. So are you Matt? So do you think Langford returning can actually make MSU worse? That is a good question life would returning I don't think it can make MSU worse, but I think is oh had one of his best coaching jobs last year because he had to coach he didn't have the he didn't have the talent.	
2	To not coach if that makes sense, I think in 16 and 17. He kind of LED his guys. Well, hold on. 16 17	
1	17 18 Seasons, I think he kind of let his guys, you know, just kind of hoop and play took some things for granted that he over coached at times. I think last year length were getting hurt and Ward getting hurt are two of the best things to happen to that team because now is O had to really look at coaching and he really had to scheme and they had the perfect.	
2	Shut up, they had the perfect rolls just lined up.	
1	You had caches who had heavy usage and he did a great job on the ball. You had McQuade his job was to was 3 and D make threes and guard the other team's best Wing player. Aaron Henry came into his own to be kind of that. Second Wing score.	
2	And then you had Kenny Kenny Kenny Kenny Goins play and he became a free Indie guy.	
1	And you had tellman who really is old played him as for he's at now a five-spot.	
2	So Israel was forced to play a more modern lineup and And yeah that in that just spelled trouble if he if he comes in next year and put Stillman at the floor and Julius marble at the five and he's going to have a repeat of 16 17 17 18. He needs to keep the he needs to keep the lineups more modern he needs to be able to	
1	Manage his talent because he's gonna be really talented. He has length for coming back. He has Watts. He has another shooting guard coming into like he has a lot of talent coming in. How is he going to deal with the minutes? You know, who's not going to play and his is he okay with that are the players okay with that. Does he want to please everyone type of deal? It could be I mean The more talent for him doesn't necessarily mean it's a it's a good thing. You only need five to start and two or three to play but if you have nine or ten talents and guys were ready to play. You know, how are you going to manage? How are you going to manage that and having a quick leash early with freshmen isn't always a good thing sometimes last year. He let Aaron Henry play through a lot of missed a lot of mistakes and he did that because he couldn't stop them out for anyone. You can't sell about Aaron Henry and put in Foster lawyer to make a point. I mean, he's not trying to lose games. So yeah make them worse. No, but it's going to but it's going to put Israel and his staff in a position to where they really need to take a step back and really see, you know, who's is going to help this team? well Yeah, and who are we who's going to be unhappy with less minutes? Another question you asked was which is more difficult when Nash championship in football or basketball. Okay, which is more difficult winning the national championship in football or basketball. I think each of them have their own difficulties, which makes them both very very hard.	
2	Let's start with football. So in football, it's not an even playing field for everyone.	
1	So that's already tough. That's already hard. There's four spots and five big-time conferences that mean that that still doesn't make sense to me. So you're telling me because I go, you know Ted into on the year. I play six ranked teams highly ranked teams, but this team over here when 12 and oh they played one team right number 23, they get to go to the cfp. Just	
2	Our schedule is due to I mean that it just it just doesn't make sense.	
1	It's not an even playing field not a lot of games to base things off of is not like college basketball where you're playing 30 to 35 games and then based off of that huge sample. You could really see head, you know, head-to-head matches and all that and you have 68 teams that can get in of the like 350 something that's out there. So so what was that like to like roughly twenty twenty percent it--she little bit less 18 19 percent like 18 19 percent of teams. get into the national get into the NCAA tournament in basketball when only like six percent get in for the FBS.	
2	So it's a different playing field.	
1	You really have to be more conscious about your scheduling because the committee looks at losses, I believe first and then from there they may look a strength of schedule if there's like three teams like back to back to back and I think it really helps them that they're allowed to re ranked teams every single week.	
2	Like starting in like one was like that starts win, like end of October early November when they start that cfp ranking thing.	
1	I don't know when they when they start that but that helps them because you can't just come out at the end and say oh this is what we were thinking this whole time. We see what they're thinking this whole time. So it's a bit tougher. If you lose two games in the first five games, you're not going to be in a cfp.	
2	P if you lose a non-conference game to if it's Michigan if you lose the Army on some fluke play and then you run the table 12 in one you're probably not going to get in if there's another twelve and one team who say lost to USC or they lost to Oregon like that Army loss is huge.	
1	You lose that game. There's no cfp. Now your goal. Okay lessons when the conference get into a great bowl and let's see after that. Why is it difficult in basketball is difficult in basketball because so many factors come into play like you can I think out of the last 10 champions? Eight of the years if you had flipped some of the 1 season 2 seeds around there would have been a different national champion and it's all because of the route of which you have to go through like in 2018, Michigan got you know a very favorable route. Cuz there were some up some some upsets happened. Now, you're not playing a team is good. Now you're playing a team that you know, when they play your style of play. There's no real Advantage for them.	
3	So.	
1	It's tougher from that standpoint because you have to get the right path to get to the to get to the final four and the NCAA Championship. It's easier on the point that you're in the dance. You're in the dance, you have to win four games and you're in the final four. So it's easier from that standpoint think they each have their own difficulties is really hard to say which one is more difficult than the other the reach very very tough pretty much on the same level.	
2	But I will say that the NCAA basketball they do give they give the right teams access to the championship unlike other teams.	
1	They'll be more even they will be more even and on the same plane when they go to an 18 and 18 playoff where they take the five champions of power 5 you have to go to say you would have Northwestern beat, Ohio State. Like then they get to go like oh no, it's I don't know what to say. If you win your conference. You should be able to go and play for a national championship. Like I don't like I don't care if a team didn't win a noncom if you win your conference, you get an at large bid you get to go and then you have to accuse you have to automatic wanna automatic qualifiers. I mean you have five automatic qualifiers from whoever wins the conference. Then you have two at-large bids. So altai those five teams who are the two highest ranked People based off of the cfp. Then you take the highest ranked group of five team as well too.	
2	Now there could be a situation where there could be a situation where the where the You know two at-large has you know. One could be from the SEC. The second team could be a group of five team. And I think from there you can either go with a group of five or you can just go with the next highest team no matter what because the group of five slot has been taken care of and I'm pretty sure the group of five will like two teams in there. But until it becomes a larger tournament, I can't really say	
1	Is Juwan going to get Kessler brunette and how badly does Michigan need one of those five stars?	
2	He's recruiting back to what I was saying to out of those ten guys. I mentioned Isaiah Todd the Mario Burnett Lance where Walker Kessler hundred Dickinson Scooby Johnson Henry Coleman, Jamin brakefield Josh Christopher and Jaden Springer just get to to minimum one and you're not in terrible shape is Neapolitan ice cream one.	
1	Over a three flavors.	
2	It's three hundred percent is three flavors of ice cream. I don't know how they get it to look like that like in the box like in a little tub, but it's definitely three. I don't know how they like organize those like perfectly and like three different compartments.	
1	It's pretty weird Sonic cheesy toss best food ever. No, no, chili cheese tots are really really good. I like it.	
2	Especially when Sonic Ashley has Chile as Army a trap game went back to that. No because they kind of showed their cards against Oklahoma last year this your nose that coming in I think they'll be fine.	
1	Plus I've heard that Don Brown has come out and said that they that they spend every practice whether it's 10 to 15 minutes on Army and they've been	
2	Doing that since last spring so I think they're going to be fine. I think they're going to be well prepared and they should be able to win that game quite easily.	
1	Do we need to close the deal with more than one of these top 20 types in the next two classes to believe our new ceiling of the program are acoustic Memphis at the least and you Ki best isn't site. New ceiling. I mean if you could just get bad to be line ceiling I'll be fine with that.	
2	I mean, you know be lines bar is really freaking High, you know, you have to get to that point before we start talking about anything else when it comes to like recruiting. I mean Beyond did a really good job.	
1	For someone to for people to say he's not he didn't recruit very well and then be upset at how many players leave for the NBA like like that doesn't make sense to me. He needs to recruit better gosh, darn it. Why is everyone leaving for the NBA? Like that doesn't make sense?	
2	Yeah, it does not make sense whatsoever. He's probably sent the most shooting guards and wings to to the league in the last five years more than anyone else not including one and dones more than anyone else guaranteed guaranteed its while Another question here. Let me see if I can get to it. How do we judge whether the current Dynamic Adventures given received from five stars as a new Norm means one has real deal in his vehicle he able to recruit at the top and Afterglow from hiring a higher profile NBA guy or something in between the current Dynamic of Interest given received from five stars is a new Norm.	
1	Well, you had well You have to know that be lying dead go after five stars.	
2	Like he is it's not like he ignored them but as much as we're trying to learn I'm trying to learn to if I knew his philosophy and we're about one or two years in you know, I'm not giving you ten names.	
1	I'm giving you like four or five because I'm like, yo look in that this kid, he'll be great doing this looking at this kid. To be great doing this. I'm giving you names just based off of how good they are. I don't know. How is how I was going to fit in the system. So be line. Yes. He did go after five stars, but he went after kids who fit his hoof it him whether you were a five or four star or three star. He was like I can see you doing this. It's not even about what you're ranked. It's not even about how many stars you have. It's about how does this person fit Michigan basketball? So, it's cool. It's cool that we're going after these top guys, but you could offer all the 5-star guys you want you have 3/5 Stars commit. If one of them is a cancer two of them leaves, I mean one of them leaves during the winter break and go and transfers. I mean, it's not even you know basket there is such a talent the talent Gap in basketball is narrowing every single year between the elite and the average player. I say that's opposite in football where the Gap is seems like it's like widening. The Gap is narrowing every single year in college basketball. It's so much more about getting the right kids. Not necessarily the best kids you can have you can have a kid who was number 15. On the core and a kid who was number 60 on the court and number 60 is going to give him he'll all because he's doing things by you know, by the way, he was coached while number 15 may be out there thinking of I got to make sure that I dropped this many points or I'm concerned about this or I have my circle saying I got to do this and that my Camp is saying I got to do this and that like you don't need those cancers. So if these five-star guy Eyes if they are what Juwan once as a player great if he's just getting these guys just from a talent standpoint that can kill a team that can kill a team. So hopefully hopefully fingers crossed that these are that these are players that fit whatever Juwan wants to do. Hopefully, these are players that fit the new Michigan basketball.	
2	That's all. Oh, I want that's all I want. It's not about high profile and be a guy like that means absolutely nothing penny is down in Memphis. He has been in on the AAU circuit for a while. He's been in high school sports for a while. He's kind of like dug in the Grass Roots a bit.	
1	He's getting a bunch of Highly ranked players. May or may not turn into winds but they're really really good players. He could he could have easily recruited two or three cancers where he's going to have a hard time getting to the tournament.	
2	Who knows so you got to really recruit. For the kid and the person that they are as well as how talented they are. All right. Next we got one five players. Would your ideal 2020 class have in it Zeb Jackson is one already. Alright ideal think I went over this kind of Zeb huge. I think Jace is gonna be there.	
1	So we're just going to add him.	
2	I think he's gonna commit probably in the next couple months or so you'd probably be in early signing period guy so of the next three spots, I would I I want I do want to Michigan guy in there Scooby Johnson will be great. I would love him and their scuba is going to be a three or four-year player. No, Marty Burnett's going to be good. And then either Walker Kessler or hundred Dixon Dickinson because we're going to need a big. Our bigs are in their sophomore year at minimum now, so we're going to need we're going to need a big badly from the 2020 group for sure for sure. So getting Walker or getting Dickinson is going to be big right there and they'll probably be able to find for playing time right away by their sophomore year. It'll be it should be 13. If you can only pay one player big money, do you choose dagger Zeke Zeke hundred percent?	
1	Zeke deck isn't even good but like this whole cowboy thing is driving me crazy. Like they have a chance. They had a chance to make some noise this year. They have a chance to go, you know tennis 6 11 and 5 and then, you know, you know get to the playoffs and do some things why you know that turn down 30 when he's worth fifteen. If that because he wants 40 dude let that man.	
2	I am I am so frustrated at this whole situation this it's on it's unreal. It's unreal pay Zeke. Stop disrespecting him to the media Jerry.	
3	Jones	
2	pay the man get him to the helmet and let's get and let's get to work Dak franchise him draft a quarter drafted good quarterback and let that dude go.	
1	Easy dad thinks that thinks he's like really really nice like nah, like you are not you are not good like that. And why do you want all that money? Like why do you want 40 mil? Like we have like over 50 other dues that we have to pay. Like come on man. Come on, man. Tom Tom Brady took less to make sure that certain guys around him could get paid.	
2	Tom Brady with all the Rings. Come on, man. They got me worked up Bruce. Come on. Alright, Eric Dale ask me who will have a better career at Michigan out of the Wagner. Bros are friends. Only stays a year. We can compare best.	
1	It is really hard.	
2	It is really really hard to have a better career than what moded.	
3	Your mole was a first-round draft pick.	
1	He he led Michigan to back to back. Big Ten Tournament championships, he led Michigan to the national title game me you have big shoes to fill. I don't think friends are going to be able to impact the game like Wagner dick because Wagner was a big who could do a lot of things.	
2	There's a lot of guards out there and wings out there. I think France is going to be very very good but it's going to be hard to top two big tent Ernie championships and they in a national title game. Antoine Walker, how is he not in the Hall of Fame guy can go come back and play now. I don't think about playing now, but he should definitely be in the hall be in the Hall of Fame because he's a beast. Alright, MGO burner asked me favored Coldplay song.	
3	Whoo.	
2	I love for those who don't know me. I love Coldplay. I love Coldplay. Like I am always in the mood for Coldplay. So I have like, I like a road trip playlist whenever I'm driving for over 30 minutes. I always play it. It's the same. Arms over and over and over and I can't get enough of it.	
1	So do I have a do I have a favorite? I have favorite songs like not one song because each one hits you different like they all like I said, they sound the same but they all put me in the same mood like very chill happy, you know, the sun's out the sun shining bright man. It's a great day.	
2	So	
1	Sparks is one magic clocks fix you speed of sound talk the scientist trouble yellow adventure of a lifetime Viva la Vida and shiver.	
3	on repeat	
2	on repeat over and over and over and over and over. I love Coldplay man. Even talking about him right now. Just puts me in a good mood. Who stays longer Harbor I Michigan or day at OSU?	
1	Dad Ryan day.	
2	Is he still recruiting at a high level? I do think that Harbaugh does get it done against him this year.	
1	It's going to be. The years after that though.	
2	I mean if you look at the way that Ohio state has been recruiting.	
1	I don't know when they're going to have a chance to beat them again.	
2	It'll be Dylan McCaffrey's year next year and he's a hell of a quarterback. But the way that Ohio Ohio state is out recruiting Michigan right now on the trail. I'll try to 2019 but they had a I think OSU had a had a had a smaller class.	
3	but	
2	Hold on now that I'm here. Let me check. Let me check this right quick because pretty sure yeah because I'm pretty sure miss get out recruited them. In 2019. But I'm more interested in 2020 right now and Ohio State's fourth. They have already committed to five stars and 11 4 stars. Michigan sitting at 10 but yeah, and their average recruiters a 92 out of a hundred Michigan's is at 89. So don't when you're looking at when you're looking at like the different teams and where they're ranked and all that stuff also pay attention to the number on the left where it says how many are committed but below that look at their average. Look at the recruit average that really tells you that really tells you, you know, like where they are. In terms of the type of guys that you know, they're they're recruiting like Ohio State to five stars next year 11, 4 stars and 9 3 stars. Michigan has 13 3 stars No, 5 Stars 11 4 stars. I stargaze little bit more when it comes to football. Because it's showing you know, it has shown that you know, the higher the better recruit you get. I mean the better your team usually does. I mean if you look at the top Clemson, Alabama LSU, Ohio State, Georgia, I mean, Texas, I mean If you look at the preseason top 10, that's I mean, that's who I mean they're all right there. They're all right there. So the way that these rankings fall it's it is not a fluke. So I do pay attention a lot more to like the stargazing with with the football team rankings. And if I go back to 2019 to I do know that Michigan was No, they were ranked number one in the conference while Ohio state was number three which is a which is a good thing.	
1	But at the same time, let me look at a couple things.	
2	So Michigan, they were finished 90.7 eight to five stars 14 four stars. That's like, you know, like that's really really good. That's really really good and Ohio State.	
1	eight	
2	Pat 3/5 Stars nine four stars, their average recruiting was still higher they were at ninety one point eight seven. While Michigan was 90 points seven eight. So even they out recruited them in terms of ranking, you know, really pay attention to that sidebar of the quality of recruits of coming in because that's that's just as important as as the final ranking number. So just a heads up there. What is Isaiah livers? Oh, sorry. I didn't even answer that who stays longer Harbor or Michigan or day at OSU? I think I honestly think Harbaugh is going to be here for a long long time. And I think if day slips up a few years of losing to Michigan going in for nine or nine and three, they're not going to tolerate that Columbus but heard the kids love them and I heard he's a Players coach so hopefully he he drops off a few pegs and you know, hopefully recruiting slows down and all that fun stuff and it kind of stays down for a while. So Mission can kind of Turn The Tide next question from Brian Krause. What does Isaiah livers ceiling as a pro is your first round guy this year?	
1	if you had asked me this in The first week of June, you know, I would have said you don't know he's not really a first-round guy not this year and you know when it comes to being a pro he needs some things to work on after seeing how teams are drafting. He is most definitely a first round. Bye. Teams are finally wising up and not picking base off of potential and they're not picking based off of athleticism only.	
2	I mean, they're not there finally no longer picking projects because they're realizing that doesn't work having a guy who's 610 who can't really shoot bucking really jump and play a little bit of defense like those guys.	
1	Don't plan the league There's no space for 610 skinny guys who can't shoot a jump shot.	
2	There's no space for you in the NBA laborers is about 6 7 6 8 he can really shoot the ball which is going to be which is going to be helpful for him. He can really shoot the ball if he can prove that he can make plays off the bounce shooting at the same level or a little bit more than be nice. But if he can If he can make plays off the bounce and if he shows that he's more explosive to yes. He most definitely has a chance to be a first-round guy next year and it sounds crazy. But you think I'm crazy.	
1	Look go back go back and take a look at the draft.	
2	Look how guys are drafting The Seer little drop to like what the 20s. Need that was like a that was a lottery pick coming in. But but teams are realizing, you know, you need guys who can shoot guys who can score at mulch who can score and multiple ways gotta be able to if you can shoot you can finish at The Rim you were drafted pretty high if you had a trouble if you had trouble shooting The Rock	
1	You slipped automatically.	
2	So Isaiah has a shot. He's just you'll get to that if you get to that next level as a ballplayer, you'll be all right. How dumb is Dak Prescott? Super dumb? Okay.	
1	Thank you guys again, you know, thank you again for supporting me.
