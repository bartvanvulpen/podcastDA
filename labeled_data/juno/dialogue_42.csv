1	Hi babe, it's me, Abby. I hope you're busy right now doing something you love.	
3	Maybe you're with friends or going for a walk. Maybe you're at work. Hope you're doing anything but social media. I want to talk to you about that. But before I do let's get some relaxing going on wiggle your fingers.	
1	Squeeze your eyes shut and then open them shot. Then open them wiggle wiggle fingers. We're on social media all the time. I want our computers all the time and our fingers get crampy and our wrists. We got the wrist squeeze the I open my eyes because I open my eyes squeezed the I open the eye.	
2	Okay.	
3	So the affirmation I have for today is this is a good one. I am loved. I am loved. I am loved.	
2	I just got chills oof.	
1	So easy to forget but it's so true.	
3	You are loved I am loved we are love itself. I've been thinking a lot about social media lately and how it is affecting our lives and I know you'd ask me am I wasting my life on social media and	
2	And I think yes.	
3	I think social media is not good. I think it can be used as a tool and it can be useful and it can be good in very small doses. But we're all addicted to it it there's a dopamine response when we get likes and followers and shares and comments were getting a rush.	
1	It's a drug next thing, you know two hours of past or three hours of past or four. The past and you've been scrolling and looking at other people's content and haven't been living your life. So are we wasting our lives on social media? We are our lives are so precious. We have a limited amount of time and there's always going to be a new social media platform. If it's not Instagram, it's tick tock you know it we had we had my space and then Facebook and then Instagram and Snapchat and there's no there's no end game for social media. It's just get bigger. And further and all this stuff and I think use it smartly use it in moderation. Maybe make one post a week or if you really need to make one post a day get on there make the post and get out of there or you could take one day out of the month to make all of your social media content and get it all ready and then just release it throughout the month and then you're only doing one day for social media that still seems like a lot of time one day out of the month 130th. Of your life. I don't know. I think we have to come up with a better a better way to user lies.	
3	I could think of so many other ways volunteering help some kids you could work for the Opera you could work for the Opera and help them make more operas. I think people like the Opera I've never been but it seems to be popular among a certain. Elite Community, there's just you know, just text people call them or see them in person. That's that's how I want to do social media, but alas, I am a slave to this this weird weird time we're living in and I'm going to try to improve along with you.	
1	So my challenge for you and for me is every time you have an urge to go on social media.	
3	Yeah smell something. You don't like this is called an inversion or aversion therapy Phoebe. Did it on friends. She was trying to trying to like get over a boyfriend and every time she looked at his picture she would slap her hand and then it would hurt and then she wouldn't look every time she saw him.	
1	It would be associated with pain and then she would get over him so we can do that with social media every time you want to go on social media use open a bag of kimchi, which I do enjoy when I'm eating it, but the smell is horrible. Terrific, I don't know why it needs to smell so terrible, but it does so every time you want to go on Instagram sniffle Little Kim. Not Lil Kim the rapper Lil Kim Chi because look him probably smells great. I bet she's got like really fancy perfume. And right lotions.	
3	She's amazing Love Lil Kim.	
1	If you have like a killer post go go out there and post it take two minutes boom bam bam, but if not, you just feel like checking it because you're you're postponing the rest of your - you're putting your dreams on hold and your human interactions on hold so that you can see what Karen is up to who cares of Karen's in the mountains who cares of Karen's engaged. You don't even know Karen you hardly know Karen and you can't possibly really know her from social media. So stop scrolling if you want to know how Karen's vacation was text her FaceTime her take her to lunch dance dance dance and reminds me of a song I Don't care how many followers you have as long as you're kind and smart. I don't care how many followers you have as long as you're kind and smart and funny as long as you're kind and smart and funny as long as you're kind and smart and funny and hot and cool and hot and cool and hot and cool.	
4	And as long as you have at least a thousand followers because anything less than that is weird. Just kidding. You should not judge your worth on follow.	
1	Hours, cool. I'll talk to you soon. Bye babe.
