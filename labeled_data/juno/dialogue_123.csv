And there's a mystery of brewing with Jughead. Oh baby Riverdale is back. Let's do it. I'm Maria Menounos and you're tuned in to AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of TV talk now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Says that this is the time for the Riverdale after show right here AfterBuzz TV. Look at that. There we go. So nice you think I'm going to be going into are we announcing my tour dates at the end of the episode? Look everybody the river laughter show breaking down all the craziness that's happening there at for our teenagers there in Riverdale. I'm Frank Moran and I'm getting wolski. Hey guys, and as always like us on Facebook gives us five stars on iTunes. And subscribe to the YouTube channel and give us a thumbs up while you're there and you folks if you want to share your thoughts and opinions, we would love to hear them because the chat is up and running get a computer. That means it's all ready to go.	
1	I'm looking at you guys everyone's excited. So we're excited. Let's go Frank. That's why everyone wants to dive in that's we're going to break it down.	
3	We'll do some predictions. Maybe we'll find a new story or two to drop at the end of it as well. But before we dive in everything in detail, okay, what did you think overall overall very happy that were	
1	To our Riverdale ways. And also I'm really excited that now Cheryl has a new enemy.	
3	Yes. Yeah. It's a she's making a stand against mr. Honey.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited to see where this goes.	
3	It was a semi can certainly last week and we talked about it was certainly a change of pace for the show, but it was a very nice emotional farewell look Perry, but we were both saying okay, once the craziness happening and this did not fail to deliver.	
1	Yeah. Oh I'm excited. And I know it's only gonna get crazier from here.	
3	I'm sorry. I feel like the craziest thing we need to talk about to is Cheryl Cheryl pause that she's got a rivalry with their the principle. That's Brewing. But there's one thing I want to talk about shell first case that we see her at the beginning of the episode. We saw last season that the way they were able to kind of make her think that her brother was alive is that they were they were faking that her brother was still alive, but now we see that she does have indeed the dead body of her brother in her the basement of this house.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, she's a little wacky. Probably not very healthy for her amazing.	
3	She's got it locked away where no one else knows anybody that gets close to kind of going in that direction. She is right there saying no, there's nothing to see here Ray.	
1	She also does really have anyone watching her though. So she kind of like lives alone, you know, so I think it gives them a little freedom to maybe keep a dead.	
3	Be somewhere. I'm also thinking to you know, our hey, dude, you want to do Cheryl, you know, if you want to have that dead body cool, but maybe not put it just in front of just like Gates. We're so easy to see through the gates and see that dead body sitting over at the hand sticking out right one hand perfectly out for anyone to see keep that tucked away around the corner. Nobody's gonna see it. I don't know why she's not doing that.	
1	Look, maybe she wants someone to find him and ask her about it. I don't know.	
3	All right quick thought on Cherry Blossom. Okay. I think that she is gone over the bend. There's a cuckoo bird or because she's got her dead brother hanging out in her basement.	
1	Yeah. No, she's definitely crazy definitely crazy, but she also has like her head on her shoulders. So I don't know. I think she just has some demons.	
3	It's II war though. If Tony and her decided to part ways and she's left alone at this. The house with only Grandma Blossom. Oh boy and Jason's dead body as a really sources of conversation. She's gonna definitely not funny but only sources of conversation.	
1	Yeah, which is not much so it definitely that would be a spiral for her. Yeah. I feel like we would definitely see her spiral if that ever happened.	
3	So please don't Tony don't break up a Cheryl got to stick around we do definitely what we start the episode. Off with Jughead basically filling Us in that after the events of last episode saying goodbye to Fred for the rest of the summer the rest of the crew hanging out with Archie all the time. They got dinner with Matt pops all the time and it seemed like he was getting better and better as the days went on. Yeah, then it's time for the first day of school. We're here if you like the weird like hey, we're just gonna like have a nice hookup. Sesh before school starts.	
1	Yeah. That was and I was like, oh, we're just gonna go Right into this. I mean, I'm happy that my like Fab Four everyone's back together. Everyone's happy in a relationship. But yeah, I mean, I guess you know, no one's parents are really around anymore and they're seniors. Yeah, I guess, you know get the Love on sure.	
3	All right, but they have so much fun though that you forget to set the alarm. And of course you late for your first day senior class. Stay.	
1	Come on guys, get it together ever been.	
3	For school.	
1	Yes easy for you to sneak in only one year when I had my art class my first period because my teacher would always be okay with it. As long as I grabbed her something on my way in. So if I got her like a granola bar or coffee or something, she would be okay with the 10-15 minutes late. You could bribe your way out of it just her thou so I she's not obviously like mr. Honey.	
3	So it's true only late. Once and used to be like our for our school, they would you would check down there like a Scantron sheet where the teacher would kind of everybody was absent and then take it down take it and put it outside the door and me and to my friends got there late and then we just got that sheet and we erased we are absent and then we went off and we just hung out for like the rest of that our first of all you just took the hour off easy enough. Yes. We got away with it was great. So, yes you did you did mention. Mr. Honey, our new principal play biker Smith. Yeah how exciting yes, so certainly comes off as very very rules oriented Mmm Yeah, Mr. Strict. Yes, so there's going to be discipline.	
1	There's going to be order it's going to be consequences, which we know does not go well with his group of friends. No. No, I mean they don't listen to anything.	
3	I mean if you look at we have all the only principle we have to compare to us, mr. Wetherby who started off his out of rice and like Okay, but then he got sucked into the farm.	
1	Yes. So he just kind of turned out to be wacky.	
3	Yes. So, you know, I don't know for a for a high school. Do you need a very strict disciplinarian or do you need somebody that's gonna be compassionate and understanding I think you need some strictness.	
1	Definitely because those are the years when I mean you're rebelling the most at least well, I feel like I did and I didn't want to do something or you know, I was like, oh No One's Gonna Know? It is if I just skip class or go out for lunch with the seniors or something or yeah come in late.	
3	So how many times did you go to the principal's office?	
1	Oh never. Oh, okay. Tardy. I didn't get enough tardies to get me to the principal's office.	
3	Okay. All right, you weren't a disciplinary. I you don't need any disciplinary action.	
1	No, but I think it is good just to have structure and to know that someone is Is there to give you consequences and you can't just go la li la di da keep doing you know those things.	
3	Well one person has we've been kept on talking about your Blossom one person who does not respond well to you know challenges we're being told no right our good old pal Shiro Blossom share old good old Cheryl and she wants to throw a back to school dance. I mean, it's been a rough year last year. We had everything going on with the other group of the Gargoyles rough summer. Yes. Summer you'll let's celebrate with a dance, right? Yeah, and he says no no and but there's part of me that I guess kinda understand because he says, you know the last dance we had her people were murdered.	
1	You know, that's true. Yeah, he doesn't really know anything about Riverdale too much or the high school. And I mean, right he only knows what he's heard or probably read. He hasn't been in the thick of all of it. So I think from an Don't perspective.	
3	That's probably a normal decision, I guess because there's part of me that says like our the last time we had when somebody died so we shouldn't do that again, but then there's also the part of me too. It's like you got to get back on the horse, right?	
1	Yeah. I mean, you can't just not have dances forever.	
3	Yeah, so we should just get right back out and do them and make sure that we're having fun and get away from those. Terrible memories make fun ones.	
1	Yeah. Mr. Honey. You should just make sure that it's a site safer environment.	
3	Yeah, if you're all about order discipline, I feel like you could really set. But a nice security system in there to make sure nobody's going to get bothered.	
1	Oh, yeah. Yeah definitely have some parents come and you know be there for the prom to like security what I do.	
3	I'm trying to think of the right word a chaperone Debra come like a parental guidance that way but wouldn't this is one of your parents are chaperoning.	
1	No, thank God my parents never did that.	
3	I feel so uncomfortable when my parents would like. Hey, I'm going to chaperone. Dancing. No, it's already awkward enough as it is.	
1	Yeah, I would be like I'm not going to go to the next one.	
3	You can chaperone and I'll stay home it's fine. So we basically have our four characters that kind of setting up at least the initial bits of their storylines the season so we've got our Chang and with Mad Dog and we're like about Archie start to get like Mad Dog. Hey, why don't you finish school? Yeah. Well, there's going to finish doing freshman year. So why don't you finish it get your high school diploma.	
1	I'm excited that mad dog is going to stay around for this season. I honestly thought that he wasn't going Come back since the storyline kind of died out.	
3	It's Riverdale does a great thing of introducing a character then dropping them for you know, half a dozen episodes then bringing them up for a hot second but losing him well again, and so by the end of the end of the last season, we saw him hanging out with Archie saying oh, yeah, I'll have to run this Boxing Club, you know, to be honest by this time. I was like, yeah, we're just gonna move past. That was just a season 3 thing but no looks like we're going to be sticking around with Mad Dog hanging out in Archie's life, which I'm all for.	
1	I'm excited and his name is Monroe. No more. Yeah, what a cool name. Like I love that name. And now I just want to call him Monroe and not mad dog is so much sweeter and nicer and I can't wait to get to see the sweet side of it. That's true.	
3	But I have a crush maybe all right early predictors therefore o first time. Yes, so we've got our seed trying to live up to his father's reputation helping others. Then we have got Charles embeddings picking up on are threats on the farm from last year where we've got Alice deep Undercover.	
1	And they're trying to find out because she's missed some of her country check-ins right Alice were worried about you and I honestly think that she's not. Okay. I think that definitely something's going on. I mean Edgar really took to her and wanted to make her his wife well and he did and I don't know I feel like he has a special place for her.	
3	Yeah. I mean certainly he seem to be and she did a great job of selling it last season for sure because even until At the end when she told us like no. No, I'm really in on this and I guess stick around to get a penny out of here, too. Yeah, I go. All right. Well, I guess that justifies your crazy decisions. You are making all this past season. Okay, I'll buy that so I'm glad that she's doing this but then I'll ask you first. What do you think of Charles? Do you think he's he's like, he seems too good to be true. Do you think he is, you know?	
1	Yes, I just get a weird vibe from him. I don't know. What about you? What do you think?	
3	You know, it would be I would love to have somebody like a family member whether it's you know, like a cousin a brother or sister or something coming to the show and not have a hidden agenda. Not turn out to be like a secret creep. It would be nice and so far would be nice Charles is giving me the illusion that everything impression. I should say that he's above board.	
1	Mole that he he he has been reacting to everything. I feel like in a very normal way, but I don't know like wait. Why did he come? Like, where did he come from? I'm just curious.	
3	Yeah, it was like the one scenes. I feel like we haven't really had much yet as I'd like to see more FP and Charles scenes if we're not going to have Alice around she's gonna be hidden. I'd love to see an FP in Charleston just to see how that Dynamic is.	
1	Oh, I would like to see that too.	
3	Yeah, you're my kid that I didn't even know about Mmm, I still think that's it seems weird that we've got a kid that is both a half-brother to book Betty and Jughead. Yep.	
1	Yeah, it's just like a weird like bet he's really the only one who's talking to him. Yeah. No one else is really like conversing withdrawals.	
3	So come on. He's a good guy. He's hiding out in this basement for some over motor reason right where it is. Nice. You know, it's normal. He's got his suit on and everything. Okay, keeping track of well, whatever the farm actions happening.	
1	Yeah, but I also feel like I don't know. Is he being a don't know if he's very trust he's not very trusting of everyone except for Betty Wright with the whole Kevin thing. You know, he was like, why did you say anything?	
3	Like what we can't trust anyone else dive at you, but you mentioned Kevin why don't we talk about him for a hot second because we saw him as Iceland. I lamented last episode. We just see him standing outside with Josie as Archie pulls up. I'll bring His father home and that was it. No words. Nothing said just with his arm around Josie and there we go. Now we get to find out what happened over the summer that pretty much nobody spoke to him. Hmm. I the only one that would even say hello back to him would be Fang and that was through text and so he is claiming that yeah, he's worked on himself. He realizes he doesn't need the farm but he does need his friend. So he's trying to mend fences with Betty, but he still seems untrustworthy.	
1	Yes, you know, I think I think I want to agree with Betty during this and just say that he's honestly probably just lonely and Confused from what I'm seeing. I think he's very trustworthy but he just doesn't know maybe who is his true friend. Like he said he got dropped from the farm. He felt very lost. But he lost his friends because he joined the farm. So he just needs to really be with his friends and really gain there. Trust back I think and we have a lot of people in the chat. Yes who are agreeing and they're saying that Kevin is we got a rune who Cote? I'm sorry if I butchered your name, but he says who's trust who trust Kevin is true to Betty and helps her or is he trying to get back in? What do you think think he's helping her? Maybe? He's just trying to get back in some sort of a friendship grazed or he's just lonely.	
3	I would you know again, I would love to give pennant Kevin the benefit of the doubt because certainly I would think that he would realize he was abandoned by everybody around the farm. Plus he found out where everything that the farm was up to amass enough to make you reconsider your actions. Like why was I supporting this guy that was going to carve out my body parts to sell to somebody else and then I just abandon everything and just took off in the middle of the night deliberately leaving me behind. Yeah, especially because he Frank says you were Left behind because they didn't think you could be trusted and yet there was no that Kevin did at the end of last season that even gave you the slightest impression.	
1	He was in deep into the farm very and deep he would have gave an organ.	
3	Yes. If you just asked him probably he's ready to go at me. Like Betty said you dragged me by my feet to go get a lobotomy. Yeah, so, you know, it's like I don't know how anybody get the impression that we couldn't trust you.	
1	I mean, maybe maybe they did see that sliver where he is. Just very loyal to Betty. You know, I was they've been best friends for a long time.	
3	Yeah, that's you know what the other thing those two is. I feel like this show does not do Kevin enough justice as I've talked about last week two words, like the you say they've been best friends and that's what the show says and we rarely see them having more than like a scene or two together. And then it's you know, then we go several episodes and then reconnect for a hot second and several more episodes. We never really see them hang out just but there's never a Betty kept storyline there hasn't been an	
1	I'm probably like a season or two. Yeah, I agree. They've been very separated more just like surface-level friends because maybe they happen friends for so long.	
3	I'm sure I mean again it goes back to it's all about the core four and then everybody else is just at the whims of whatever the story dictates. I guess we could use Kevin for a scene here. Ok, let's write Kevin and see him but we're not going to do anything else with that character until we need them again. Like it's a little frustrating for moments like this because it's I could go either way with at least the amount of screen time that you've given me on Riverdale of Kevin. I could go either way to whether he's being truthful it better or not. Mmm.	
1	So Logan night says it was probably something that happened during the summer with Kevin and the farm.	
3	I don't know. I mean, yeah, it seemed wonderfully definitely something did happen.	
1	Well not they're not friends no more.	
3	We we do see though that Fang shows up good boy Fang and he's brainwashed. Yeah, he's he's definitely a nice. Yeah, he's in he's in deep, but we in the episode with with Kevin and Betty and Charles where Kevin does say that he'll tell them. But given the fake information and find out where the farm is located. It looks like they're located at some Hotel on the other side of the maple Barons right there. Hold up of the bunch of arms and they're ready to make a stand. Yeah, so I guess I'm gonna have to go by what Kevin saying especially what we saw in a previous next week, right?	
1	Yes.	
3	Okay, we believe you for now Kevin, we're still suspicious then but you know, what, you don't want are suspicious of though. We are never suspicious of our fantastic fans.	
1	We are never suspicious Frank. Oh my God, I loved that dude. So hey guys before we move on to our next topic.

3	In love with very true very true. There's so many so many platforms here with so many great shows.	
1	So many I can't even keep up.	
3	That's true. I have a whole list that I keep it. It's just like it's like pushing a stone up a mountain. It's a stock so many new great host and great shows. Yeah. So we've also got our boy Jughead check it for site there where he's being kind of wooed recruited by a stone wall prep. Hmm. We're we got mister. Cheating's played by Sam Witwer. Yeah, if you're a big fan of Smallville, he was on there or if you big fan of the Clone Wars, he was the voice of Darth Maul on the show that show but now play mr. Kidding.	
1	I'm excited on it.	
3	I think Jughead needs to go, you know, it needs to go but I felt like the the show really laid it on heavy-handed that like, yeah. This is the Stonewall prep is a bunch of bunch of tools. Go to Stonewall prep. Mmm one way Mister. Ding says hey just come over for a tour and hook them up with Brett man. Could you not think of like a worse person to set you up with for a tour?	
1	It was named Brett.	
3	I mean it-it's just he was so obnoxious. Like how is that going to sell me? I'm going to your school having to talk to this really obnoxious guy, right?	
1	I mean, they're just giving you a feel for the school. I guess. That's all the amenities.	
3	Yes, really? I mean certainly I mean I was on a talk about like how amazing that you know all the stats for the school. How incredible it is it all but I'll but also the teachers write a touch except for mr. Shitting. He gets it and that just because he's right coming up right behind me. Yeah, but I thought Brett was the worst tour guide that you could have to get somebody to go like yeah, this thing's cool. Yeah, I'll go to the school.	
1	Especially Jughead who doesn't really, you know Vibe with those kinds of personalities, you know, he's more of a loner Saudi had to put someone like Brett with him is little shocking.	
3	So he does go to a salon the following day where they get her. Talk about Moby Dick.	
1	I've never Read Moby Dick, you know, I was supposed to don't tell my ninth-grade literary T-shirt.	
3	Oh, I am sure you're watching that great literary teacher. She definitely is. Oh busted. Yeah. I never read it. I've never seen any. Any of the films like with Gregory Peck, I've never read The Cliff Notes here and tell you like call me Ishmael. That's the only thing that I got a whale right? Yeah, that's right, but they do this lawn and Judkins able to drop a little knowledge there which seems to like shut up the rest of the people in the class head like Brett. It's just sitting like I want to like tell him he's wrong but I mean he quoted he quoted him. All right? No, I totally	
1	we agree. Yeah, I brought with his face was like like yeah want to say something to you, but I know that it's not going to be right.	
3	So yeah, so it's like and Jughead loves it because I well he loves it because he tells everybody back at Riverdale High. It's like yeah to hang out with people that are actually Read Moby Dick, but I'm also thinking like well so far out of that Salon we never really saw much of anything with some people griping about having to read it and then we saw Brett being frustrated because Jagged butter pie. Point right really hear anything else from any other student made me think like yeah, these guys are it was really in-depth discussion about Moby Dick right?	
1	There was no discussion. There was just Jugheads comment.	
3	I've been at all like quieter down after that and then we left he left the scene, but just to make sure that make jacket sediments like not want to do this FPS like yeah, you should go to do this and then it comes down to a class where everybody's in and the teacher comes out with a summer reading. And I don't know. I've never had a teacher in high school. Give me summer reading.	
1	No, I know that, you know extra credit but never mandatory so she decides to read and it's really dull Glacier Pace.	
3	Yes, and then Betty doesn't matter which I know I would never have the guts to do is to walk out in the middle of the class while the teacher standing up there reading it's senior year baby.	
1	Like what do you want from that?	
3	Well, they just walk a come with me. We're gonna walk out right now the fact that she's doesn't say anything. She just keeps reading and let's say go like what kind of cheese is cheese checked out. I know we both looked at each other like oh, wow. I mean, it's Day 2 Day 3 and already checked out late the first day left class the second day. So by the end of the episode that he decides he's going to go to Stonewall good.	
1	Yes. Yeah. I can't wait to see what all these crazies do over there.

Also, make sure you follow us. You never miss an episode of AfterBuzz TV now speaking of crazy though. We don't have to go all the way to Stonewall prep to find crazies. Sometimes it's as close as one of our best friends and their father because we do get to see Reggie. We saw a little bit of a last season when he showed up by talking to them after they brought up the the gold Griffin and gargoyles game. He showed up talking about the other Shiner that we had from his dad. This time he's got another one and we get to see Reggie being belittled by is that a football practice?	
1	Yeah that came out a little left field. Gotta say I did not think that that storyline would happen. I was wondering where he had the black guy last episode. I'm honestly excited though that they're also bringing more light to Reggie's life because we only ever knew him as Veronica's like boy toy basically, so it's good to see that there's a	
3	actually some you know dense stuff behind him and it's very sad though to see abuse though, you know it is but then this feel like him turn my head or special segment here for a moment boy. It's okay, but it also brings it back to my frustration at times of this show where we get to see Reggie Evans kind of Ferris Bueller moment or I like Cameron. I'm sorry, he's camera moment from Ferris Bueller work takes it out on his dad's car because they never pay them any attention. Right and that's how he's going to show them and so Reggie doesn't same thing with the baseball bat to his dad's prized car and then we just cut to later where it's are cheating with Richie. Well, you know it started as talking like I think I rather would have seen that scene.	
1	Yeah, I honestly didn't I wanted to talk about this too and then that segment but I honestly I feel like that's a lie. Like I don't just from what we've seen and how he said his dad never talked to him before all of a sudden you smash his car window and he's ready to open up to you and talk to you and listen to you. It just I don't know. It seems a little far-fetched to me. I don't know if maybe he was just deflecting and didn't want to talk about it or if it really is true.	
3	I'm I mean you hope for Reggie that it is true. But I mean, we'll probably never going to see his dad again. So we'll just to take his word for it. So sure Dad Mark game in one episode and speaking of dads. We do have wrapping up our core for storylines. We do have Veronica dealing with Paparazzi. Yes, as well as Hiram kind of saying hey, you know what it was Veronica. She was the one that did it and I took the fall for everything that she did very ballsy and he's now giving up his mija like what's going on?	
1	On I thought like I know like large family over everything besides maybe Hermione, but that's his daughter and I'm a little shocked that I'm like 90% shock 10% not shocked because it's like mr. Lodge, but I didn't think he would maybe stoop that low to throw his daughter under the bus again.	
3	Yeah, I'm not surprised anything that I room does at this point, but we end the episode because Kind of figure out what's gonna be the hook for this season and we've got see see some tantalizing things Cheryl. Mr. Honey. What's going to happen with Reggie news Ted that certainly tantalizing hook, you know, Alice and the farm and Charles and Betty, but it ends up being at least the flash for we get at the end of the episode is to spring break and we see everybody's searching for Jughead after he says I'm going to Stonewall it's gonna be great.	
1	Oh my God, that just gave me flashbacks to when he got beat up so bad that he almost died in a bush. That's not funny. But it is I don't know. I'm getting like flashbacks. I'm like, is he gonna be really dead this time?	
3	Like, I don't know. I mean I saw that I mean at the end of last season they burned his beanie look prep boys.	
1	Don't mess around. They're rich and their parents can cover stuff up. So	
3	Well after my brain went, you know, I feel like it's time for us to do the hottest new special segment. Yes, Riverdale Riverdale rants guys, but I can so yeah.	
1	Remember Duran's guys where we talk about one thing from the episode that really grinded our gears and we just really need to Hash it out. Out right here for you guys. You have one I did we did sort of touch on it, but it was Reggie and his storyline. Well bringing his father in I feel like I should be more sensitive about this, but honestly, I'm just like, where is this coming from? It's very left field. And again, like is this just going to go away and then we don't see Mark for like eight episodes and he randomly comes back in.	
3	Yeah. It's The frustrating thing about the show my I am torn between two rants, but I guess I'll go with my second one and that is having to do with Veronica because you at the end of the her story arc for this episode. She goes art. I'm finally going to make a stand the paparazzi are right outside her door when how they even got into Riverdale High terrible, especially for a new team new principal that's all about order and discipline and they came from all different angles. It's already mr. Honey, you've failed but they show up at veronika's home and she slams The Door in the compose herself for a moment and then opens it up and says, you know, I'm only going to give one statement and it's going to be the beginning and end of anything I have to say, but I'll only do it at Le Bon Nuit Speakeasy and there will be a special performance after they will have a press conference after my performance. So we have these poor journalist, but I can't I mean I can't say poor journalist because there's the other just invading a high school, you know senior year high school students life to get whatever salacious Coop they are. They're dirty. They're Sleazy and there's coming. Okay sure, but they also that it's so self-indulgent a Veronica to say you come and watch me saying all that jazz and then I'll tell you what you need to hear. Look she's a business lady.	
1	She got her suffer audience and maybe she made a little bit of Revenue while they were there.	
3	Oh, I was like, come on. Yeah, that was a little like wow why so So awful so awful so awful. I mean hot second mini 10-second Riverdale rant was also when we see they set up Kevin to go find Fang to give them, you know to lure him out. So Kevin kind of came this false information, but nobody's there except for Betty. Why isn't the FBI than just following Fang so they can find it until it takes all the rest of the episode for Fang to get release that information.	
1	Well, you see this is why I have my suspicions about Charles. What the heck is Charles doing in the basement? Is he really? With the FBI, this is badge. Fake Betty. Did you do your research on him?	
3	Those are hot Riverdale rants. So if you've got a rant turmoil in the chat or leave a comment down below. We'd love to hear what what made you want to rant this? Yes as we're getting wrap up though. I you know, I guess I we can I do a little bit of predictions everyday almost ran out, so Stevie predictions So many things have been set up this this episode for the season. What is what is something that you feel you're going to be seeing?	
1	I'm very excited for the Stonewall prep people. I want to get to know them. I want to get to see all these crazies over there. I want to know the dynamic that that are going to happen with Jughead while he's there. I don't know. I'm ready for those prep boys, but girls I want to see what's going on over there and That bread yo Brett's not too hard to look at those. He cannot be all Moody all he wants but he looks good while doing it. Also, I really feel like Alice isn't danger. I feel like she's being held hostage. And that maybe Edgar found out about her little deal with the FBI.	
3	All right. All right. Yeah me boy. I won't it doesn't seem like it's a hard prediction to make that night. Everything is not on the up and up with mr. Chitting. I'm sure there's going to be something every sort of kind of Mentor figure almost invariably ends up having some kind of dark secret about them that's going to drag Jughead down and it's going to lead into this whole big thing that happened somehow in spring break. Where'd you get ends up missing damn you. Mr. Trump calling it now damn you folks that's gonna do it for this episode of the river to laughter show time flies when you break it down a fun show like this.
