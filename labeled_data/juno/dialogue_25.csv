1	Hi guys, I'm TJ brow. And this is talks with TJ a podcast. I'm doing to talk about life writing and being mixed race as many of you know, my debut young adult novel The Cross will be published this spring at the very latest. So please be sure to follow me on social media for updates promotions and to see if I'm coming to your city on my book tour. I'm on Twitter @ TJ brow author and Instagram at T dot j dot proud author. And if you have a Facebook, I'm on there too. I can't wait to get to know you a little better if you have any topics you'd like me to talk. Chon or any questions, please. Don't hesitate to contact me on social media first before we begin as always my producer Casey is here. Say hello. Hello. Thank you. Also my manager so yes wears a lot of hats not literally. She looks bad in hats. Hey, anyway, second thing I didn't say that second thing. I would like to talk about very briefly what this article is today. What we're going to do is we're going to read this article 7. Things not to say to mixed race people. We're not going to read the whole article. Just what those seven things are and I'm going to State my opinion on those seven things. I want to make very clear like I did in the first episode. My opinions are just my opinions. Your opinions are very valid. If you do not agree with what I am saying, you do not have to listen to it. You can just stop the podcast throw your phone against a wall, whatever you have to do refer you to keep listening. We'd prefer you to keep listening to go we get it. Yes, we prefer to keep listening and we prefer that you don't break your phone. But if you have two you gotta do what you gotta do. So there's that all I'm saying is I have had a very I've had a very interesting life being mixed, but I'm extremely positive and a huge advocate for multiracial people. So I tend to be more positive when looking at this subject and looking how people approach it. But some people have had a very different experience than me and that's what shapes people so if your experience has been different actually reach out to me on social media, I'd love to know I always like to stay Least ignorant that I can be so if you have had a completely different experience being mixed or you want to know more about being mixed, please again contact me on social media, please like the Facebook page everyone like the Facebook page follow us on everything. Anyway, we already said this so this is irrelevant. So this article is by Maya gentlemen, I'm so sorry. If I said your name wrong Maya and the first thing we're going to dive in right now. If I didn't say that earlier, the first thing she says is a ridiculous thing to say to mixed race people is what are you she explains that this is because and I quote our identities are not Curiosities small talk talking points or tokens. You don't know what her background means to us. We don't owe you anything. I I feel like I don't know how to put those. I feel like the question. What are you gets asked to more than just the mixed Community.	
2	Yes. I've noticed that as well.	
1	It's something I think people want to know many times if they relate to you or they have a friend that looks similar to you just to start a conversation.	
2	Maybe not even talk.	
1	Reese yes exactly like this is that is a good point when people ask me what army what army I'm not going to stop the podcast because we're too deep but what army anyway when people say what are you to me? I have to think for a moment because I'm confused unless the context makes sense. I am like are they asking me if I'm a dog mom? Are they asking me if I'm a Christian are they asking? Asking me if I'm a Frog all of which I am all of which I really am so and identify us. So if they ask me that question, I'm not going to immediately think of ethnicity sometimes I do because because of the contacts am because I know people are curious about mixed people but so what would be a better question than what are you? I think that if you want to know someone's ethnicity, please just say What if you don't mind me asking? What is your ethnicity that way if they do mind you asking they'll say I don't want to talk about it and then you can just say okay and move on and then you didn't offend them because you were very clear that you were not trying to put them as like a like she said small talk or talking point in your conversation. So yeah, I just think it's a confusing question in general sometimes even you could.	
2	Like wait because sometimes a normal conversation they if they are mixed or if they are a certain race normally if they are really into their culture that will like come up and then you'll figure it out that way to exactly wait a solid 20 minutes anyway, so that was not real.	
1	I just made that up. So second thing that's so cool. She doesn't like when people say that's so cool about her race because and I quote don't glance at what you don't understand and reduce it to cool. We are not a curiosity. This one. I read a lot of the comments this this article was somewhat viral within the mixed Community. There were a lot of mixed reviews about it in case you're wondering very funny. Yes. Thank you. My Patronus is a 50 year old dad. So so all I'm saying is there were some comments where people believed a lot of her answers were wrong on behalf of the mix Community. A lot of people believed it was right. It's somewhere in between I think with that's so cool. Personally. It depends on how the person says it because it could be condescending but 99% of the time I've said my race and someone says that's so cool. It's because they don't meet a lot of people like me they're panicked, but they want to convey to me that they support that about me and it's not something that makes them uncomfortable. Because right now currently I guess it's 2020 right now. So I lied last year the 2019 US Census showed that there was two point seven percent of Americans that identified as two or more races. That's it. There could be more of course, but if that sense this is to be more or less true. There are not a lot of us in the u.s. So when people come across us, they probably are just Searching frantically for anything they can say to make us feel comfortable and like they aren't judging us or assuming things about us. So then that's so cool blurts out their mouth. That's not exactly I don't take that as something offensive because I understand I think a lot of this is about empathy you guys. I understand not wanting to be a curiosity but I think you really should put yourself in that person's shoes and understand that. That we are still in the minority vary greatly in the minority. So we need to just educate them. We need to help them understand being mixed race and how how much of a I don't even know how to put this just three-dimensional thing. That is there's so many layers to it because you're a person exactly and that's so cool doesn't always have to be an insult or doesn't always have to be someone being Karin it could just be that they have no idea how to Broach this because I live in the south and this I've heard this that's so cool a lot and I have not once thought this person is reducing me to cool. I've just thought they are freaking out and don't know what to say to me. That's understandable, but they want me to know they're okay with it, and I appreciate that. So next thing again, that's just my opinion next thing. Okay. I have a lot of opinions about this next one. That's so hot. She says don't say this because mixed people do not exist to turn you on we each belong to ourselves. Then she goes on to talk about how mixed race people have been perceived as hyper sexualized in the media what she has proof of she is not wrong about this one. This one has I have no excuse for someone who says the words. That's so hot about being mixed race. It doesn't make sense. It's pretty gross. It's very gross. It's it feels not only offensive but it makes us feel like we're being objectified that make sense and I don't like it at all because we are people at our core we are not different than our souls are the same. So please don't say that's so hot. It makes me scared that you're fetishizing mixed people. Oil and and most of the time they are if they say something like that. Also, this is just like a side note a side quick story that TJ's going to tell because she is a person that Rambles it's her podcast. It's my podcast. So you have to listen to me or throw your phone against the wall. We don't know but basically recently I was talking to this guy who is of mixed race as well and explaining to him that the word exotic is triggering.	
2	Exactly because we're just reminds me of like animals like right from other countries right rare.	
1	That's what people use exotic for right? That's what I like animals are like food. I don't know but when you say it a person exactly I was explaining to him because I don't know if this doesn't happen to a lot of mixed guys, but he I don't think he had ever been called exotic. So I was trying to explain how that was a red flag word. He didn't use it. So please don't think that he's a Guy, but that's good. I was explaining that it's a little bit of a trigger word because nine out of ten times if someone who is romantically interested in me calls me Exotic then about 20 minutes later. I find out that they are creepily fetishizing me because I mixed so it is not a great word to call someone not because it's the worst word in the world to call someone but because it's which it's not I mean it isn't great but It usually leads to a deep-seated issue in how that person is perceiving me big red flag. Exactly. It is a red flag. So people that are not mixed, please don't use this word in any capacity to a mix person, please no one uses to any person ever. Yes. It makes us feel like animals. It's very that you want to talk about. Oh my gosh, you want to talk about patronizing it just it feels very objectifying. So please don't use that word. I'm begging you people that are mixed. Storm watch out for that word. If you have not heard it before even mixed boys. I know he had never heard it. I think again I could be wrong. He probably is heard that so hot though, like the probably probably and so look out for those trigger words because you don't want to be with someone who only likes you because of your the fact that you're different and you're in the minority you want someone who likes you for your beautiful mind and your heart and your soul and every awesome thing. You are so mixed people. Please remember that and have pride in that so number 4. Everyone should / will be more like you one day. She doesn't like when people say this to her because and I quote please don't speak with patronizing Authority about what you barely understand. There's that word again. And again this go back goes back to the problems of that's so cool. First of all, I want to apologize for how I read that my eyes stopped. And then my mouth that's all that matters my mouth stopped working. So I got through it and I think you guys kind of got the gist. I'm sorry if you didn't but I completely understand where she's coming from. I get that it feels patronizing sometimes I think it goes back again with that. So cool to the way they say it that makes sense.	
2	It's another like tone fries.	
1	Yes. It's another tone type phrase the I get you I gave you. Let's just say that okay and when people have said this to me before It'll be like I'll say there's not a lot of us in they'll say well everyone should be more like you or everyone will be more like, you know, so it's kind of like another way that they're like, I'm okay like you being mixed is great.	
2	Like I don't think there's anything wrong with it.	
1	I believe her. Okay, I believe so and this I'm going to go off on a real quick thing right now. This goes back to the fact that you know earlier I said the 2019 US Census thing. Yes that set so I know that a lot of people we I didn't know about This at first but this is not me ragging on President Obama or saying he was a terrible president or something or a bad guy, but he caused a lot of controversy within the mix Community because when he was first running, I don't know that he still does this but I know at one point he on the census checked that he was black and not of two or more races when he is completely the same amount white that he is black like there is no overlap. He's not Like a corridor white or something, so that caused a lot of problems in the mixed Community because they were very frustrated. They were like, why are you ashamed of being both or should I be ashamed of being both should I pick which one people are deciding that I look more like that kind of thing exactly. So it was a problem because now I think a lot of people this is why I believe there are more mixed people than the census of showing because they're they feel pressured to pick one. That makes sense. Exactly so there has been exactly because people label them as that. Yeah. I myself have been tempted like when I was much younger and more insecure in my identity to click just Asian on the you know, SATs and stuff because until recently I don't even know if they changed this but until recently, I believe you had to say other you can even say I'm two or more races you couldn't click for me white and Asian you had	
2	to say other and correct me if I'm wrong on the senses, even you couldn't say you were two races or more until like what 2005 right?	
1	Yeah, so it's really recent exactly. So Obama obviously said he was black after this after that fact, which is why he caused controversy, but I can't even blame him when everyone's calling him the first black president not the first mixed-race president. Yeah as he is, so I understand he's black, but if people said the first I don't know Indian president if I were the president, which please don't ever elect me. I'm a mess. But if they were to say that I would be very hurt because I would feel like that is completely taking away my mom from me that's weird, but it would feel like that Irish part of me is gone and I would be completely remiss if that happened because that woman raised me and I'm very proud of being Irish American. So also my dad raised me shout out to my My dad, I'm so sorry APPA so so both press they were both present but saying everyone should / will be more like you one day and her saying that's patronizing Authority. It's really again that they don't meet many of us, even though I do believe there could be more of us and that and you guys are you are becoming more and more common if we are and it's amazing. And so that's probably one of the reasons why they're saying it and the other is historically Mixed people have felt a very oppressed even by their own people and that led to even the title of my book is my book title is called the crossed that was taken cross from a Langston Hughes poem that was written in I'm sorry if this is wrong 1926 and where he quote at the end says, I wonder where all died being neither black nor white so there's been a lot of identity issues in the next community. So this is basically probably just them saying I'm sorry kind of thing in their own way. Like I want you to know I support you so I don't think it's the most patronizing thing if they say it in the right way. I think it could just be them trying to say I'm not going to hate on you like you have historically been hated if that makes any sense. So the next one is number 5. I knew I saw some blank in you. So, for example, I knew I saw some Indian in you if someone said that to me, I think this one's kind of funny because I have not once in my life count. It guys not once then guests as Indian or like even close to Indian. I get Greek I get Sicilian I get any kind of Hispanic or Latino I get everything and then I'm actually cotton. I've actually gotten Filipino before really yeah. I was actually really surprised that one I've gotten Filipino. I've got a Native American. I got a Native American a lot which is weird because Indian thanks Columbus anyway, so I'm just saying I get that a lot and then when I tell them what I actually am, they'll go. Oh, I knew I saw some Indian in you and I'm like no you didn't it's like no you did it. I'm sorry. When is the last time someone confused Ariana Grande & Mindy Kaling? Like I'm just saying like don't call me Cecilia. And then be like, I knew you were an Indian so it's just kind of funny to me. Honestly like it's not even like yeah, I guess don't say it probably but it is really funny Jelly's they're just trying to save themselves from looking kind of dumb. I think they're just embarrassed again. This is all about empathy you guys. Alright so number six. You don't really count / you're not really this one is not good guys. Like do not say this to people don't ever say to me. You're not really Indian or you Count as being Irish American because I am both I am two halves and I'm a whole being and I am very educated and very much so celebrate both of those cultures. My grandfather calls me the most patriotic of his grandchildren because G hand. So that means Victory to India in case you're wondering so I'm just saying I love both parts of me and I don't think I'm any less of one, but I have heard this consistently. Throughout my life and is very frustrating to me sounds frustrating.	
2	Exactly. Even I'm not mixed everyone. I'm just white if someone was like you're not your race. I wouldn't even know how to respond I'd be like, well I am like, what do you what else?	
1	Do you want me to say? Yes, it makes sense. And if you say this to people by the way guys, it'll give them a little bit of a night an identity crisis and be like, well then what am I exactly they'll think what I am I and that what am I that makes people go through and struggle ends up with a really terrible thing that happens, which is they start to get vocal about it asking what I am I and then which is a very valid thing and then people who are of One race hear that and then they're like, oh the poor mixed kids and then they tell their children or whoever to not interracially date because then their children will have a hard time which by the way if you think that that's an archaic way of thinking because at some point in their life ever, One has an identity crisis no matter what race they are as a human. That's why people go through angsty teenage phases. I'm sorry. It's true. So that should not be a reason why you should not I date someone of another race do not stop yourself from being in love with someone because of their skin color because you're afraid of they're your children having a hard time in life. Like that's kind of everyone at some point has a hard time in life life is hard, but we get through it and we get proud. So please do not use that as an excuse It's 2020. Let's act like it. Thank you and then seven think I can't even tell there. She's saying remember each mix person is unique and none of us owe you anything. We don't conform to your assumptions about what makes people look or behave that's not our problem. It's yours. So say someone said I can't even tell your Indian I again don't think that's a defensive. I think they're again, they don't know how to react because they're panicked. But yeah, that's That's honestly and I'm not going to go over because we're kind of running out of time here. But again, I think that goes back to half of these.	
2	Yeah, exactly.	
1	Exactly. So with that guys, this has been the third episode of this podcast seven ridiculous things not to say to mixed race people by Maya gentlemen, go ahead and read it if you'd like. It's actually very interesting article and very well written and I will say I again that these are my opinions But that I wouldn't say any of these things to mixed-race people in general because clearly half of the people who read this were very hurt by things that these said, right and because all mixed race people are different just because I understand where you're coming from when you say this doesn't mean someone else will so please keep that in mind guys. Be careful what you say to makes people and makes people please remember to have empathy for people that are of One race and say these things because a lot of times they don't know how to respond in a supportive way that's eloquent. So they just kind of panic and say whatever if they say that's so hot in your exotic run run away. But other than that, yeah, yes, and so anyway, this has been this podcast. Please hit me up on social media, like I said earlier and buy my book when it comes out because it's going to have stuff like this all over it. So, thank you for joining us again, and we'll see you next week.	
2	Bye everyone. Bye.
