1	Good morning, good evening. Good afternoon good whatever and welcome to another episode of role model. You've come to the right place. If you want to become a happier and more successful human being in after today's episode. You're going to be a happier and more successful human being why because we're going to talk about the subconscious mind the subconscious mind records everything. Like first of all, we have two minds the subconscious mind and the conscious mind this subconscious mind. I think we should focus more on definitely why I will let you know the subconscious mind records everything no matter if you are awake or asleep, the tape is running 24/7. The subconscious mind is always alert and awake. Like when you fall asleep in front of the TV your subconscious mind, he is everything that is being said like every single I could and now. This fact is so important the subconscious mind controls 91st percent 90 percent of our Lives 95% is happening on autopilot habits, and that also means that only 5% Is controlled by our conscious mind? So we should figure out. How to influence our subconscious mind and dr. Bruce Lipton will do that today because a biologist as Speaker author and this full speech is just incredible. I learned so much from it. I'm sure you will too and as always don't forget to take action just feeling inspired doesn't really help. It's just a beautiful feeling you want to do something like you want to change. Change stuff. I don't know you there are probably thousand things you can change in your life. Just pick one and really do it. You feel like you want to start meditating do it. You feel like you want to start reading books before you go to bed because you're going to learn how important it is what you do before you go to bed and what you do after you wake up, like one hack that I have for you before you go to bed. Write down like literally ask yourself. What am I looking forward to tomorrow? Just write it down like on a piece of paper. It's going to create Magic. It's like the day before Christmas. We can create Christmas like every single day. We are so excited for the next day like just try to remember when you were a child. The day before Christmas you were freaking out you couldn't wait to wake up. You were so excited energetic and you can create that in your mind every single day just just requires a little bit of discipline, but our don't want to rent here for too long. Dr. Bruce Lipton will tell you what to do.	
3	This is the bigger Monkey Wrench in the system and that is We had started off with the fundamental belief that the conscious and subconscious were just the unity of a single mind. So if the conscious mind became aware of something then the subconscious mind should of course follow along with it as well because they're both to gather two separate minds, but they learn in different ways. Here's the critical part conscious mind being creative can learn in a creative fashion conscious mind can read a self-help book and after one reading go. Oh, yeah. I've been educated. I know how this I should do it this way. My life could be really good if I understood this and then you say well, I just read the book and I understand how it all works and yet my life is still exactly the same. You can go to the lecture. You can read the book. You can watch the video. You can even just go a ha and the conscious mind being creative can learn just from Simply that read the book and learned I go what about subconsciously I here's your problem. It's a habit mine. I said, well, how do you create a habit of reading the book once it's not a habit. So what's the point the self-help book you read was picked up information-wise educated and enhanced your conscious awareness and yet didn't touch any of your subconscious programs. You have the same behavior you had before you read the book after you're at the bar quite conscious mind learns by reading the book subconscious habit. You don't learn from that one reading of the book. So the conscious mind subconscious mind learn in different ways. How can I teach the subconscious mind number one so many of us talk to ourselves, you know, I love donuts Margaret. My partner calls some Circles of death, but I you know, I love those guys and and of course my health, wasn't that great at this time? And so my programming is don't eat donuts don't eat donuts. And I keep talking to myself. Don't eat the donut. Don't eat the donut and then sure enough five minutes later. There's a doughnut in my hand and it's about halfway finished when my mind catches on. Oh my God, you're eating a donut. Well now being so upset why you might as well finish it down. Then I eat a doughnut. Okay, and I go wow this I kept talking to myself not to eat the donut. Why did I eat the donut? And here's the fun answer the conscious mind. Yes, you're in. In it. Remember I said that's a seed of your identity your spirit your Consciousness. That's where you are. Oh, then who's in the subconscious mind to go? Nobody? There's nobody in there. It's a machine like a CD recorder. Why is that relevant? Well, let's say I record a program on a CD put it in the Machine push play in a place the program and I say I don't like that program. So I say okay CD player change the program make something more fun and something I would like better than this program. Then of course the program continues to play chess. The was and then you get a little more upset. Come on. I please change the program. I asked you to change the program. Don't eat the doughnuts. Don't you? Remember I said that still leaving here at Dona I go I get very frustrated and very upset with myself. And then I really almost give up because how many times do I have to tell myself not to eat the donut still end up eating done it to realize it's not making any difference at all the point about it is this when your conscious mind was telling your subconscious not to eat the donut. Who were you expecting to hear that message and then you realize there's nobody in a Subconscious the machine so I say yeah go talk to the CD player is playing a track on an album. I say okay. Tell it to play something different just talk to it and the answer it's not going to change. They'll never change I go ye out. There's your problem trying to talk yourself in a change is not going to work because the subconscious mind has nobody to listen to your story. So I said well, how does it change a so how does it learn and here's the three things to rewrite your subconscious number one. How did it learn in the first seven years the programmable period I say oh the brain was in a low vibrational frequency called Theta which is hypnosis. So if I use hypnosis, I can download a program because yes, you can that's how you can do it I go do I have to have somebody else do the hypnosis on Mango, you know, here's the fun part. The vibration of theta is a low vibrations below Consciousness, which is Alpha and a higher vibration analysis beta which is like School room studying, you know work mind work Consciousness and I saw there's higher Cos beta the next one down is more calm is Alpha when you go down below Alpha Theta which is the hypnosis or imagination phase as well because children in that Theta period for seven years mix the real world than the imaginary world seamlessly and that's because Theta is imagination and reality mix and then below Theta is a one lower vibration called Delta, which is absolute sleep. I say what significant I said. Well every day when you wake up you're coming. Going from Delta to the lowest vibration just as you're waking up in the morning just as you're coming out of sleep the immediate like groggy period that beginning that's Theta that's where imagination and hypnosis and reality start to mix together. So guess what every day when you're going to bed or when you're waking up you go through a zone of theta naturally from sleep vibration Delta the lowest to waking up you have to go through Theta Theta is Imagination so guess If you put earphones on and play a program as you're going to bet just as your conscious mind, let's go and it's not paying attention to the program at this point. You're really going off into sleep. Theta is engaged and what state is doing taking the program and downloading it into the subconscious mind cuz that's what they'd it does if gnosis bypassing the conscious mind which just went to sleep. So every night putting air in earphones and playing a program of behavior that you want to create in your life repetition of that every night. Then manifest that experience. So the first seven years hypnosis Theta Auto hypnosis with earphones I said and going to bed. That's where you can program it a number two. What about programming after age seven I go. Oh well, then the conscious Minds working so you how do I put a new program and I say you practiced you repeated something over and over and over again making a habit out of it. I say you want to learn ABC. How many times did you start with ABC and I get to a certain point and then stop because you Know what was next and then you thought about what was next A B C D E. ABCDE. Next one is of' and you keep adding and what are you doing repeating and repeating finally get ABCD XYZ got to the end. Guess what you got to the end. You don't have to do it anymore. Why you repeated? It made a habit out of it. Now. It's enclosed in the habit mind. You can just call it up. It's already a habit. So repetition. Let's say oh you find that your behaviors are not supporting you then guess what generated behavior that represents supporting you and repeat it just like a player on a sporting team go out and do the practice just repeat it and repeat it repeat it. Even if it's not real at the time it will become real as it becomes downloaded as a program. Your subconscious will take that program and then use it to manifest life from it. So you start out you might be sick with cancer and your program is on. I am healthy. I control my health couple of those programs like that very positive thinking like that. I say won't happens. Well, it's very hard for your conscious mind is say I am healthy knowing you were having a cancer right now. I say no that's not the issue you're repeating it over and over again for what the subconscious the repetition habituation occurs. The subconscious now gets a program. What's the program? I am healthy the function of the mind is to create call. Coherence between your programs and your reality so though if I put in a program that I am healthy and at that moment, I have sick with cancer. What do you think the function of my mind is is to create an environmental situation where Health can be restored. Why because my program says I'm healthy. My biology says I'm not the function of mind is to adjust the biology. So it manifested expression of the program. I can heal myself, but now with my conscious mind that's good positive thinking I go. Yeah positive thing I can heal myself. Am I said I said and how much of the day are you using that positive thinking less than 5% Oh, it's not going to have much of an effect. You want to have an effect put in the subconscious make a program and operate 95% of the day. So the two fundamental ways right now of learning are the two fundamental ways that we acquired the subconscious programs a hypnosis first seven years be repetition of a practice or a pattern which occurs after a seven. How do you drive a car? You didn't know how to drive it when you first got in you practiced. And you experience all of the aspects of driving. So now you get in the car you've been driving for a while. You don't even think of the mechanics of the driving part. You put the key in the ignition, you're already thinking about where you're going in a destination. All this now is automatic subconscious programming and you can turn any aspect of life into that automatic subconscious program being in love to be a subconscious program. I said, why is it relevant? Well, whether you're just stop and consciously say God, I'm so happy and I'm in love or just walking down the street. It was white because that's what my subconscious mind says. I live that most of us and I've seen this in our belief courses 80 to 90% of every audience does not love themselves. No self love how can that be and the answer was simple because what are the programs in that child's mind for the first seven years I go. Well a psychologist said 70% or so and negative redundant disempowering self-sabotage and go. Well. How'd they get there and say Here's the primary reason parents act like Coaches I said was it coach. Well, here's a team players not performing grow its not putting out the effort and so the coach goes. Oh, come on, you're not deserve to be on this team. Who do you think you are? You're not that good. Why is the coach saying that just to piss off the player know the player is now thinking oh my God, I got to perform better. I'm going to work harder. I'm going to do better because I want to show the coach that I am deserving of this. So the consciousness of the player is understanding what the coach meant because the coach said you're not good enough. Consciousness is an interpretation. I'm not good enough because I'm not performing. Well therefore I will perform. Well I go. Yeah, but that's when the student or whatever it is is conscious I say what about a child before seven say, oh, they're not conscious. They're recording. I say, oh if a parents acting like a coach, what did the child just record not good enough not deserving. Who do you think you are? You're not that good at this you're not lovable. These are things our parents say, why did they say them because they wanted to be the coach. And say come on you can do better, you know needle them to do better. It only works. If the child is conscious enough to understand the meaning if the child is under 7, they're just recording the words. I said woe to the words recorded in this child's mind not good enough not deserving not lovable not worthy. These are the programs of subconscious mind. But yeah, and I said what happened if that mine plays 95% of the time. Oh, what's the function of the Mind? the program and create behavior that will you know make coherence between the resulting life and the program program is not good enough not worthy not deserving then guess what the behavior is going to come from the Mind any behavior that will show outside people that a I'm not good enough not worthy or deserving because my behavior will be coherent with the program and this is why between 80 to 90% of the people in our workshops will not S+ to I love myself because the fundamental programs are critical self-critical and I go why is that relevant program? I am not lovable issue a partner shows up who says they love you. They say they love you. What is your mind thinking at that moment? What is your subconscious mind? Yeah possibly be true. Good to be true. I'm not I know I'm not lovable. So how the hell can I say that? What will you do? You will push away? Of because you can't accept it for yourself. So when someone else says it can't be true. And therefore you will always be seeking love and never find it conscious mind wishes and desires. Yes. I want that love Yeah, 5% of the day 95% of time. You're not worthy. You don't deserve this. Who do you think you are and all of a sudden like, oh my god, of course if that's running 95% day. I'll never be successful and why am I worried about it now? Answer is because that 95% of the day it's not visible to me. So if I'm sabotaging myself 95% of the day with programs that will push away everyone who loves me and then at the end of the day come home and say I can't find a mate. No one loves me. It's like no didn't start there it started with you. You didn't love you. No one else can love you.
