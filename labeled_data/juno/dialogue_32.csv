3	All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to rock star 101. His name is Brandon. He's the deejay. His name is Jim. He's the rock star class is in session. And as we left off on the last episode, we were talking about crazy things that have happened on the road and kind of what sparked this conversation was something that the hit the internet it was a while ago now at a behemoth show where the band was up on stage I believe. One of the members was filming and as he's filming the crowd you see what looks like a mosh pit, you know, it's a group of people like, you know, the big circle, you know, and it's just kind of an empty space But as he Zooms in you realize that's not a mosh pit. It's a fallacious act happening in the middle of these people which is why they have separated from this group that's in the middle of this kind of empty space. So I figured this was a good way to kind of spark the topic of what some of the	
2	Crazy Road stories, maybe some stories about things that people don't know which brings me to my Papa Roach story. I'm not really sure how crazy the story is, but we learned something that day and I was wondering if you the the story that we have if it's something that you do as well when you're on the road or if it's like a one-off thing because we were made to believe that this thing that happened at Papa Roach every single band does.	
1	Yeah, like a spinal tap moment that happens to every man will tell me this. Actually, I've got a story but in the back of my head ready for after when you're done, but I got a feeling your story is going to take us off on a tangent. So tell me what happened.	
2	I most likely so the Papa Roach show. This was back in 2004. I think it was either 2004 2005. I was living in Eugene, Oregon and they were in town for a concert and when we went to the show that night we were given basically backstage passes that we didn't realize we're backstage passes. Oh, it's me and a few of my friends that work at the radio station and the whole time we're hanging out backstage after the concert and we're like well, how do we actually get backstage? Because the whole time were just standing behind the venue like a group of idiots just waiting like you to get their autograph when it's like we're trying to get back in there. So my one friend he knows one of the record reps and another guy knows somebody else or like they're on the phone trying to call people right now and then out of nowhere, one of the security guards walks up and he was like, what are you guys doing and well We're trying to see if we can connect with so and so or do you know this guy and he goes you guys have passes right? Now, you're wearing them just come back here and we had no clue. He's like, no just walk back here because that's what that sticker is. He goes the thing that you're wearing get you back here. So we're like, oh sweet. So we head on back were hanging out the band's kind of bouncing around. I can't remember who was playing with them that day but we get backstage wind up in the small room and the guy who led us back there. He's like, hey guys help yourself to the stuff, whatever you do. Don't touch that bottle of wine. But other than that, just kind of help. Off to some beers help yourself to some foods Tang out have some fun. So we're like cool and we're kind of keeping to ourselves were not you know interacting with other people. We're just kind of taking in the scenery if you will and so fast forward about 20 minutes all of a sudden we see their Road manager just kind of running around like a maniac back and forth back and forth back and forth and he has this big bag of tube socks like brand new tube socks that they had just purchased at I'm guessing Costco and the Her like well, this is weird this like what the hell you doing with those tube socks come to find out as we were talking with our boss the next day who's been in the radio business for 20 years longer than I have. He's like, yeah, he goes most bands just to have tube socks and what they do is they go buy a new package because they're cheap and it's easier and cheaper than having to do the laundry. So what they do is they just wear the one set of tube socks and then they just throw them away when they're done and it absolutely blew our minds which then sparked the the terminology of it rocks like tube socks, of course in our group of people, but now I want my question for you.	
3	Is this an actual thing or we lied to know that would definitely be a thing and I actually think that that's genius. I think that's total genius because I hate doing the laundry on my socks. I absolutely hate it. I hate it. I hate it because the socks and the reason is because the socks are the thing that stink out the bus more than anything if you've ever been on a bun. You were bus it stinks no matter what no matter how clean you try to keep it because you got five to ten sweaty ass guys or girls and you're sweating on stage and then you go to find somewhere to put this sweaty clothes every night you're sweating out your clothes and usually you get to a thing where you're like, you're freezing it and then you're hanging it up in the back Lounge in the back the the closet area or whatever is another closet is just this cesspit of horrible. Unk dead-body smell but you Febreze it. So now you got a dead body smell that he's covered in Febreze. They don't cancel each other out. They just multiply young. So I think I actually really I'm going to steal that I'm going to steal that idea because for me I travel around with a lie. I know it sounds silly but it's it really is like that Forrest Gump moment where Lieutenant Dan Lieutenant Dan says, like if you're in my platoon, you got to change your socks every time we stop because the you know the moment the Gang In the funk that can come up on your on your feet from walking through the water and blah blah blah is like change your socks every time we stop and it's true because if you don't after a while, I've had a couple of problems. Come on. I remember when I first started doing that a couple of problems come up with my feet with him. Just getting a little bit too funky because I wasn't paying attention to that and it actually makes perfect sense that you go and you buy a huge thing.	
2	It's what's the difference between tube socks and socks tube socks don't have a heel regular socks have that they're actually designed so that you can	
3	There's a specific spot where your heel goes right tube socks are basically a tube so you can almost put them on in any direction. Yeah. Yeah, that makes perfect sense because it doesn't matter you just done stays and then you check them out. No, it's a genius idea. I can't believe I've never thought of that. It's actually I'm actually kind of I feel like a bit of an idiot now.	
2	Yeah, so we had absolutely no clue that this occurred and so ever since then and this was you know, 15 years ago this point, it rocks like tube socks because we found out from Papa Roach that they were the ones, you know, the taught us about the band's basically Tube socks and then they just Chuck them after the fact because it's a lot easier than having to do the laundry. And then this was also the night. So as we are hanging out backstage and we're watching this guy with the tube socks. We didn't realize how much beer we had been drinking and so because we just kind of kept getting into the cooler and grabbing a beer and then it got to the point where we noticed that the beer was gone and my one friend looks at that bottle of wine. We were told don't touch this bottle of wine and he's like Matt he goes he's Do you think anybody would notice and I'm like, yeah, I think people are gonna notice man. That's like we're not we're not in a large room and it's not a small bottle of wine. Like it's not one of those little four pack bottles that you can get. It's a full bottle of wine. How are you going to hide that thing?	
3	So as we're having Specific Instructions Not to drink exactly.	
2	So as we're having this argument, I'm like dude don't touch the bottle of wine the drummer walks in and he grabs the bottle of wine and then he starts drinking and like well that solves that problem. We're not drinking a bottle of wine. I told you that man, right like that was that was for somebody whenever there's One item like that.	
1	Somebody has specifically requested that yeah, that's that's exactly what it is. That's if there's a you have it's funny how people think that like rock stars are rock stars because of this sort of finicky shit, but you have a section of stuff that you're like, hey, here's a 24-pack of Bud Light or whatever whatever that's just for people who are hanging out like hey like a like a college party or something like yo, there's The Keg there's the whatever but bands. You got a room like people don't really think about it very much. But I've had people to come over to America from Australia and they do a little road trip or whatever and they really look forward to getting a home cooked meal back home after being on the road for a couple of weeks just doing a holiday, right because you're having like Subway and deli trays or you know, like a service the the you go to the gas station and there's like a tuna sandwich or whatever and you got to make sure you Away from anything that Seafood if you're not within like a hundred miles of the coast and there's lots of little tricks and stuff at the trade. But I remember I remember hearing like Steve Tyler, but before I started touring on the road, right I saw an interview from back in the day with Steve Tyler and they were like, oh you guys are such crazy rock stars. Is it true that one time you flipped over a table of your Rider that had deli meats on it and because you asked for turkey on the bone, and it makes him Sound like a dick, right? It makes him sound like they didn't bring him his turkey on the bone and then he flips over the table now, obviously, I don't agree with flipping over the table, but he actually explained it and he was like, here's the reason why when you get a deli tray, it's just a tray on a random plate that's covered in plastic. You don't know where it's come from. You don't know how old it is. You don't know if it's fresh. You don't know how much crap they put in it. You don't know what brand it is and you're eating that every day. That's your that's your dinner every day. Is this Deli tray and sandwich stuff and you were going to make a set and that's that's what you get. Because you're playing somewhere. They're playing a rain is and you kind of just go out to you know, the local restaurant because you're Aerosmith and so his thing was like if I get a turkey on the bone, then I know that it's been made in the last day or so and it's been cooked today and it's fresh and it's like it's real food and I've got and he's like and I've got to eat every day. Like he and you kind of after I'd been doing it for a while. I was like, yeah you get your little like your tube socks and your bottle of wine or whatever. You have your little things. Is that you kind of need to make the road feel like home and and they're not because it's not it's not your family and it's not your bed. Most people go home to their family or their bed or their whatever and they have their food in their fridge. That's their usual go to stuff because they go to the same Supermarket or they know the local guy and none of that stuff exists on two or so people get really finicky about you know, that's that's why and that's why I appreciate when you when you're advancing a show and the guy who's organizing the show actually calls and says hey, Can you send your Rider of the specific stuff you want and add anything else? Because you know, you're in Texas or urine, you know, so if you're in Texas, you say yeah, we want to we want to to two racks of ribs because we know that the ribs are good in Texas or whatever and you can't get good ribs in you know, Milwaukee or whatever, you know, so it's really actually kind of cool when people actually go hey, we we understand you're in a band and it's you know that there are challenges out there. So they help to accommodate that because they're not going to they're not going to Do anything they can't do anything else not going to fly your family and they're not going to necessarily buy you five amazing hotel room. So you got an awesome bed to sleep. And so they just go. Yeah when we go and get the beer and the wine and the whatever will make sure we make a stop and pick up the specific thing that you want and it makes a big difference. So tube socks very important and you should not have drank that bottle of wine. They would have flipped out.	
2	Well, that's what I kept trying to tell my friend. I'm like dude like the one item there. That's for somebody specifically. I had kind of a similar story to when he came Stone Sour ended up backstage at a Stones our concert and but this one I didn't have to say anything because their Road manager that dude took control of that room. He let everybody know what the hell was up and we're sitting there hanging out and I can't remember again who the opening band was but I was sitting there talking with them and as the road manager goes through he's like if you guys want he goes this is the food for everybody else. You guys can help yourself to this. This is so and so and he's like in this bottle of Jack do not touch it. It's for Cory and everybody's like, all right, cool like so that's you know, No, everybody knows that that that that's his so nobody touches it. Yeah fast forward to the end of the night. I'm shooting the shit with Corey Taylor and out of nowhere and I'm already pretty well wasted at this point. He was like, hey man, you want a drink and I'm like sure yeah and Heap he gets like a full Pint glass and he just puts a couple ice cubes in it and then just goes with the Jack and then he goes over and he grabs the Coke and he goes Splash and then he hands me the drink and I was like, oh my God, I'm gonna die tonight. I'm literally Gonna Die. Thanks to Corey Taylor and I love this is gonna be amazing. That's I'm gonna love this story.	
1	Yeah. Now that's the stuff. That's worth the story. I was I remember seeing the documentary on why the fuck am I blinking on his name? I'm so tired. Um motor motor head. I'll let me see this thing of let me fucking let me fucking let me the documentary on Lemme and I think it was I can't remember what band it was but it was a hardcore band. I think it was like the guys from Anthrax and they were like, they went back stack. They go backstage and he and Lemmy's apparently aren't he was he was gentleman and a scholar and all the good stuff and he was like a Godfather of punk rock to all these bands and they're like, holy shit. We're hanging out in the back with Lambie and he invites Anthrax in the dressing room. I think it was that ban and and he's like, hey, man, you guys want a jack you want a drink you want to Jack and they were like, yeah sure. We'll have a drink with Lemmy and so they think they're gonna get a glass of Jack and he just he pulls out four bottles of Jack and opens it and hand it to each one of them and now they're just holding. Entire bottle jack and he takes a hit and and they're like, oh this is what it's like to drink with Lemmy and he's just sitting there talking for a couple hours drinking it and they had to just kind of try to keep up and that's kind of what it's that's the thing that I find funny with bands that are you know, really hardcore bands. Once you're out there and you build up that tolerance. That's how they drink man. I can't I don't I can't do that stuff anymore. I didn't really I didn't really do it. I didn't really do it that much before like I had my I had my nights but like like a a whole bottle goddamn. Well, you know, but those guys but yeah, that's but those are the stories those the funny things like I was trying to tell it's funny. We were doing this we were doing it. We just finished the show in Utah for the edge up in Utah in is it is you see, this is the one thing we have this weird fucking thing where we're technically in Nevada, right? Okay, but we're right. We're right on the border like we're literally half a mile from Might hurt so we're right on the border. And the phone's everybody's phone had a different time on it like my phone and Jamie's phone were the same and power and Brian's phone were an hour earlier and we actually got to the gig half an hour late because we didn't we thought we were gaining an hour by coming in and they were like no. No everyone makes that mistake. Don't worry about it. But like we point being is I'm here with the band and we hold on.	
3	Hold on one second. I don't know what the fuck's going on with me. my home	
1	The fuck is this the fucking clock God? Damn it the clock in my fucking hotel keeps switching someone some person before me switch the alarm on and now it's been it's been turning on every five minutes during the podcast. I don't know if you could hear it like it's driving me nuts. I just had to rip it out of the fucking wall. So anyway, I'm here. I'm here with the guys and how is the designated single guy? Bye and I'm doing everything I can to get this kid laid like but like he's just he's very particular and so in terms of like like there was there was a girl that we saw the show and he's you know, he's 28 now, whatever it is and it's free. He's supposed to be having the time of his life and I try to tell him like dude just you know, you got a hotel room if you meet a girl buy her a drink see if you can you know, do do you thing none of my business but like do something do something? Got a hotel room. You just did a great show and he never closes he can't close and there was this or he doesn't want to close I shouldn't say he can't because he totally could but he chooses not to and we got into it and and there was this girl that seemed interested and then eventually something came up where he was like Yeah, and I don't think I'm going to she's with her friends and it's complicated and I don't know what to do about you know, what's what I don't want to do with the baggage and XYZ and and then also he said like she looks a little crazy and I kind of like crazy, but I'm not sure if I like that kind of crazy. And I said dude this entire. The only thing that really keeps you going in this game is the stories. You know, when Corey Taylor pause you a glass of Jack with a splash of coke. These are the stories. It doesn't matter. If you have the you're not supposed to have the time of your life, but you need you need to build up some stories and ironically all my band stories are at the moment is us all in the hotel room after the show watching Big Mouth. Haha having a great but that's because the three kids are three of us. We're not going out like Then Jamie and may wear off the market. So we're just hanging out with each other watching big mouth and but Power has the best. I think he has a better time with us then going Chasin Tail, and I probably would too because I got the best bang of the world where really we really have a great time just hanging out with each other. But like I keep trying to tell him like just go up and get in some fucking trouble will bail you out if you get arrested, but do something and I'm still trying I'm trying so hard to corrupt him. And I know he's listening right now because he listened to the podcast. I'm trying to corrupt him and he's so he's just too good. He's too nice. He's too sweet for his own good but he's like a badass guitar player who just he's funny as shit. And then when it comes to this other stuff, I'm like going just break a window or do something rock and roll and he's like that.	
2	Let's watch Big Mouth fucking well the most rock and roll thing you got going right now.	
1	It's pulling alarm clocks out of the walls because the alarm won't stop going off. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I miss I had like, I don't know. I must have had five beers or whatever. Maybe a few more but like the edge through a VIP party afterwards which was heaps of find on the guys from the station. We're great. But I totally misread the altitude I basically went up and you know spend a couple hours at this party afterwards with the band and then I got up to the room and I'm like why the fuck do I feel like shit and I and then some was like, yeah, you know, we're like a mile and a half above the ground. I totally forgot and now I'm just so yeah, I'm ripping clocks out of the wall. But anyway, so the switching back to the story The Roadster. Sorry, I never really had. I don't really think I have any finicky stuff the funniest shit the funniest should happen at this gig yesterday where Bob from FMI management. He calls me up a few days early and he's like, okay, I'm sending you Rider all the normal stuff. Is there anything you want to add on? Cuz it's a casino in the middle of nowhere. You'll probably get you know a buffet but there's not going to really be any food. So do you want anything specific my thing for anyone who follows my stuff is oatmeal, so I'll have it. There's nothing else to eat if there's only if there's no sandwich platter if there's no way to get food if there's a I know that I can have a couple of bowls of oatmeal and I'm ready for the show. Like if I don't eat I'm not going to do a great show. If I eat that then I'm going to do a good show. So that's like my insurance policy. So I'm like, he's like, yeah, so you just want some oatmeal and I'm like, yeah and then at the end of the conversation I was like actually you probably should specify that I need oatmeal and something to make it with like I need like, you know some styrofoam cups and like a kettle to boil water. Because I because the worst thing that can happen is you're in a hotel that doesn't have a kettle or anything and you and then your you don't know how to actually fucking make it so he's like, yeah, ok, cool Kettle for hot water. So I get to the to the show and they go to that they say, oh, he's your little corner. It's at and it's all outdoor. So there's tent that set up, you know a few feet away from the stage and all the bands shit set up and then they've got like Jack and you know bottles are crown and XYZ and I'm there and I've got like Gatorade and you know a six-pack of beer and Each oatmeal and that's it. And that's what my right it. Looks like. Looks like the lame is Rider out of all these hardcore bands and ironically they put a kettle like this fucked up all like you it looked like they just pulled it out of trash like this old a scandal that was falling apart and there was no way to plug it in they had the cattle but they had no power anywhere and you can't go to the stage and plug in a kettle to make porridge next to the headline is retiring. So I was like this is finding a shit because technically they gave me The thing that I wanted but then I was like, well, I can't I gotta I gotta kind of MacGyver my way through this making of This porridge as I had to bring it all back up to the hotel which was like a 10-minute walk all the way across the other side of the light and then to make this porridge and just sitting there by myself. Just waiting for the kettle to boil me this shit to get it done. But I was fucking hilarious it like yes, they technically gave me everything I asked for but the one thing that and it's true because if you had forgotten to say if I'd forgotten to ask for the cattle. They never would have given me the kettle they would have said oh, yeah, here's You asked for and then I would have been jacked. Hmm point being my little story. That's not there's no point in that story. I don't know what the fuck I went on a tangent. Anyway, so my weird little story which is a true fact people ask me if this actually happened it actually did happen. It was fucking embarrassing but it was it was on the second album cycle when we were touring really heavily and everything was kind of automated like the way you know, like you didn't really have to think about much you just had to it was rinse and repeat, you know where the next show is, you know, when you're getting back on the bus, you know, what time? You got to wake up sound check, you know, you got a couple hours you go and get the food you do you go to the radio station blah blah blah. Everything's kind of on autopilot. So when things are thrown in the mix that are not planned, sometimes you just don't know what to do or you just miss them. So the routine was the when we're on the way to the show the bus driver would usually make a stop for gas and you can feel when you're in the bunk you can feel when the bus stops, right? So I've got to the rule on the bus is you there's a bus. There's a bathroom on the bus. The rule is you can go number ones. You don't go number two is because it just stinks out the whole bus and and it takes a long time to get the smell away. So if you go to do a number two, you wait for a stop or you ask the bus driver to stop and you go in the petrol station. So in my bunk, I feel the bus stop and the rule is you got to go you get up and you put a pillow on on the driver seat. You put this little pillow from the front Lounge on the driver's seat, and then he gets back on the bus and he knows oh someone's gotten off the bus. I'm I got to wait for them to get back. They've gone to the bathroom. Hmm. I was so half asleep. I forgot the pillow. So I go to the service station and I go to the bathroom and I walk out in the bus is gone. This is gone. Oh and I don't have my phone. I don't have anything. I've got nothing and I don't know where I am. And I don't know where I'm going because the bus just takes you there and then you get there and you are you wake up and you go, where are we today and the go, Portland, Maine? Okay, cool. Because when you're on tour for that long, you just kind of forget about it. So now I'm at the service station with nothing dude with nothing. Like I'm basically in my pajamas wasn't wearing shoes because I just was half asleep. Hmm and I look like a fucking homeless person dude, and I go so I go into the go into the service station and I asked this lady who was very nice. She was very accommodating and I'm like, hey, I need a phone please real quick because I've got a call someone. Go and get them to turn around and she's like oh of course and she gives me the phone the service station landline and I realized I don't know anyone's phone number because they're all saved in my phone. And I don't remember anyone's number. Like I haven't physically called anyone forever and I definitely don't know the bus drivers number.	
2	Yeah, all the numbers are in your phone. They're all saved.	
1	So I'm like I started I'm spinning my wheels and I'm like what the fuck am I gonna do? Like, I might actually be in trouble. I don't know. They're gonna get there. He's not gonna know he's going to I've all the way to wherever the next show is. So I have to say to this woman and I look like I'm homeless I look like I'm about to ask her for spare change and I'm like, hey, I'm actually in a rock and roll band and I'm on tour and I was in that bus that pulled up and she was like, oh, yeah. I saw that bus they left a few minutes ago. And as I'm thinking I'm thinking the further the bus gets away the more fucked I am so the clock is ticking and I was like I need to catch up with I need to contact that bus, but I don't know how Ow, and I need to figure it out and she was like, well, where is it going? And I said, I don't know. I don't wish direction did it drive and she was like I don't I didn't see what direction it left like it just it was there and then I did something and I was gone. I was like, oh my God, I'm so fucked so she actually got on my this is so messy. She looks up the band of my website to find out where my next fucking show is and she says, oh, I don't remember where the show is. Oh it's in it's in Vegas. You're going that direction and I'm like, okay, but what do I do with that information? I can't call him. I can't do anything. So she gets the janitor and she's like, hey John you got your car and it was like yeah, she said all right. This guy's in trouble and I'm like dude. If you can give me a ride. I'll just I'll just spot you 50 bucks right now. As soon as I get to the the bus, I'll give you a 50 bucks. And you know, can you can you hook me up? I'm kind of in a bind and he was like, yeah man sure if it's yeah, whatever you just need a minute. And so so I get in this random guys car it was this dinked up little Honda Civic that just barely started dude. It was like busted up. In the middle of fucking nowhere and he starts hauling ass down the freeway and we're going we must have been driving for 40 minutes because we had to make up for the time we lost and then the bus is still moving. So he's going like a hundred and the bus usually the freeways are like 80 the bus driver usually does 90 because who gives a shit and so now we're hauling ass at a hundred hundred and ten trying to catch up with this bus. Finally.	
3	You should have seen the look on the bus drivers face when I'm like Keanu Reeves from speed like leaning out the car door I can Even out the window.	
1	I'm like stop the bus pull over there's a bomb on your bus and I'm screaming at the driver and he looks at me like what the fuck are you doing in the car? Thought you in the back. He's freaking out. He pulls the thing over we pull over next to me and he's like, he's more scared than anything. He's like he thinks he's in trouble. He thinks I'm going to yell at him like you motherfucker you left without me and I just had to be like, hey man, my fault. I forgot the pillow. And I'm lucky I found you and he was he all he said was to don't tell don't tell the band. Please don't tell you manager in the band or anyone. I'm get fired. Like I was like dude, it's cool. It's between us because we both kind of like he didn't really fuck up. He didn't know but I was like it's a bit I was like, it's all right. It's all right. We didn't tell anyone for like years. We had like three different bus drivers before I ever told anyone that story because I forgot about it by the time we had a new bus driver and then someone asked me what the weirdest thing that happened on tour was and I remembered that and I was still half By the time I got back on the bus got on the bus found my wallet gave the guy 50. He was like cool man. See you later. Boom. He was gone and it was like and then we got on the bus as if nothing had happened and we woke up and like I kind of gave the bus driver a little James bond-like like where we like we know the Straight Dope but no one else really knows what's going on. There was one time we sort of looked at each other like you good. Yeah. I'm good. You're good. Okay cool. And then we and then we never spoke of it again. And that was like and I couldn't believe it happened. It was like the thing out of him. Almost Famous where the guys running after the bus I couldn't believe that it actually happened. It was like spinal tap. There's all these spinal tap moments that you find in your life when you're touring and you go I can't believe this like when you're backstage and you're walking around with your instruments and you can't find the stage door that shit really happens like you do so many shows every once in a while one of those things happen and you go and the catchphrase is always on my God. This is so spinal tap. That was one of the most spinal tap moments and it came out Almost Famous where they Over that and it's the lead singer. How do you leave that lead singer? What are you gonna do when you get to the show and you missing the lead singer they would have been screwed and I would have had to wear it too. They wouldn't and all because of a fucking pillow I'll because you forgot the pillow just one pillow Wonder one of those little things you think of those things like you make one tiny mistake when you're in the routine of it and and it really it can throw a spanner in the works hardcore man.
