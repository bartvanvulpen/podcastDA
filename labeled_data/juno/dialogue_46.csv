I love to chat about all things self-care self-love living our very best lives and finding our inner magic Soul. Sugar is a community of blooming Soul Seekers like sugar for your soul. Hello. Hello. Everyone happy to be back. Back here on an all-new episode. I just got back from Poland about four days ago, which was really cool. I went into my trip to Poland without any expectations. I really didn't know much about what it's like to be a tourist in that country and I was very pleasantly surprised Alex and I had so much fun. If any of you guys follow my Instagram, it's at Carrie rad. I was posting all over the place and I got a lot of dams from you guys saying like, oh my goodness. I never thought about trying Going to Poland but it looks really cool. And it was so cool. We were in the Lake District of Poland. So we were on the water almost every single day and it was just a beautiful trip, but the jet lag is so very real Europe is always a difficult one Europe and Asia are always hard and so I'm feeling the jet lag, but I'm also feeling I'm feeling good. It's getting better. That's for sure. I am really excited about today's episode because we are talking about Sexual empowerment and I have an coming on who is so incredible in every single way. She is as cool in person as she will sound to you here on the podcast. She is such a warm and bright person and she's so fun to talk to and I've just always felt super connected to her ever since I've met her so I'm really excited to share an with all of you guys because I think you guys will love her just as much as as I do I want to talk to you guys one-on-one before we get into the conversation with an really quick because I think it's good for me to just kind of pop in here and let you guys know how I'm currently feeling about what we'll be talking about and kind of like what I've been unpacking recently and I do plan to do this on most episodes first and foremost when it comes to sexuality I want to put this out into the air that we should not Not have judgments on this topic. I think that people women especially but men do it to make people feel shame sometimes when they are expressing their sexuality or and bracing it or just talking about it. And if there is any piece of advice, I could give to you guys it would just be to stop judging people in general. I think there is just so much to be judged on at all times. And what I really try to do in my life is make people feel comfortable when they're talking about something and especially in person, you know people really pick up on mannerisms and people can tell when you're judging them and it's such a hurtful thing. So I guess on all of my episodes when I bring guests on or Or just in general in your life. Like let's remove judgment and let's just listen and embrace and when it comes to sexuality and being comfortable with it that is part of the human process and what a beautiful thing to be able to feel comfortable with I touch about this on the episode. I talked about the fact that we are all here on this planet because of sex and so Why not make sex as enjoyable as it can be because it's something that we are able to experience. So why not enjoy it and obviously there are so many different people on so many different paths when it comes to sexuality and people are trying to overcome traumas and you know, there's just so many different things that people go through through the process of coming to terms with their sexuality and feeling confident with their sexuality. And so no matter where you are in your life. I hope this episode will help bring you some information and some knowledge from sexual empowerment expert who's going to go into different ways that you can learn to be a little bit more comfortable with your body and with your sexuality as important as it is for us to nurture our self love and confidence and practice self-care the process of being comfortable with our sexuality. Goes hand-in-hand with that whole process of becoming our best selves. So now let's get into our episode with an I am so unbelievably excited for today's guests. I have my friend and new in who is such an incredible human being in general but is also doing such amazing things in the sexual empowerment realm. I first met and through YouTube and I just instantly connected with her and just fell in love with who she is as a person. She worked for YouTube and we got to know each other through that and through different events. And I noticed all of this sexual empowerment content that she was creating on her Instagram and it was inspiring me so much and I have been sort of just watching her journey and I watched her go from you know working with YouTube. And then now she's taking the dive and pursuing this sexual empowerment coaching full time. So I'm so happy to have you here and I am so excited to ask you so many questions about what you're doing in the world right now because it's so cool. Thank you. It is such a pleasure to be here and yeah such a cool full circle Journey that we've been on together. So in and Instagram bio, she says I helped Soulful and vicious as fuck women fall in love with their pleasure and sexuality and I just absolutely love that that is so powerful and it just like tells you everything you need to know right there in a nutshell exactly this totally under Not my mission and I love that you're fired up about it because I am too. So the first question that I have for you is I want to know your why I want to know where the passion comes from and why you feel like you were placed on this planet to talk about sexual empowerment. You know, it's a really deep question and I think it really comes back to my life experience and especially because you say, why was I put on the planet to do this? This right. So I was born into this world and for anyone listening that might have liked sensitivities or trigger warnings. I just want to warn that I might be like talking about abuse and abusive relationships and things like that. So I grew up in a house where I experienced violence from a young age and that really impacted me as I grew into a teenager into a woman, of course, it was exploring love. Sexuality in our Modern World Without Really knowing the impact of it. I started to engage in really emotionally abusive relationships relationships where I didn't really listen to my body pretty much. I felt like I had everything else together in my life except for sex and love and I was truly afraid that I would be broken forever. And then I started going on my own journey of healing through trauma healing through sexuality and what I found Lee what I was seeking was a way to enjoy myself more in bed or to have better orgasms or to connect with partners and create healthy relationship and I learned all of those things through exploring my own sexuality and my own Journey, but what I really really really discovered was that sexuality was not just about orgasms and it wasn't just about sex what I found is that for women, especially sexuality and reclaiming this part of yourself is The most deeply empowering things that you can do. It is the source of creativity. It is a connection to your own body and your own self love and your own confidence and Radiance and your soul and I haven't seen any other work like it that is so transformative on multiple levels that I couldn't help but continue forward and you know, leave my job and start a whole business around it because I feel so passionately that this is Exactly what we as women need to continue on to this journey of you know for lack of better words crushing the patriarchy and really reclaiming our wholeness and our power and our world and our society. It extends so far beyond just the bedroom and I think empowering women in that way is a big big big part of my wife or this work. I love that so much and I think that what I love so much about it is also just like breaking the fact that it can be so uncomfortable to chat about sexuality in general and I've been on my own path with that when it comes to just being comfortable with talking about it because for a long time I am a sexual being and I would be so afraid to mention anything on my Channel or my platform or even to like friends and stuff like that and I me as I grew as a woman started feeling a little bit more comfortable and now I don't second-guess myself and think like okay who's listening to this or I don't feel shame around it anymore and it takes time and I think what you're doing and the work that you're doing is really taking the shame away from sex because why should their necessarily be Shame about feeling sexually empowered and learning to heal from any any trauma that you have experienced and you know sex has such a you know, a wonderful part of being a human right? It's like the most naturally luxurious thing that we get to experience just naturally and so I love that you're doing it and I just think that it's such important work, duh. Thank you. And yeah, thank you for sharing that I think shame is one of the number one things about sexuality and it kind of goes hand-in-hand with what I was talking. Not in terms of women's empowerment. Right? It's no mistake that our sexuality has been taught to us as shame as a way to keep a small and I love that you're stepping up and inviting me and talking about these things because yeah, that's how we break that mold. So I want to know what a day in the life of a new and looks like when it comes to being a sexual empowerment coach, like could you walk me briefly through a day in your life, and I know that That you're currently in the transition of going from a full-time gig to pursuing your passion full time, which I think is incredible and I want to know more about that later on just that switch and how that's been for you for now. I want to know exactly like what a day in the life of a sexual empowerment coach. Looks like the first thing is that I wake up in the morning and I really focus on my own embodiment. So any great practitioner any good yoga teacher Need good therapist any good coach. It's really about the level in which they hold their work in their own body that really creates potent transformation. So I am continuously working on my own sexual empowerment and my own Journey. So I usually wake up in the morning and do some sort of self-pleasure practice or meditation or maybe something more gentle some days. I'll do things like breathwork. It really depends the great thing about Being sexually empowered is you get really in tune with your own body and what you need so I'll kind of wake up and diagnose. What is it that my body and my soul needs and I focus on myself first because that's what I teach my clients to do. You can't give from an empty. Well, right not only that but filling myself up with sexual energy is super creative. It's super potent. It's super luscious. It's just a great way to approach and live your life. After that. I'll likely have sessions with clients. So I have one-on-one sessions with them where we do body based work where I guide them through practices and a lot of transformative fun happens in those sessions. I might then go and record a guided audio practice for them to do at home. I give all my clients practices to do in between our sessions. I tell my clients all the time. You can listen to all the words I say, but I don't care about that. I want you to feel for yourself the power. Power of this inside of your own life and your own body and then I might send them their notes and things like that. And then usually I will be writing content showing up on Instagram stories sharing what I think is going to be the most useful for my audience and then currently I'm working on a group coaching program that I'm launching soon. So working on putting that together maybe filming videos for that filming guided audio practices for that as well and Are also taking time at the end of the day to once again, take care of myself and to replenish that is so cool. I was I'm curious about what kind of clients do you normally work with? And is there a norm or does it really range? Do you normally work with couples or do you predominantly work with women or people dealing with trauma or is it just like all across the board? I usually work primarily with women who are focused on wanting to empower themselves. Elves within their sexuality and the reason why I work with women is because are so low is because a lot of times our sexuality gets really tied to the other especially as women were programmed to associate sex to only be something we experience in bed with someone else or only something that we use to give someone else pleasure. And it's very separate from our own sort of sexual sovereignty Independence using it for ourselves. And so that's the In which I like to work with women and if things with their relationship and things like that come up, what I'm doing is I'm working on their personal empowerment. So then they can show up in their relationships from a place of wholeness. So that's my primary focus right now. I want to know how doing this affects your personal life because if it were me I feel like if I was a sexual empowerment coach, I feel like Alex would just be like getting Tired with how many like research sessions I try to do with him like I'm curious about like how does this work affect your personal life? Like are you because I feel like a lot of people might think like, oh, wow. She's a sexual empowerment coach. So she's probably like so involved in the bedroom like or is it something like is there like a balance that you have learned to have obviously you are so in tune with your sexuality and You can just tell by the way that you speak through everything and I just find it really cool and want to know like how it affects you in your life the beautiful thing about sexuality and sensuality when you really own it. It's a part of you it's your confidence. Like I said, it's your Radiance. So it honestly impacts every single aspect of my life. I find that my relationships are richer because I'm showing up from a place of love and wholeness. I feel like people can open up to me. Or even you know, my personal friends and everything because they feel safer with me because there's no judgement. I feel more empowered in my work because I'm creating from this place of creativity and from really fueling myself from the inside. And of course, it does impact my relationship with my partner as well though. I think you know boundaries are really good. So I definitely turned coach mode on for my clients and while I'm working and then When I'm with him, I go into partner mode. And of course there will be certain times where maybe will you know set up a sex date where we're doing certain practices or focusing on certain things and there's a lot more communication and our sex life such as you know, very seamless and it's just a part of how we operate and you know, my partner had no idea about any of these things before we started dating. I've introduced the parts that I feel like are good for day-to-day and I've seen him him even take them on and really enjoy them and then you know, I do give space for us to just like flow and just to be and not to push all of the time and then yeah setting specific containers for exploration versus just kind of like normal. We're just enjoying each other kind of sex if that makes sense. Yeah. I mean, it's just part of who I am too. And you know, I'm lucky enough or I've created their kind of relationship where I have someone Fully accepts me for who I am. So talking about these things is just part of me and I've made sure to call in someone in my life who welcomes that with open arms. That's so great. And it's such an important part of a relationship. It brings so much connection, and it's also not bad thing to practice or research for you know, something that you do in your life, like what a wonderful thing to be able to learn more about and into practice and experience with your own partner, and I also think it's so cool, but you mentioned about friendships because the best thing on the planet is having a friend that you feel so comfortable with talking to especially about sexuality and you know the ins and outs of what might be going on with your partner sexually or what you are experiencing and thinking in bed and like having I can totally see how It benefits your relationships because I can see that why they would have that trust with you because obviously because this is what you do you understand completely and you also don't have judgment. So that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, totally we will get back into the episode in just a moment. But first I want to tell you guys about today's sponsor away thoughtful luggage for modern travel.

Calm Soul sugar now. Let's get back to the episode. You are pursuing your passion full-time, which is one of my favorite things on the planet to talk about and to help Inspire because I think taking a side gig and a passion project and making it something that you make the leap and you have the courage and the strength to just kind of take hold of it full-time. I think that that is such an incredible thing to experience. So I want to know do you have any tips? Tips for someone who wants to take a leap like this in any any type of passion whether it be writing or blogging or you know, any type of coaching any type of side business like but let's say they don't know where to begin. I would say one follow your curiosity and follow the places where you need to stretch yourself to grow right? So I learned a lot of the work that I did because Because I saw the parts of myself where I struggled the most and I really took a deep dive into learning everything that I could and putting everything that I could into practice. It was also something that I was naturally curious about and then the other thing I would say is like just to start creating and diving into it first for yourself rather than you know wanting necessarily to make it into a full-fledged business or things like that. You're only going to Successful and something that you just like truly truly love doing and that you have like a bigger Mission behind right versus just kind of like creating for other people before you're creating for yourself. So I think that would be the first thing that I would say and then the second thing I would say is like really be patient and allow it to take its own time and its own Journey. So I'll just give full context five years ago. I did my first life coaching training. It was the first time that that I had heard of coaching. I kind of Dove off the deep end and join this training and I tried to start a business and it failed because I hadn't really grown in myself personally and that's really the thing that tipped off this whole journey that now five years later, you know, I did the second training and now I'm you know, launching my business, but I think a lot of people don't see those long-term stories behind someone going full-time right there, like wow magical moment, but You know an actuality this has been five years in the making I feel like every project every career every business kind of has like a spirit and a soul of its own and allowing it to take the time that it needs to emerge naturally and be ready in a world where we kind of like push and try and do so hard there. Is that kind of leaning more into the feminine flow of how these things are created and Just taking little baby steps each one at a time. I'm still in that process right? I'm taking baby steps every single day. And I think that is much more sustainable than trying to push or force all at the same time. I love that. You said that each business or creation or passion project has a soul of its own because that is just so true and you do have to kind of allow the universe to guide you with. And kind of you listen to the signs snow. Okay, like this is the next step. Okay? Okay, maybe maybe this isn't the week. I'm going to take now but once I hit this point, then I'll make that even bigger leap or whatever. It might be and I think just really paying attention and I love the soul aspect of it because it's so true. Like if you are connected to the soul of your passion, then you're going to be able to hear it when it tells you and guides you along the way on its own Journey. Yeah. I love it. One thing that I absolutely love on your Instagram when I watch which by the way you guys I'm going to say all the details of how you can find and in all the places, but her Instagram is the and new wind so we use spell it for everyone and it's at and then the a NN and then new in right and uh, huh. Yeah, g uy e n. Yeah and g. Uy e m is yay. Hmm. Okay, cool. So that's where you can find her on Instagram. And one of my favorite things that you do over there is when you do your kind of like self-love sexual empowerment dances. I love it so much inspires me so much when I see you doing that and I'm just like yes, and it's so good. I am my old apartment in Silver Lake. I didn't have air conditioning and in Silver Lake Los Angeles. It gets really really hot in the summer and And the way that I would cope is that I would call it my sexy Spanish summer and I would like put on like salsa music or some type of Spanish style music and I would just like dance by myself in there and like just make it like such a fun experience for me and it wasn't necessarily like in my mind. I wasn't thinking okay. This is sexual empowerment for me, but it was just this freeing feeling it was helping me cope. With a situation where I was just like I would just like imagine I was in Cuba and I was like this beautiful Latin Spanish girl just like dancing to like the Spanish record in her apartment and it would just like help me cope with the heat so much. And so whatever I see you doing those videos. I always think about that and I still love dancing by myself. I have air conditioning now, so it's not as like sexy as it was when I was like glistening everywhere in my apartment go. It was so damn hot, but I just love that you do that and I think that it's such a great practice for people to do and it can be so hard to do in your life to just like feel comfortable with doing but I'm sure that like when people start it they just like can't get enough of it. Is that something that you recommend for people when they like are exploring their bodies and their sexuality? Yes. Absolutely and I love that just Interview and I actually remember when you're posting that and me like furiously trying to find what Spanish music you're playing really great people inspire you and you don't even know so yes, I totally remember that and I'm loving the image and yeah dancing is such a way to get out of your head into your body and into enjoyment and I love the fact that you said like it didn't feel explicitly sexual. And I think that's why I love the practice so much is because we tie sexuality to kind of quote-unquote explicitly sexual right meaning the stereotypical like vixen or whatever that essentially we get in Hollywood. But your sexuality has so many flavors. It's playful. It's fun. It's free, right and when you're in that state that's when your natural sexuality that's when your natural desire and your natural aliveness arises out of you. That's why I always say that you know sexuality is not just about the bedroom. It's not just about like rawr sex, right? It's about all these different flavors of you that are allowed to be and I think that's when we get the most healthy the most vibrant sexuality that we can and yeah moving to music connecting to your body such a beautiful beautiful and easy way to do that. I also want to know I mean obviously dancing is a great way to begin and just getting in touch with your body, but I want to know your number. One piece of advice for somebody who wants to get in touch and explore their sexuality further without giving away your secret sauce because they're going to have to pay you for that. But if you could if they could just get maybe like a little gist of like what your you know what you recommend and like what you would say to somebody on the street that comes up to you and asks you like what's your number one piece of advice or friend or whatever it might be. I'll first say sort of like The mantelpiece and the mindset piece of it that I would invite people to explore and then I'll share a couple of practices that are really beautiful for this. So I think the first thing that I would tell someone tell a woman especially is claim your sexuality as yours start to disentangle it from the approval of others or what other people think of you or even how you can give to others from it and start to invite in a relationship with your sexuality. Leti that is just about you that is about you honoring yourself. That's about you connecting with yourself. That's about you empowering yourself from the inside so that you can show up into relationships sexual situations everywhere you are from that power. So really redefining what it means to be a sexual woman in the world what sexuality is to you I think is number one and then for the tools, I think this is my favorite part about the work. There's so many Goal and tangible tools that you can use right sexuality does not have to be a mystery. It is not something that is just for the lucky ones. It is something that you can practice the same way you practice yoga the same way you practice meditation the same way you practice like that perfect facial routine and all of that. It's the same thing. The first thing I would recommend is yeah doing things like getting into your body getting into your pleasure a tuning to the things that make you feel good - Day-to-day one thing that I have is what I call my 5% rule which is in every aspect of your life. How can you make it five percent more pleasurable. So that doesn't have to be sexual right? It's just about feeling good at the root of sexuality. It's about feeling good inside of yourself. So if you are washing the dishes can you put on a song that feels really good? Even if you're just taking a shower, can you turn on a candle? Or if you're having a meal, can you just put like flowers next to you write all of these things are to attune you two feeling good to feeling the pleasure in your everyday life, which is really going to translate into the bedroom. The second thing that I would recommend is conscious self pleasure. And so that means not just self-pleasuring in the moment because you're bored or you try to get a quick fix or you know, or what not but turning it into an actual practice. Is so the first practice that I ever did was before even going to the explicitly sexual you can practice touching your body really slowly and with presents and with an intention to give yourself love and that is going to deeply rewire the whole way that you've connected to your body. Especially if you've had previous experiences where maybe you haven't respected your body or others haven't respected your Right that's going to re-establish this really deep connection going slow and being present also helps you tune in to the actual sensations of your body. Which help you to know. What do I really like? How do I actually like to be touched and helps you a tune to like? Oh, wow even just a touch of you know, my fingers on my skin can feel really Exquisite if I just pay attention so so many of us are are having sex eating living our lives without actually being present and even just slowing down and doing something like this can really help probably stage 2 or 3 from that would be then starting to use tools like your breath to really deepen and move your Sexual Energy so that it's full-bodied and learning kind of someone more of those self-pleasure techniques that can take it from something that you just do casually to something that's Really nourishing something that is that you can use to work on yourself and you can think of self pleasure as like practice. So just the same way that you go to basketball practice and you practice shooting your practice dribbling and all of that then when you're in the game, it's much more seamless, right? Then you're just playing and you're going and you're there and that's the same with having a self pleasure practice you practice a lot of the tuning in to yourself. if Feeling Good Feeling pleasure so that when you get in the game with someone else and your you don't have a partner in sex, all of those things are really inside of your body and come naturally such great information and it just feels like II know this sounds bizarre, but when you speak through it, it sounds like just such a like comfy spot and like almost like this like warm hug because it's like yes, it's about sexuality, but it's also just like nurturing that that's one of the words that you used and that's like such a Great way to explain it because it is about you. It is about yourself love. It's about exploring and understanding yourself and like the way that you explain. It just sounds like such a warm hug and like comfortable cozy place to be in totally. Yeah. It was like giving yourself the warmest hug the like biggest like bath of like goodness before your day starts our I mean you can do it whenever but yeah, it's like I really see pleasure and your Sexual Energy. It's like medicine for your body. It's actually Fuel and you know, when more advanced practices you can learn how to start to store your sexual energy use it for healing and even use it for really fun stuff like manifestation through practices like sex magic and things like that. Okay. Well, we're gonna have to have you back on the podcast to tell us all about that kind of stuff because I love that and want to know more For sure. So an please let my listeners know where they can find you to learn more about what you do and your practice so you can find me on Instagram at the and win so that's th E A and M and G, uy e n and my website is the same the a Nguyen.com and that's where you can find me now.
