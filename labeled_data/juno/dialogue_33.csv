3	All right, everybody. Welcome back to the best out of their day Fern here. I'm with I'm with arguably my favorite person to work with. Mr. Joe Joe no pain. No gain. He's a Flowmaster. They owns an affiliate up in Michigan CrossFit. 8:01 or Z8. 108.	
1	108 108 one. It's eight one eight one zero, but the telephone exchange up here is 8 1 is 8 1 0 but so with the All eight oneuldo and how they call them the Flint area.	
3	Yeah, so but no like I Jojo and I every time I see like a seminar listen Jose on there. Like I know I'm in for a good evenings discussion about affiliate ownership and coaching and all that stuff. So Joe is currently on a walk right now in Flint Michigan where the for the temperature is currently 15 degrees. So if you're feeling bad for yourself stop because Joe is sucking it up.	
1	You don't go Yeah, no excuses. You got to get you got to get your activity and right that's why they call it.	
3	That's why I call you no pain to game dude.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, we have had some good talks over the over. There are few years here about the rabbit hole of affiliate ownership. He's usually what the top goes down.	
3	And that's I think that's largely where this is gonna go is kind of maybe we'll do some dues. Maybe we'll cover some don'ts and but I what the reason I've always enjoyed. Talking to you is because I feel like you're kind of like me in the sense that you're always kind of toying with things and always playing around with new ideas. And you're very much not what I would describe as risk-averse like you like to try things even if they don't work out which I think is which is probably the mark of a true entrepreneur I would imagine I don't know if you would categorize yourself that way or not.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always I guess I guess it's That pursuit of virtuosity ride just ride just always trying to Tinker and fix things and move forward and you have to do them. You know, you don't what do we always say like, you don't have to start right? You just have to start so start making the action happen and then start adjusting from there to make it fit your mold or whatever it's going to be. But yeah, I've made quite a few changes over the years. You're right. How many years? Have you had your fill it? We we have been open nine and a half years.	
3	I knew it was coming up on ten.	
1	Yeah, and then we got we were fortunate enough to go out to the 10-year affiliate gathering in Whistler. And yeah, we talked a little bit out there that 10-year Affiliated. I know you were out there and Jason was and yeah, but we got so we got a special little we got we would they snuck us into the side door because we were only nine and a half years and but that's what I feel like they're resilient.	
3	25 I think it's all a lot of affiliate owners feel. What was your I guess like did you have a take away from the summit? Like what gives her something you want from the affiliate owner Summit? Like what was there? Is there something you walked away from and you're just like, okay. I dig that or it's something I didn't know before.	
1	You know, I think it's always great to get that chance to jump inside coach glassman's head and just see what in the world is going on in there because he you know over the years. He's made a lot of decisions for CrossFit headquarters that sometimes the community has or has not agreed with and when we look back over the years at a majority of those decisions, I think all of them like not nothing no decisions. He has made have been Decisions, they might have felt odd at the time but but looking back yet the affiliate community in the CrossFit Community always comes out smelling like a rose. So I think this just seeing you remember that little web he made on the at the affiliate Gathering about like where we are now, so we got there and it was it was like the ball of like, what are you describing?	
3	It was like this basically so Matt if you're Trying to visualize this so it's just imagining you had like this big ball of yarn that was not like put together in any it's just like this big Clump in here just like that looks like a mess. And what was it? What was his how do you describe that? It was just like listen, he was like, it doesn't really matter like what the path was for how we got here. Is that was that what it was? I don't know how you describe.	
1	Yeah that yeah, that's what it was. And yeah, that's basically made it was this big shift from you know, the competition side of things to the health and wellness shift and it was It was just kind of neat to see the timeline of events of items that happened events that happen in coach glassman's life to kind of lead us to this new lens of CrossFit that is still definitely focused on games and competitiveness, but but it but it definitely lessened the focus of it and made a bigger Focus towards health and wellness and it was kind of neat. I think just to hear coach glassman's reasoning as to how we got there and I think a lot of it You know only only some 10 years affiliate owners can understand that scope for that lens because a lot of times when you get into a filly ownership in the beginning I know in the when I did, you know, I was I was a big competitor and I was thinking competitive competitive competitive and it wasn't the only thing driving my business in the very very beginning. I definitely wanted to help out the normal population, but selfishly driven I was a competitor and and over Years, you start to realize like that's not how you keep your doors open. So it's kind of neat to see how coach Glassman shifted the whole lens of the organization how he got there through to these steps.	
3	So I think they're gonna release that talk soon. But So for anybody was wondering kind of what we're talking about. He kind of went through this chronological kind of slides of just like dates like this significant dates within the past. I think it was like within the past like three or four years as far as like meeting with people significant things shifts that the company has made the new website when they came off social media and all that stuff and he and like Joe subscribe and he kind of walked everybody through his through the cycle of why he did things and I know it's a lot of people don't disagree a lot of people disagree with certain things. He did. However good news on the social media front CrossFit training is back on Instagram. So if you are not following them, you need to go follow at CrossFit training on Instagram, right? Now stop this podcast go search it follow it. So I was really stoked because I think that came back on like Monday or Wednesday or Tuesday this week.	
1	So yeah, I saw that and that was really exciting very exciting ice and I also think I read somewhere that they gave as soon as they came back on the game like almost 10,000 new followers as soon as they came back onto Instagram and they had all their it was the same platform. They had before look like it was just paused.	
3	And taken offline so they didn't lose any followers, but you're getting 10,000 immediately it look like all right, which I have no doubt and I think I'm just super excited to see like I'm super excited to see them back on Tobacco on Instagram because I think that's just a really awesome outlet and I get for anybody who's wondering like he did have some philosophical differences with those companies, which I get and it's his company so he can do that. But yeah, the Philly governor was cool is cool to see that it was cool to see him talk through that and we were fortunate. See it twice. We got to see a truncated version at the trainer Summit. But what was your what was your takeaway from the trainer Summit?	
1	Oh gosh, you know I at that I am never disappoint every time I work at seminar for CrossFit headquarter is I always introduce our staff and I talked about not only the rest of screening process that they've had to go through to be able to come on board to staff but also the extensive amount of professional development that they have been through to assure that so that we cross you can just assure that this is the best of the best that we have to offer in L1. Out to orchids seminar and and that was no disappointment there at the summit. I remember we had these little small groups organized with PVC sticks and you know, it's it's interesting at the L2 experience. We give a lot of feedback to participants about	
3	I think I lost you. I lost them I'm going to have them dial back in will do a quick edit. So what he was talking about was some of the smiles from small breakouts, which I think we've talked about in some of the in some of the Previous episodes as far as like coach development. There was like a waterfall effect and Denise and I talked about it in her episode. And that was what he was alluding to. I'm trying to get him back on the call right now. I think he dropped it. It's probably just too damn cold in Michigan to to keep a phone call outside. But if he doesn't come back on I'll just splice these two together and we'll do both of them I might cut one out and do it that way, but let me see if we can get him back on.	
1	Yes, I'm back. All right, cool. Maybe maybe I walked through a dead zone. I don't know.	
3	I don't know. I thought I was afraid he got hit by a car on your long walk.	
1	All right, I wish you lot are we recording right now?	
3	Yeah recording. I just left it on and I was just doing okay A little Arnold and so but yeah, it's cool.	
1	Endowment that was a lot of fun. Another big takeaway is when we had that Zoe Hart to Hart Combs. He came in and talked and see how the so we're going to get her on the podcast into some stuff great.	
3	That's yeah, like I'm super stoked about that because like she is a she has like a lot of good stuff to say but like her talk was good. And then, dr. Jenkins has been on the podcast twice and he had some really awesome stuff to talk about to	
1	Yeah. Yeah. What was your what it's always good here.	
3	What was your favorite part about about Zoey's talk? Like what was your what was your big takeaway there?	
1	No, you know, I guess I guess one thing about Zoe that I thought was so interesting is I think my preference is sounds like she is a vegan by a preference you would see she enjoys that food. So I mean if she could have if she could pick any way she wanted to eat she would eat a vegan lifestyle and and I forgot how many years of your life or sounded like 80 or 90% of her life she has Been that way and and then but through all the studies that she's done and just research about nutrition and whatnot that she she makes herself eat meat because she knows that's what's best for her. And and that's that's an interesting angle that not a lot of that, you know, there's not a lot of vegan certain beaters because of the education that they've gone through.	
3	There's no message until the medication, but I think like the percentage of people that Go vegan or vegetarian and and convert back is something crazy high.	
1	I want to say it's like 80% like people tried and I didn't know how yeah, it's they're hot.	
3	What I thought was super hinging on her talk was like the I always kind of knew this but I didn't know to what degree that liver is the superfood for Humanity.	
1	I know it I that has been on my mind for I haven't seen it. I haven't made any liver yet, but I do have a member of my gym who are Jim's about five minutes. My house in the member of my gym is a butcher and his butcher shop is literally halfway between my house and the gym and he says he has liver in the shop and it's just a matter of time till I go in there and grab some and it because I've got it.	
3	I've got a grill myself up some liver and see what yeah seems like it's a superfood I'll have to I'm gonna have her will probably add some of the graphics that she showed there when we have on the show, but the thief I mean there is no food that even comes close. Close to liver when it comes to nutritional value. I mean it the the numbers on there were it was it was almost like somebody made it up. It was just like Hey, listen, if you could make a ridiculous Nietzsche nutritional protein product, it would be liver. It was just crazy.	
1	Yeah. Yeah and you hear you know, the big thing lately is like the carnivore diet a lot of people talk about the kind of our diet and and one of the misconceptions of the kind of or Diet is that you're just eating like rib eyes and t-bones and whatnot and all Delicious part of the cow, but you know the true kind of or Diet the reason people say that it works so well in the theory behind it is that you eat the animal nose-to-tail including all the organs which is kind of in line with what she was saying because the liver that contains all those minerals and vitamins that are critical to the technique of the metabolic system, you know, so that was definitely an alignment with that. Yeah. Yeah. I can't let little even I think so. Somebody also somebody asked her also, if she thought there was some type of a conspiracy theory like what what is taking Society so long to turn their lens and thinking that meat is bad and she she she with didn't miss a beat and just in reflected back upon like I don't know what is their first names were but like mr. Kellogg in mr. Graham. Oh, that's exactly 1800s. So they when they had like that they didn't want anybody to eat meat and I mean she really is and that was pretty deep rooted in to hear her not miss a beat and say look could be this. That was interesting. Well, I can remember exactly what it was but it had something to do with them making those companies and then also having a view to want to kind of change the world back in the day. I don't know how true or not it was but it was interesting was he why I'm going to explore gonna get this wrong.	
3	I'm gonna get this wrong, but they it was they were part of a Not a cult a cult is not what it is. But I want it was it was it a religion that was against Seventh-day Adventist that was right and they were against eating meat and that's how they started coming up with all this other stuff and when you think about it like oh that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. She she did not skip a beat on the conspiracy theory. She didn't say like definitively but she she outlined it and had a pretty strong argument for for why the like some of those companies are so prevalent in in the in the world of food production these days. But yeah, I can't wait to have her own cause like I listened to her podcast and is like she is just so well read and just like just and she doesn't mince words either. That's the other thing. I love about her. Like she just says it which is great.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. She's right to the point. Yeah, I think a lot of people exhausted are like that. We like to get right to the point. You know.	
3	Well, there's no yeah, there's no there's no sense of there's something there's no sense in like beating around the bush, which is kind of a good segue to the next piece, which I wanted to talk to you a little bit. What about your thoughts on Coach development you so Joe's been pulling been a Flowmaster Joe.	
1	Probably but I'm sad for 11 years. I think I've been a Flowmaster for seven or eight years.	
3	And then what was your seminar count three hundred and	
1	Yeah, I was like 360 some 360 some seminars, which I did a calculation was six and a half years of weekend's of my life have been dedicated to the L1 L2 and kids seminars six in an assistant because if you think about that that's almost a thousand hours on the floor just in a seminar setting. Yeah crazy and it's been it's been a great ride. I've loved it. I loved every second of it my wife explains it to me as others a the movie as a movie where these and there is this these two guys and they're watching one of those get ready to be a dad. And I think it's Seth Rogen and the other one is Paul Rudd. I think maybe they're sit on the bench and he says he's like, he's like look at these kids with their bubbles. I just wish I could Is happy about anything in life is those kids are about bubbles is what he says and I gotta be like I got to find bubbles in my life and my wife calls the seven hours bubbles. She's so every time I leave for a week and she says enjoy your bubbles hun is what she says and I walk out the door. But yeah, that's how I feel. I love I love working those seminars.	
3	That's a great credible way to describe that.	
1	Yeah, it's awesome to have it to have a job you love. You know, it's awesome to have a job you love and we had yeah, so and now I'm trying to extend it a little bit into the coaches development program.	
3	Also what you guys are doing over there cross it right if I know yeah, we just had one last week and it went phenomenal it was and I failed the listeners because I was going to do a podcast with the three participants because they all really wanted to do one but we just got so entrenched into the development portion that like I just finished day 3 and I like shit we forgot we forgot to do that like yeah, I was that the I was I was reflecting on this on the summit and I wrote an email to say thank you to a couple people and and the email I kind of Express I said I find it very rare that you could find yourself in a position to earn a living doing truly what you love like what is actually your passion and then it's even more rare than that to be surrounded by people who were just as passionate as you and that I felt like I hit the lottery by Being able to do what I love and be surrounded by people who are literally just as passionate about it. And I was just like thank you for this opportunity like I could imagine myself in any other place.	
1	Yeah, you have to live living your life. Any other way is just not worth it. You know, I mean that standing around the water cooler another day another dollar groans and whatnot with the other people in the miserable corporate life nothing wrong with it if you enjoy it, but but getting caught in the rat race is yeah.	
3	Definitely you got to try to pursue something that your Bubbles and you can infiltrate your life with happiness and your day-to-day work and I think what's cool about that is it and you kind of see it when you look inside like that people's kind of like their personal bubbles if we're going to use that term like it's infection. It's infectious, right? Because I mean how many how many people have you had that have kind of been under your tutelage over the years that have ended up working on seminar staff?	
1	Oh my gosh. Well, let's see it started with the Charlesworth. Yeah, the Charlesworth Jenna and Drew they both got on staff. My wife Liz she is on the kid staff and then we also my son-in-law Callen Talent CD is on staff and also Dennis Martin who is no longer on staff, but but he was on staff or a little bit. So that would be I have five people they could then they all came through a 100 CrossFit and and they just got passionate about CrossFit and it's kind of neat because you know, they leave and move on which is devastating to have these wonderful trainers leave and move on. Of course, my wife didn't leave she still around but they have these two had to have that, you know, it's devastating with the same time. It's kind of a neat little in a weird way. It feels like an act of philanthropy almost that they're off. Leading these great communities now and loving their job day to day which is unless I hope they were able to steal some of that from working at eight 100 and learning about think way.	
3	I definitely think it's something you should be proud of and that's kind of what I wanted to ask you because that's always been my vision is to have you know, something similar like I always envisioned like the coaches. I admire the most or the coaches who have had coaches that have left and then gone on to do things like Bill Parcells comes to mind like the number of head coaches in the NFL that started under Bill Parcells and then went on to do something else Nick Saban's and other one like that is what I like not how many championships you have. But like the number of people that went on to do great things after being in your presence is like what I consider like the true Mark of success like is that something Like how do you transmit like for somebody who's owns a gym? Like you've owned a gym for almost 10 years? Like how do you begin to start to transmit that culture onto your other staff when they come in?	
1	Well, you know what? I mean? I think it just I think it just kind of I think it just kind of organically happens. You know, I don't think we start with a new coach. Just immediately start thinking about you know, what the end goal is going to be. We just you know, just show it just try to just try to love them. Make sure you know be open to the idea that they're going to make mistakes because before you know when before you are a great coach you have to be a bad coach has to start somewhere and I think just being open to that idea and realizing that the only real mistake you make is the mistake you when When you don't get back up after you fall down and just kind of always being there for them. And and then I think in the beginning what we do with our younger coaches is we kind of spell things out very much for them about how things are going to be. We guess you could compare to like fishing like when I was a little boy my dad would take me fishing he would he would he would he tie the knot you put he he put the bait on the lure and he said that he would throw it out. He would throw it out in the fish of white heat set the hook and he give me the point. I'd reel it in in the beginning. That's kind of what we do with with our trainers is we just lay it all out and then as they get used to reel in the fish or running the class and what now, we start to give them a little bit more creative freedom to start to grow into their own and trusting them with that process. And yeah, they just kind of they just kind of come along and then eventually they're great. They're setting their own hook.	
3	What's the first so on that middle? What's the first thing? You allow a new coach to do like what's the first thing you're like. Hey, you can do this by yourself.	
1	Yeah, usually it's usually it will start with some of the more complex progressions like for it. Well, I'll just use an arbitrary example. Maybe we're going to do ring muscle obstinate workout today. And so I've got some I've got two or three pre-populated ring muscle-up progressions that I like to put the athletes through a tunnel CrossFit and like if you're a new coach then then you're automatically doing these a 100 default progressions the It progressions but then after a while maybe we'll put a charge on our coaches as we see their experience level take off a little bit. Maybe maybe now it's going to be there like hey, why don't you know, you're going to do a muscle-up progression. Why don't you go into the Batcave come up with your own little twist on things and put your own little you're a little creativity stamp on it and and then so it's still within the context of the timeline, but usually that's We're and then and then we and then you know also with General warm-ups and whatnot. We've got some pre-populated general warm up some very popular ones that I like to use that are out from my arsenal of coaching but then we decided eventually handing those little will become like evolutions of the class over to the so they can kind of vary away from it a little bit but it's a tricky Bird right? Because you know what? You don't want to have you don't want it. You don't want to have too much discrepancy between your three o'clock in your 6:30 p.m. You know, you don't like coaches coming in at 3 because they are our clients coming in at 3 because well, this coach has a better progression than this coach has so it's a tricky little bird to maybe then that as you start trusting your coaches, maybe maybe then that becomes a new default affiliate muscle-up progression. So that way the 6:30 class copies the same thing that the three o'clock coach created. Yeah. I was going to be this you that like that.	
3	I was going to ask you how much standardization you have within your you're kind of class procedures because that's that was an error. I made early on which I kind of gave everybody, you know all the rope in the world to hang themselves. And then and then we went we swung the pendulum all the way the other direction or say you're going to do everything exactly like this and we took away all poetic freedom. And now we lie probably somewhere in the middle where there are there are certain things that are standardized. We don't we don't change the snatch progression. We don't change The Pusher progression. We don't change the pull up progression, but outside of that like if you want to sprinkle some Other things in there as you get better than I'll let you do that but first kind of where you are going is like you have to show me that you can set the hook exactly. Like I taught you how to set it and then once you can do that repeatedly, then I'll let you kind of, you know, we venture out and get a little bit creative. But for me, I find that the best the best way to move coaches forward is like hey demonstrate the template first show me that you can follow directions in the you understand this then you can be creative but not until then. Mmmmm.	
1	Yeah, absolutely. And that is that and kind of like what you said earlier like lose some of the great conversations we've had has been about entrepreneurship and whatnot. And the first part of Entrepreneurship is dialing in on the way you want things done for your business and then you hand those off. So so what you said is like that Baseline that's basically the safety net for every single code that comes in and in the beginning in the beginning as an early affiliate or you have to do exactly what you and I did you have to just come up with this is our muscle up progression. This is our this is our Kipping pull-up for Gretchen. This is a now we have two of these progressions. And now we have two of these progressions and to the now we have three and now that we have these Baseline in these safety nets for our new coaches. Now that they can demonstrate they have those then you can start to move away, but you can't write you can't start the opposite way. You can't give them create a freedom giving them create a freedom without a safety net to fall back on almost seems unfair and I literally it almost seems like you're going to see and correct but you going to start to see and Correct somebody before you before you teach them.	
3	Yeah, it's and you know you end up setting them up for failure because they end up falling on their face anyway, because you know trying to recreate the wheel is generally never a good idea. But then then the other thing that becomes a problem from a business standpoint is you create this this pretty significant discrepancy from class to class or from coach to coach, you know, if I'm talking it all off, you know, if I'm talking about offering a consistent service or product there has to be it. A pretty substantial amount of ability to replicate the service from one co-ceo. They can all have their flight like the way I like to describe it as like I want you to be you and I want you to put whatever spin on this you want, but it doesn't change the content kind of like we do the level ones like the content doesn't change the delivery and who's giving the lecture in the flavor which with which it's given that varies from person to person as they get comfortable with the content. I feel like coaching is the same way don't you don't need to change the clean? Like it's good the way it is, what you need to do is figure out how to deliver it effectively being you.	
1	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then the art continues when you not only develop like your own unique way to deliver in that instruction for the clean, but when you can become a chameleon to the environment that you are with, you know, like as you are literally looking out onto your class as a coach and you're running through your your very best Queen progression and you start to pick up on like oh my gosh these we are These clients are these participants learning this clean progression for me right now are not quite as advanced or or maybe they're more advanced than what I thought and your ability to kind of adjust your progression mid way to meet the demands of or the needs of the clients in the class. That's another part of the art right where gosh, I mean you could have you could have 10 old hands in the class or you could have eight newbies into Old hands in the class. And being able to balance the education with still not being you having to bore the old hands but give the education to the to the newbies at the same time. Yeah, that's that's a continuation of the art right there.	
3	Yeah, we get that question quite a bit when we because when we're working with coaches either in the mentor group of people ask questions about when they when they do their lesson plans in a question of etiquette and evidently comes up about what if I've got like this big mix of athletes are have this these athletes that are all pretty much good to go. And my statement everybody's like it shouldn't matter. It doesn't change the plan and this is something jog Xander told me years ago. He says and I'm going to butcher this a little bit but he's like hey what you want to become able to do as a professional is either contract or expand the content at Will based on the audience that you're looking at and yeah, as long as the yeah, that's that's an art form that I still work on constantly as like hey Can I fast-forward this do I need to lengthen this out but I still have not mastered that I think I'm just significantly better at it than it was 10 years ago, but it's still something that I'm constantly evaluating because you know the the athletes change every day, which is really kind of the fun part of the whole thing.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. No, do you have no doubt about it? Yeah, and you only learn by by doing it, right and you got to put your hand on a hot stove a couple times by realizing like wow that I really just over Coach that group of people, you know here I am dropping all my all my knowledge bombs and they they're looking at you like you got three heads where it could have been very appropriate for the last class. You know, I'm just because they're just so maybe they're more experienced class.	
3	I did that just the other day where where I had if you to watch both the classes back to back they would have they could not have been more different but it was just literally based on the people that I have in the class. I just decided on the Flyers like I'm gonna change this just because because I think it's appropriate based on this, but I wanted to go back to something you said earlier because this idea of like letting people mess up is a hard pill to swallow particularly went as a business owner when those decisions and those mess-ups can in a lot of instances cause you money like how long did it take you? To really take out on board and start to be okay with that.	
1	Well, I think you know really I think from the beginning. I was not not to sound like a know-it-all I guess but I just knew I mean when I came into CrossFit, which would have been about 12 or 13 years ago, right? There just wasn't a lot of Affiliates around. I mean, I think there was only one good CrossFit coach in all of the state of Michigan when when I first started 12 or 13 years ago and it was it was quite a I have to get there. So I mean when I started coaching CrossFit, I started coaching at the high school kids when I started and and I would just in I was just messing up, you know, I would just just mess up with these kids and then I would have to change things and derive things and then when I got confident enough, I'd eventually I left I was a school teacher and I eventually left that profession to open my own affiliate. I think I just had a lot of empathy for my coaches because I remember the past. Last two or three years of the learning curve that I had been going through with coaching. We're just felt like I was constantly put my hand on a hot stove and right the only thing put your hand on a hot stove. They'll the worst thing you could do is just put your hand back on the same hot stove. Of course, it's gonna be hot. So I mean I've done that so many times that I just said I just said he with them that they would that they would I got to be patient with them, but they're going to make mistakes.	
3	I was reading somewhere the other day. It was just it was this Remember where I got it from but it was probably on somebody's Instagram feed but it was like, you know how to make good decisions and it was like get experience. How do you get experience make bad decisions and I was like, oh that's a that's a very accurate. It's a very accurate description of how that whole process works and it's tough because like you you there is frustration involved with teaching people something new and again not to beat it like one of my members who's a friend and mentor mind like super super successful entrepreneur and he works in in like the fast food industry and he owns a couple Chick-fil-A's but he says Hey listen people are going to mess things up five times. Like you have to give them five opportunities to mess it up in generally by then. They'll probably do it better than you and I was like man that seems like a lot it seems like a lot of times it has up.	
1	But yeah, and that's all works another part. That's another tricky part of it is Yeah, making them better than you and not letting your own ego get in the way. That is a I can I can like I guess talk about the learning curves of going through my own your own as a new coach to learn things. And then you start to spread that wealth to others than the first time that you start to realize that the person you're tutoring is becoming better than you you almost want to be like well, wait a minute. Maybe I don't want to give them any more knowledge. There's this there's a selfish side of you. That is that I think is normal and organic but to be able to slice up your Humble Pie and take big bites of it and realize that that is actually what part of leadership is is if you can if you can have the humility and be proud to bring people along that path that it is. Okay, and it's a totally normal part of leadership to have your subordinates or your your coaches at your training to become actually better than you and I feel like that quite often. We're some of those names we mentioned earlier. I mean I watch these guys run a classes and I'll be like damn. I wish I was that good and and I'll tell them afterwards. I'm like gosh that was amazing. I'm going to try to steal that. I don't know if I can replicate it, but I'm sure it's it going to try to steal it. And yeah, that's that's that's a new learning curve that you have to go through eventually with as an affiliate owner. I think and as you're trying to bring up good coaches is there get let Um get better than you let them I think I think that's hard to swallow. Sometimes.	
3	I I can definitely understand how people could feel that way. I might be an outlier here, but for whatever reason and I'm not saying this is due to anything specific I did or I'm special it probably parenting but I've never been that way. Like I always looked at it a little bit differently like I'm in I'm an Uber competitive person and and and I don't necessarily have the desire to win. I just like competition. So I always looked at it like as somebody get better like I always excited because now there was more competition. Like I knew that as this person got better my competitive nature would take over and I would also get better. So I always looked at it like as you get better. It's going to force me to get better and at that that's probably not normal, but I've always that's always been excited to deciding to me like when I played baseball and basketball and football growing up when I played in college and like guys would be getting better like it just Got me excited. Like I was just like I was like hell, yeah, I'm like, this is like the competition is about to go up a notch and that was always what I looked looked for and I do and I do it now as a coach like I find it exciting because now I'm going to start to steal from that person to like I'm gonna steal the things that they do and try to improve.	
1	Yeah, I get it you got another outlet that I get it you got another outlet another opportunity to steal. Yeah. I loved it. That's a great lens. That is such a healthy lens. That's a great way to have an outlook on things. It reminds me of My competitive days of wrestling where I always I always felt like my Pitfall of wrestling was that I looked at wrestling. I didn't look at it. Like I was wrestling to win. I wrestled not to lose. And you can never win that way, right? You can never yeah, when if you wrestle not to lose you have to play to win and you like it and that would be like if you if you are afraid to let your your coaches if you're afraid to let them grow into something better which eventually means I mean, they're going to move on, you know, they're they're good. They're going to move on they're going to do bigger and better things. We all sell all breakups.	
3	Look the same. Yeah that was act like we all break up and if you're trying to hold people in It's never going to work out.	
1	Like I prefer to look at it that is playing that's playing not to lose right? That's what I'm playing to win being in it to win. It is going to be like, oh great. Look at this. I got another Avenue another another person I can steal from now and you just created that for yourself. That's a great lens. It's such a healthy ones and way to look at things.	
3	I can't take credit for that. I don't know why I'm like that because it's weird because I hate losing right like it's just like I hope that well, I don't know if that's accurate. I don't know that I hate losing I I feel like I've told Joe Alexander this for I have a profound fear of mediocrity right like that. That's why probably what drives me like I don't I realize that losing is part of life. But like I guess what probably drives me is like I have like it scares the crap out of me to be mediocre at things. There's some things like that. I don't care about that. I'm like, I'm never gonna be good at that. Like I'm just gonna but it's not part of my life so I don't care but like when it comes to the things that I'm doing and I'm passionate about like being mediocre at those things like is incredibly frightening to me and I think that's what drives it. It's not like my desire to be great. It's my fear of being terrible. And I think that that's helpful, you know and like something I've been struggling with and we like in this is on the business mindset and I love to get your idea. Like have you read have you read any of Simonson textbooks like start with Y or anything like that?	
1	No, I have not. I have been referred multiple times to the bucks, but I have not read any of his books.	
3	So his his newest book is called. The infinite game and basically the premise of the book is to in order to be successful particularly like in life and business trying to win as how you fail. There is no there is no winning. There's simply staying in the game and having to shift and having to shift my mindset particularly on business on that has been has been a struggle because I'm I was always in the mind. So we've got to win we have to we have to either close the sale or we have to you know, grow this much or we have to you know be better than this. Business and then all of that is short-term thinking and I've really had to like take a step back and look at it and say like what am I actually what I'm actually winning like what like like how do you approach business? Because I like em that shifts for me quite a bit and I'm trying to get better at it.	
1	You know, I think I like to approach a kind of you said something earlier about I forgot exactly what we talked about earlier in this podcast for we mentioned something along the idea of this like you don't have to start right? You just have to start. Yeah, you suck and I have yep. I have a tendency to try to sink things. Right? I have a tendency to want to think things right and I will sit in the think tank and I will think and I was thinking I was thinking I was thinking I think of a better way to implement this thing and a better way to know. Well what if I change this before I implement it? If I change I think over the year is one thing that I'm starting to realize is I just have to start this process or the standard operating procedure that I'm instead of thinking about it. I can't think it right. I just have to start it and then and then I'll and then I will adjust you know, and that's the same right? That's the same thing that a lot of people need to realize with nutrition as well as like, you know the going got how many calories what percentage of protein what percentage of Fairway, you know, who cares just start. Yes. I don't even care, you know, you could have the most obscene, you know, you could start in the most wrong way like maybe 90% of your intake is going to be from carbohydrate 5% from protein 5% fat as long as you start weighing and measuring your food you're going to realize real quick that you don't like those results and you're going to shift those numbers. So being exactly right and trying to think it right. I have the clients that they've been eating a carbohydrate riddled. Nutrition fiscal regime for other light and now we're going to switch it and it what's the right number is somebody did listen matches just get somewhere in this Arena of 40% to start. You don't have to start it right you just have to start is what you have to do. And I think that's one thing I've learned with with affiliate ownership is just right. I got this great idea High, let's just start it and let's not give up on it when it fails, you know, it's going to fail. Let's just fix it when it does. Make it meet the mold of what you need and Cilia right now.	
3	That's it's interesting. So I would be I would classify myself as the opposite of that when we're like my tendency is to let's not build the plane. Let's just start flying and build the plane in midair which yes, yeah. It's as is which also has its drawbacks and there's this I think I read this and I think it was a Stanley McChrystal book. I think it was in team of teams when he talks about this concept of the cathedral and The bizarre and is like, you know, there's two concepts right? This Cathedral is this immaculately structured thing and it's every brick is placed against, you know, super precisely and it's this beautiful structure the problem with the cathedral is it takes two centuries to build it, you know, but it's perfect when you're done. So it's a it's a it's an efficiency thing and the opposite end of the spectrum is the bizarre, right? So if anybody's ever been to a bizarre, if you've never been to the Middle East or anything like that, you know, like the bizarre is this crazy kind of Market Place that nobody really knows how it functions. There's no rules. There's no structure but it functions like it's this place of trade that functions but like but you can't change anything in the bizarre right like it because nobody knows how it works the problem with the cathedral though is like if I change something I continue to push the timeline back so it's like how do I become some version of both the cathedral and the bazaar which is like have some structure and some logic to my thought but not let the Perfect Design hold me back from actually starting the project. So that's where I try to live my life, but I but I tend towards the bazaar which is like let's just figure it out and that has bitten me on that's just more than a ton more than a couple occasions have to be a little bit better about that.	
1	The woman big theme of other stuff we've talked about is like the the darn the darn fairy tale of Goldilocks, right? Like not too hot not too cold. I think it's almost everything we've talked about so far is like you can be at one end of the spectrum where I on the other hand his football would I we we find is right in the middle is where you need to be.	
3	But again, like how do you get to the middle like you only get to the middle by spending too much time on the periphery. Like you're just like this is not where I want to be and if so and you somehow figure out how to gravitate towards the middle, you know, if you're being intelligent about it.	
1	Yeah and what you said staying in the game staying in the game, that's the key is you got to stay in the game. You got to adjust you can't just take that plan because you know, the umbrella concept of that plan is good. You just have to figure out how to nail that umbrella concept what you're trying to get wet. Not give up on it because you're too much like the bizarre too much like the cathedral. Yeah, I love that.	
3	So on that note what are some of the what are some lessons learned as an affiliate owner that you would pass on to people so like again not a ton of us who have been around 10 years, which doesn't necessarily make us good. Right? I think that's what yeah, it does. It does. It does mean that we're still in the game though, and there's been some lessons learned along the way like, what are some of the black what some of the big takeaways that if you reflect on ten years and you sit down and You would lose her drinking wine and I like what would you be? What would you be your big takeaway is like things that you've either done poorly or things. You're like we nailed it on that like we definitely got that right.	
1	Yeah, well, that's great. Oh my gosh. Wait, isn't that a tough one? I guess some I guess the you know in the beginning it's kind of funny, you know in the You know what? I think your needs kind of change over the years your needs kind of changed over the years to about what you're doing right at that time and and whatnot because I mean there's a whole concept of taking care of the people that are under your umbrella right. Now the people who you are your current clients and and somehow managing to still pull more clients in I've done both I've done both ways, you know, I've done just Like all I'm going to do is I'm just going to concentrate on my count on my clients and offer quality service to them and I've gotten very very happy with with very experienced and what they're having at eight one old CrossFit and then and then just started to rely on that to bring other people in through Word of Mouth which it does but it's not like a crazy. It's not like I have people just knocking down my door. I've had to experiment also with getting my name out there to try to get people to come in the door, so Then that because so then you start to focus on that item and kind of like we were saying before then all of a sudden you you start to lose focus of the people who are in your gym in the quality control drops there because you're too focused on drawing people into your gym. So you shift back and then I don't know then then how do you want to take care of the people in your gym? I would say the big what would be the big take away the number one take away the sum that we have mailed. I think I think just just being consistent with the cross it methodology and not watering it down like consistently challenging people to build their gymnastic skills cons, like looking after people that are under our brother under our roof constantly challenging them not not watering down not getting caught up in the new sexy thing in the fitness industry. Re and going off on some tangent. Now all of a sudden you're not the CrossFit methodology anymore that has been a something that we've done well, and then with which is making sure we have consistent benchmarks for athletes that they're familiar with always participating in the open and making the open something fun that people can celebrate the celebration of lifestyle of being a crossfitter. I think that I think this sticking to the roots of CrossFit. It is something that we've done. Well that I'm that I'm pretty proud of because I think there's a lot of tangent you can go off and you know, you see this happening all the time, right? You see some CrossFit Affiliates changing the name to like such and such strength and conditioning because they don't want to be for whatever reason they lose track of they got caught in some new sexy thing. They went off on a tangent in the fitness industry and they didn't want to be pigeonholed into whatever they think the cross it methodology is or whatever misconception they have, you know, I get what you're saying, and I don't know.	
3	Or even fault those people for that. Like I don't I don't I disagree with it, but I get how it's easy to to want to take the new shiny object because I mean if you give anybody the option like hey, what's the easier route like continue to try to get better at the thing that you're doing or go chase this thing over here, like chasing. The new thing is always easier, you know realistically than it is to like particularly as you get better at something. It's like it gets better it gets harder and harder to improve 1% if your As you and become really competent with something as like, how do you you know, how does somebody like Joe to gain or as a Flowmaster who runs an affiliate for 10 years, like improve his affiliate like we all know it can be done but I would argue that it just does get more complicated and does get harder the longer you've been doing it.	
1	Yeah, yeah, definitely definitely and we've come across some standard operating procedures across the way that and I know this is where you and I really can go down the rabbit hole with yeah, and we start talking about those things that we have learned to this kind of recreate and we're starting to fall into a little bit of like a template that allows us to have no goal meetings with our athletes and then challenges with our athletes when our benchmarks going to happen.	
3	But I've got a job with your structure there because I think that's one of the that's like a major retention tool that people are that are missing. Like how do I how do I have consistent frequent replicatable retention strategies in place for the people when they're when they're in my care right to take somebody's average, you know, they're lengthen engagement, which is what Chris Cooper likes their leg to take it from three months to two years. Like what do you guys have in place to do that?	
1	Well, yeah, we're and it's evolving we have gone from you know, we used to have this really interesting. We used to we used to have these goal meetings that we would do throughout the entire year and we would call people like like if you were a member of my gym we would call you like every three or four months and try to set up this meeting with you is what we would do and then you Coming to this meeting. It was kind of like a mandatory thing you'd come in for this meeting. We talked about your goals and it was just a chance to sit down with an individual find out how things are going and a lot of times to be honest with you would turn into a little bit of a therapy session that you would just have to hear about all these different reasons as to why the person can't make it into the gym, but I'll never about likeness.	
3	It's literally never about this.	
1	And yeah, we it's so we would do those but they were just I don't know it was it was like we tried to spread them out throughout the course of the Year, and so the so the volume wouldn't be that aggressive and and it just became really tricky and we kind of got away from that. Just last year in this new year 2020. I'm kind of looking forward to this idea of just making like Gene in January of this year. I would really dislike to hunker down and meet with every single one of my clients just to be able to talk about like, where are you? Where do you want to go? We write something down that would help you for the next six months something to get use kind of square way a little bit right now or give you some resources and just let them know we care for them. And then but in order to do that in order to do that, you have to in order to in order to have anything to talk about you have to have data in front of you about your athletes, you know, you can't otherwise it's just a subjective sit down of like I don't know. What is your clean? I don't know. What is your body fat percentage? I don't know what You know we look at all these if you can look at all these different metrics. So so before that even can happen before you can have those meetings in those gold meetings with your athletes having some type of a metric system to be able to gather data on your athletes. You can sit down and look at them across from the desk with a piece of paper that has things that are relevant to them that are data-driven and I'm so that's a whole other process in itself and I would love to use the open as an opportunity to do that and the open but the open only really gives us that And work out but there's only going to be one repeat workout and there's so many factors change the you can't base. You can't base like well, I was in the top, you know 40th percentile last year and this year. I'm in the top 35th percentile you have no I'd look at how many of the numbers are changing of the participants in the open. That's just a hard. It's a hard one to measure your you definitely get that one repeatable workout that you can compare two years past to see if you are improving your not. But so we like to look at the open kind of like as a huge celebration of lifestyle and participate in these five crazy weeks with some of the fittest people in the world. And then now that that's over we are doing right now before Christmas before the new year. Our game plan is to have a whole slew of benchmarks and data and then of course as soon as January hits then we want to do some Sorry metrics such as body fat percentage muscle mass and whatnot. And then we want to sit down and have meetings with people about like all right, this is where you were in the open at the end of 2019. This is where you are in all of our benchmarks. This is where this is what your body fat percentage your muscle mass your visceral fat inflammation levels. This is where you are right now. And so where do you want to go from here? And that's kind of a neat little I don't know. I'm pretty happy with the way that looks from is that can be October September September what august/september you're probably going to August you start getting nervous about the open September you start doing some things that might get you in the open type mindset. And then what was it October and November we kind of went through the yeah open experience and now we can test on these so that's not no that's a third of the Year eating up right there. Yeah, but I think you're gonna need a muse.	
3	Like the key now is like is like finding that new schedule because like for us like we didn't have a ton of compared to what we normally have of participation in the open. I think it was just because like people were just still kind of exhausted from the games, you know, like just the idea of it in general. Everybody's like, oh man. This is like really quick again to do this all over again. So we probably had 50% participation, but I think that will go back up next year. Because there's gonna be so much lead time going into it.	
1	I think it'll be better if anyone has a lot of people a lot of people didn't do the open. I think they were just like, oh my gosh, that's so quick. So it's a fast turnaround. Oh my God, but I got to believe that if you didn't do the open and I could be misspeaking, but if you didn't do the open you had to have been watching from a distance and yeah, which is always really good to work out anyways. It's just what it is and then you just got on the leaderboard and quiet shame in your closet and looked it up look up to the where you were you would have been if you would have had to the open. Yeah.	
3	Yeah, I agree. I think I think what everyone wants this is like that weird transition here where everything just feels discombobulated, but I think it'll settle in going into next year. Now that now that everybody knows like the open is not in february/march anymore now, it is in October. So I think it'll work itself out one of the Other things I wanted to ask you was like you have played around probably more than anybody I know with like trying to weave nutrition into your members, like either memberships or like how you do it and stuff like that. And I think last time we talked which is a while ago, you had a significant number of people who were doing some sort of nutrition protocol with you.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, we did. Yeah. Well, you know, we did we actually made it mandatory in our gym for a little bit. So for a while we had a hundred percent. It was mandatory and essentially what we did we don't do this anymore. I can't say that this was a bad idea either. We just had like every three months every month on your membership. There was a $25 charge that came through and this was kind of how we did the those mandatory meetings because a lot of times, you know, a lot of times that's where people need most help app. We get the 1 hour in the day to help them with their metabolic conditioning in the gymnastics and their and their weight lifting but they got 23 hours in the day to screw up in nutrition. So that's usually where people need most guidance from. Yeah. So what we would do is every every three months your account as a member of the gym your accounts charged 25 bucks and you get a we use we use a software a membership software that will allow for appointments. So you're the so this appointment just shows up in your in your in your smartphone on our on our app And and then you have 30 days to schedule an appointment with us and where you're going to come in and you're going to get on the in Body Machine and you're going to get all of your metrics and we're going to talk about nutrition and talk about like hey, what would this is where you were three months ago? This is where you are. Now, it looks like everything's going just fine or do you want to get better or will you do want to change anything or just it just seems like it's almost negligent. If you don't at least check in every three months and sometimes, you know three months. You know, somebody would not see any change and they would be happy and they just kind of be sitting there and they wouldn't really be inspired to make any changes. But sometimes especially with some of our older people like they would come in. They'd be like, oh my gosh, my body fat percentage went up by one and a half percent. They go what's changed and they say nothing. Well, your metabolism is changed, you know, you're changing now like you're just I mean, it's obvious when you go from 15 to 25 that your metabolism changes, but then as you start to get older your You're that code that metabolic code is always changing and it was kind of nice to be able to catch people every three months because they would just see a little increase in percentage percentage body fat. It look man. I've been feeling a little bit chubbier, but I guess I really am and then they yeah they just about really there.	
3	Is that really their metabolism or is that more along the lines of what kind of what you got were discussing beforehand, which is you live in Michigan like there is seasonal depression people are inside for longer periods of time. Like is it really their? Ilysm that will cause their body found to go up one and a half percent and three months or did they have some habits and lifestyle just stuff that changed.	
1	Yeah, you know, you're absolutely right. It could it could be a zillion different things. It could be a zillion different things, right? It is hard. It is hard to dial in to figure out but I guess the overarching principle right is just like, oh my gosh, you're something has to do something has to change now because it doesn't matter if you're seasonally day your body has no regard to your seasonal depression or to your changing metabolism. It's going to get fat. That if you don't change something right now with whatever you've been doing for the past three months.	
3	Yeah, and I think that's the beauty of and like one of the things that we're trying to get people to do more freely now is like blood work, you know, it's like the more things that I can do more things that we can get athletes to present themselves with whether it's body composition blood work or their log book the less opportunity. There is for them to like a cop-out or like lie to themselves right? Like you can't lie about any of those things. You can't say that like every year training consisted. Lie that your nutrition is dialed in if your workouts are going down if your body if I put if your body composition is going in the wrong direction. And if your brother blood lipid profile is gotten worse, like something is going wrong, you know, and you can you can't tell can you can't tell me that you're doing what you're supposed to you know what I mean?	
1	Yeah, and those meetings are really hard to do without that. That's that you got it and you have to figure out what do you want? It's almost like you have to reverse engineer the project. What are you what do you want to talk about at this sit down and if blood lipid profiles are part of it and those other metrics is that you can't just sit down and be like, hey man, I just want you to know I'm trying really hard for you and I hope you're doing well, but we don't have anything to really talk about. I mean that meeting is useless parties. Yeah, and yeah, so that's what we Kind of we thought about how to integrate blood work is well into our gym. So I'm sure you and I will have more future talks about that escopeta.	
3	We just well, yeah, I mean we all know we can have right now. We just rolled out some stuff from the warrior Clinic which is from dr. Scott and Chaka Glenn. So Scott was at the trainer Summit very briefly, I think. He's there for a day but Shaka is is coach glassman's kids pediatrician and so they started the warrior king of I do, you know her. Yep. Yep, where they can where you can go in and order a kit. So the kit gets mailed to you you do a finger prick and then you mail it back and then they they will go through all of your stuff with you and now you have a dashboard and you can do this periodically throughout the year and it's like it's a very very cost-effective you get to you get to forgo all of the crap about trying to get some blood work from your doctor. To order the blood work like and then having to go back and get your results and all that stuff like so it's just really really efficient way to do it.	
1	So that's what we're really it's called The Warrior the warrior kit clinic.	
3	So it's called The Warrior Clinic. Okay. Yeah the where Clinic.com I believe and then in there you order the kit and you can do two different types of kits in there. But all of all of us have seen their all of the testing that they do is based on what they feel are the the most appropriate story. I'm looking for chronic disease markers, right? They like these are the things that we know definitively are like have strong Association to you know, metabolic derangement and chronic disease.	
1	And now how is it different than what inside track. Are you familiar with inside tracker?	
3	I am not as familiar. I don't know that it's much different. I think they're probably very Homeowner like I think this is a space that a lot of people are getting into. I just really like those two to be honest with you.	
1	They're both crossfitters and their interest in the space and right right like I don't let me ask you this with that with with that Warrior Clinic when you order let's say I want to order something. Can I can I order that and this is an important question. I think as an affiliate owner can I order that? Can I just order 10 of these and sell them in my gym or when you order one is it? Typically registered to you and it shows up registered to you when you get it or they blink kits that you can anybody could just send in.	
3	You know, that's a good question. I don't know. I mean, I guess if I guess like it doesn't really matter until you send it back I can ask though.	
1	I don't know that's a good guess because that was one thing that was one beef I had with inside tracker is I wanted to start putting these finger Pricks because that's what they have is the think of brake system and I wanted to do but I but I but I but they wouldn't let me order 10 of them, too. On a shelf and sell it my affiliate because I wanted honor. I really just wanted to look at somebody in the eye and be like look the thing is sitting right here. You can send it in tonight rather than telling somebody about this at this website. They have to go through and that's obstacle always leads to a week later. They're like, oh yeah or two months later on. Yeah. I told me about it, but I never went to the website, but if it's sitting there on yourself, I always felt like that was something better.	
3	I will ask is I'm going to have them back on. The show because we're going to do a Q&A with them, but I will ask because that's a good that's a good question. All right, we're getting we know this for almost an hour, which I which I had no doubt we were going to do. I've got a couple more questions for you. What is one of the biggest mistakes you've made as an affiliate owner?	
1	Biggest mistake I've ever made as an affiliate owner is that bigger is better?	
3	No not because I actually want to do I'm glad you said that because I actually want to do like a multi-person podcast with with gym owners who have had multiple Affiliates and then contracted back to one.	
1	And at my original a my original gym that we had we probably had about I'd say we had about 3,000 to 4,000 square feet and it was I really loved it and behind behind my unit was like 7,000 more square feet that I could tap into if I wanted to so immediately. I was I'd always been looking at this 7,000 square feet like all as soon as we're big enough. I'm going to get it as soon as our and I got it and we put all this Turf down back. Are we put another rig up back there? And and really, you know, one of the things we got going for us in this in these Affiliates, I think the community and the intimacy of the community and in my experience when I plugged into that 7,000 square feet. I ended up with like four or five people way over in this corner talking. I had two or three people way over and here I had one guy with his headphones on and one section of the gym and we kind of lost the intimacy of our community and I don't think people felt as connected and slowly the overtime, you know, it's not something that just happens in one day but slowly over time. I started to realize like that tightness of the community had been kind of woven apart and I eventually shut down not because he was even like a price gig I just didn't like the feel of my community anymore. So I shut that back down and made it small again is what I did and I liked it and then it's and then and then we and then we started to go. I meet people I don't want people to be in danger when they're working. Out but I like them to have to be close to each other a little bit and I think it's healthier for that gym environment and then I put my hand on the hot stove again because I opened up another affiliate and we had to affiliate. Yeah, and then we had to Affiliates. We opened one up about 20 minutes down the road and Coach Glassman always said if you think you run a good affiliate to open up another one and you will run to half as well, and of course I didn't listen I put my hand on her ass. Stove again. I open up a second affiliate. And then I knew I was in over my head one day when I was at that affiliate. I called to members by the wrong name and then I went back to my original affiliate to run another couple classes and I called two more people from my original affiliate by the wrong name and I was like, I'm in over my head. I don't I'm not saying it can't be done. I know it can be done, but it's not for me. So for me every time and then it now Sold that second affiliate and I'm back to my original affiliate which is eight will know and for me getting thinking bigger is better was my was my personal mistake. And I know a lot of people are successful with I'm running multiple gyms, but I think just for me I'm a little bit more. I'm a little bit more in the trenches. I like to be in the trenches a little bit. Yeah. I definitely want I want to be able to step out of the trenches when I want to I want to be able to have that kind of freedom, but I do like still being Hands-On in my affiliate. And so those are those are my two biggest mistakes thinking bigger is better.	
3	Yeah, I agree with you I go I this is something that just rattles around in my brain almost constantly is the vast majority of people that I know that if that have done multiple ciliates have contracted back to one at some point and I don't I don't think it's because it can't be done because I do know people who are doing it successfully. It's a very very small percentage. I mean, it is definitely less than 1% of the CrossFit community.	
1	Hey, you're doing it right now. Right? Are you still have two locations know so we can track?	
3	Well, we were forcing like that's a whole nother story on me do a podcast on just like just sometimes bad luck is a thing but it's yeah, it's it's still dealing with the right now, but the I do think there were some errors that I made there which were not necessarily thinking bigger is better but like I do think the Cross Fit model because it's So intimate because it's so because of what we do is is fairly complex. I think it is very difficult to replicate and Ida people that do replicate it in in my experience and do something that is that is far simpler from a from a from a training standpoint. It's much easier to replicate like a simple model like like orange theory or Barry's Bootcamp or eat the frog or something like that where the complexity is removed where I can create standard operating procedures like and how I run every single class. Gasps but when it's CrossFit, we're dealing with you know, very complex Olympic lifting movements with complex-- gymnastics that requires a significant skill set, which I think is harder to replicate so I don't think I think the skill set of great coaches is hard to replicate. I don't think that the that it's difficult to move forward. But I also think that a lot of people myself included do it in a somewhat haphazard manner like I don't think we give it enough thought and and chew on it long enough to say like this is exactly how it's going to One and can I run this second one absent of being there because that you kind of have to like if you're if you wanted to stand on its own feet to two feet. It kind of needs to stand on its own two feet because you just can't be in two places at one time. So I do think that like there's a lot of people they're doing franchise models with different kind of training modalities and that works but I don't think that CrossFit was ever designed with franchising in mind it was done with a lot of one-on-one interaction. Ian, which means I need to be there, you know, so I think that's the big the big hurdle that people have to jump over and very few do it. Well, so I would agree.	
1	Yeah, I love it.	
3	I love it last question man any books or podcast that your hip to right now?	
1	Oh my gosh II have just I've been all over Jaco lately. I've just been listening to Jocko willick and and I love I love his demeanor. I love his outlook on things. I love is he's got a no-bullshit type attitude and I really enjoy listening to him. In fact, I'm reading his children's books with my daughter Kimora right now. Oh nice hand and it Actually, it's really helping her out. She's said some some behavioral things going on and she start realized how she is the one in control of our own behavior. And I think it's a lot of the real a lot of the things that he puts across this in his children's books his what is his quote. His quote is a is his big thing is discipline equals Freedom. Yep, and and that statement really resonates a lot with me that mean it's just to think Like what? What do you want freedom from? What would you like freedom from because everybody there's something that's bothering somebody every something's bothering everybody. And what is that thing once you can identify what that is that is what you want freedom from and to get freedom from that takes discipline in some aspect of your life and be able to recognize. What is the discipline you need to get freedom from that thing that you don't want and it basically means, you know, suffocate all kind of ability towards yourself and Having higher standard for yourself and I really been listening to a lot of his his podcast lately when it's actually one of the episode 1 seventh floor is about the eminent human and he kind of goes through the Marine the Marine ranking system about how they evaluate and any kind of but he translates that over to real life. And you know, how could you evaluate your own life based upon these same standards at the Marines have in their ranking system where they have like a five star ranking system and like I'm the first First they don't have anything for number one and number two number three is like you do everything really really well. Got it, and they don't even write anything down 1 and to paste your out you can even be in if you're a one or two, but you're not doing things well, and then four and five are like really hard, you know, and you just probably went through this with the with the CrossFit evaluation. You probably had to do on yourself. We're like a 3 is actually pretty good your if you read what it says to be a 3 on the CrossFit headquarter staff. You're like man, I assume he is a good yeah three is a good	
3	Like three is like not average the way we would think about it. The other way I've heard that explained is like, you know, great things on a scale of 1 to 1 to 10, but seven is not an option. None of you ever heard that right. So like you can rank 1 to 10, but you can't but you can't use 7 because 7 is ever that safe number the like, oh, it's pretty good. But if you think about it, if you give yourself to 6, if you give yourself a six-year like just above average, but if you give yourself an eight, you're like that's pretty damn good if I'm in eighth.	
1	Hahaha.	
3	So you really have to be honest with yourself about like hey 7 is not you. There is no 7 because 7 is just something where you put where you put a number there in order to like not actually be critically evaluated either by yourself or by somebody else.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, you're absolutely right. So but yeah, that's a good one is so I've been doing a lot of jacket willing lately and then of course, I'm a big fan of the Primal blueprint. I do a lot of Primal blueprint stuff. I just like listening to those guys talk I have it man.	
3	I haven't listened to that in a long time. I was real I was real heavy on that for a long time, but have not listened to in a long time. Okay. I'm going to get back on that. I'm glad you said that. Cool. We'll listen man we done then. What about Jason? Yeah. This has been more than an hour, which I knew was going to be absolutely necessary to have this conversation.
