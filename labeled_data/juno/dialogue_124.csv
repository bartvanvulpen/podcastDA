1	I have been asked so many times how I got started with my podcast and what made me choose anchor and honestly, it's free. That's the big reason why I wanted to be able to get my story my advice my insight out there for people to hear and people not have to pay to listen to it and also people to be able to You know even make their own podcast or share it with their friends and not feel like you know, they have to pay for a subscription of any kind and I didn't know that if anybody, you know was even going to be listening to my podcast. So it was a big deal for me that it was free and the format was really really easy to use anchor distributes my podcast everywhere so I have listeners on Spotify. Apple you name it that is where the podcast is distributed to and I mean, honestly, you can make money from your podcast. You don't have to have minimum listeners and I don't charge people to listen to my podcast which is incredibly important to me. I just hope that my message gets out there and people are able to listen to it if you want to attempt to, you know, take a step into the podcast. World, I promise you it's incredibly easy anchor walks you through all of it. And I love this platform. I will continue to use anchor as my platform as long as possible. I will not be switching. All you've got to do is download the free anchor app or go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started. I love this podcast platform if you guys have any questions you feel free. To message me. I just love how easy it is. You can even add background music, which I didn't do until my first podcast, but now I've added it in. So if you guys ever have questions about how to get started with a podcast, or why anchor is so amazing. Feel free to contact me. Have a great day. Hi everybody.	
2	I wanted to start doing something a little different with this podcast. I am going to be posting each new podcast as an episode all by itself. So they're a little bit easier to find and then their titles will I guess sort of go along. So this is the first one and I'm just going to call this summer 2019. I wanted to talk about when Trying to make a decision and you know, it doesn't feel right either way like you're very stumped and this kind of goes along with the clearing out of the clutter in your mind and in your life, it's best to just wait it out. I've learned so much in the past two years about how I need to just wait just take some time. Take a couple days. Put it on the Shelf take whatever. Ever it is that you're trying to make a decision about and put it on the shelf and set it to the side once you're able to do that and just let it be usually the right decision comes to you without you even trying in your like. Oh wow, that's that's exactly what I needed and you'll feel very sure about your decision. You will not have any uncertainty you won't feel as if you're rushed into making a decision. It'll just feel right. For example me and my Man, I love my apartment. I've probably mentioned this several times. It's been a place of growth and happiness for me and I'm very comfortable here. I live efficiently. I have money to pay all of my bills. I'm happy and I have been pondering if I want to move out when my lease is up, or if I want to stay here. Well, if I stay here that means I do need to do some serious. as decluttering I should probably get a storage unit so that I can store some things and then go through the excess that I don't need but really, you know, it's it's all the things that come along with moving now if I truly wanted to move out of my apartment the right opportunity I know would come along I would have everything in place including the money I could manifest, you know, really whatever I It as far as moving out goes and finding a new place, but that whole process just has felt. So exhausting to me. I don't even want to think about it. It's been something that has just been kind of like like it's just a heavy feeling and I don't really want it in my focus at all right now, so I have been doing a lot more of just practicing that relaxing feeling. Feeling whenever I think about moving and eyebrows, you know properties that are for rent and I contemplate back and forth. I have about a month to make my mind up and I have pretty much decided that I want to stay in my apartment. I don't want to move. I have no reason to I can live very efficiently here. And once my boyfriend moves here, we can live here together. Totally fine. Absolutely. Not even a problem. Neither one of us really have a A lot of stuff and we want to downsize we love the idea of tiny homes. So this will be a good test for us to do so plus, you know, I'm happy in my apartment community. It's very safe. I know the staff here. I I just I have a very comfortable life and I'm not saying that you know, Comfort should be a reason that you don't, you know explore more later on. But I definitely think that if it feels right that's different than staying in a place and staying stagnant because you're afraid of change now. I'm not afraid of change at all. I know that I could do whatever I wanted as far as moving to a new house, but this just feels like the better decision. Like there's something kind of guiding me to stay here and really, you know, I I also I think that part of it could be from my past. I definitely used to rush into situations and then you know, I want to make sure that even if my my boyfriend and I ended up not working out that I would still be able to afford my place by myself. That's the whole thing. Yes, we could definitely move into a much bigger house. We could have something that would be you know much. Much more spacious a lot more costly as far as rent goes, but I don't want that. I don't want if something were to happen to our relationship. You know that I couldn't afford to live there on my own. I don't want to be forced to move and him move something bad happened like that. I want us to be able to thrive with our extra money that will have staying here and then I also want us Be able to have good experiences and money would not ever be a factor because I can absolutely afford this apartment by myself. So that's a big part of it and yet not saying that I'm prejudging on my relationship isn't going to work. I would never say something like that, but it's the Comfort it's the security and I like that feeling I do. I really enjoy that feeling and it's being smart with my money. So I am not going to increase my debt. Debt and increase my anxiety and increase my worried by putting myself in a situation that feels unstable for me now in a year. Sure. Let's move let's buy a tiny house. Let's do all kinds of things. But right now this is what works best and this is what I'm I'm wanting to do. So I have pondered this so much and mindlessly through scroll through houses for rent over and over again, and I I have just decided I really want to stay in my apartment and won't the ironic thing is probably about the time that I'm ready to re-sign my lease something incredible with like no deposit due and is in my budget and would be great to move into will probably fall right in my lap because that's how it works when you become incredibly happy with what you already have everything you've ever wanted comes right to you. So, you know, here's to uh, here's to Miracles and And having wonderful things sort of just fall in your lap. I'm looking forward to that. Actually. I'm excited to see because I'm so happy my apartment. I'm so excited to see what would come up. Now if I go to the casino and I win, you know a great deal of money, which I've been very good at lately or if I were to win more of the lottery that would be fabulous and I would you know, I would Well, I consider moving at that point but at the same time I you know, I enjoy I enjoy my simple life. I enjoy how easy it is. And I enjoy that it's it is very peaceful. And that is my main goal is to stay peaceful in my life right now.
