1	Hello Morning America.	
3	It's your host Bridget and Caitlin here to talk about your favorite topic our favorite towel thick Disney Channel shows / movies. And today we're going to talk about classic Hannah Montana, of course, so we actually picked basically we were thinking the we're going to start this out as for TV shows will. Two episodes of a TV show and then if we do a movie we'll just just do the movie. So we picked two episodes. The first one is season 1 episode 2 Miley get your gum. And the second one is season 2 episode 20. I will always load you alright.	
2	Okay. So let's talk about the first one. If you want to follow along with us, then pause the podcast and watch the two episodes and then come back and you can comment or let us know what you think about the episodes if we Didn't say something that you want to put out there anyways, so this episode opens with a concert which some of the episodes of Hannah Montana do. I don't know why a lot of the earlier ones. I filled it and I just it's confusing because that it opens with a concert and then I don't know it's like when was it filmed where was it filmed it because it seems like a legit concert, but it's not like in a studio like this a ton of people in the audience. What do you mean? It's not a studio? It doesn't look like a studio film space, you know, like okay, so, you know how like the difference between like for example the set at Rico's and then watching episode of like and emac like the the set is different. Like it looks like a legitimate set it like just like, you know what I mean? Yeah. Anyway, so I feel like the the concert at the beginning that's episode look like a real concert hall and that like a sound stage somewhere and a lot or whatever you think that you don't think are you saying?	
3	That's a bad thing. I'm just	
1	I'm saying I'm dressed like how they even did it.	
2	Yeah, I don't I don't why?	
3	Yeah. Well, I kind of understand why because you know, the the second scene is after the coming out of the concert.	
2	So for this year, so to make sense, however, some of them they do that and like it makes it just opens because they open a lot of the older episodes like that. Yeah, like as I remember I could be definitely wrong. Yeah. I haven't watched any of like the first season a long time.	
3	I do actually think it's a smart idea in terms of like promoting the Album yeah was items although I hate to say it.	
2	Like I've seen this episode a bunch of times and I didn't listen all I knew this one.	
3	It's the song was just like you I knew it but I also listen man Montana a lot. So she's got some good music. I brought absolute pop in all caps.	
2	I really like that song the first thing that like the episode goes into that's plot-based is they actually introduced Lola lilies like alter ego which is amazing and iconic.	
1	And at first I was like, oh,	
2	Okay, so they're introducing Willa and then she just like comes out with a dog and I'm not a dog it is the dog's name is Thor?	
1	Yeah, it's like a little I don't know. What type of dish it's you or something. Yeah, I don't know where it's like definitely a Heritage. Okay. So the thing about the dog is I had a well I have several notes with the dog. They also wrote for - whose dog he wrote did this where did this dog come from?	
2	But I wrote that down but then later I wrote down the the dog was definitely a plot device because the whole point of having the dog was that	
1	Oliver's hand pops into frame which is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen the way his hand Pops in through a limo window.	
2	I wrote down that was literally the best thing I've ever seen it was comical and I loved it anyway, so all those are Oliver wants handed a kisses hand, but the dog has his it and so that they just had the dog just for that.	
1	But whose dog is it? Why do they give it a name? It's just like a plot device.	
2	It's lazy writing. Honestly, like very lazy writing. That's this whole show has lazy writing and I'll definitely have a couple more notes about At but I just was like dog and and while they were in the car, all of the lines were total plot narration, like explaining and feeding the audience stuff that we didn't already know which I guess is like Fair because it's only the second episode by you just referring to the fact that like Oliver had a crush on her.	
3	I don't know exactly what they were talking about.	
2	They were just like kind of narrating the plot and it was kind of annoying.	
3	Yeah. I mean, I guess that's okay for a pilot. This is the second episode.	
2	I just like the fashion show not tell kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. The kid shows was not going to I can expect like too much but also at the same time, I feel like this is definitely one of those shows were I in theory. I'm like, okay all the shows from when we were kids are definitely better than the ones from now, but this one is not I hate to say it but a lot of the lady that lazy writing kind of got yeah.	
3	I don't know. I just got caught up in it while you're watching it. And now that you're saying I kind of do understand the show don't tell thing because it's kind of like if we like we're filming us walking to class more like G Kate. Unlike I love walking to class like that sounds like cheesy.	
2	So as yeah kind of what you're saying like it's like it's like vlogging.	
3	Yeah, you know Danny Gonzalez has that video about Tessa Brooks where he talks about her once he call it boring Vlogs are boring Vlogs because she's just like, all right, and we're going to go to the beach and then the next clip is like debit Emil and she's like and we went to the beach and we had fun. It's like, okay.	
2	Well, that's not interesting to watch because telling me anyways, that's a tangent that we don't really need to go off on because it was just like that one scene where I was like upset that they	
3	Like spoon-feeding the audience these facts because especially because we already knew that Oliver liked Hannah because of the first episode. Because they were trying to break into the first episode.	
2	We are trying to break into Hanna's dressing room and she throws her towel to him and then heat up the next day like at the next day the next day at school.	
3	He's like I have him ideas. All right. Yeah. You're right. You're right, right. So I don't know. Um, one thing I want to point out is that when I was in Middle School the most embarrassed. So everyone has like, you know fashion thing they did in middle school as embarrassing. Mine was putting a belt over my clothes and I always and I always thought Not that this came from Alex from Wizards of Waverly Place. I thought that that was where I got this fashion, but I saw as soon as the opening scene came out and she's on stage wearing a belt over her clothes. I was like it started with her.	
2	Okay, but why was the best place was right under her boobs or was that a way?	
1	So there's that picture you were you felt like yeah. I used to put in like middle. You're not around my boobs directly under like a support system. Are you I just wanted to talk about that.	
3	I'd like to officially blame Miley Cyrus in her costume designers.	
2	I did actually write that the the outfits were iconic in the set. Have you seen that post? That's like I just saw the set from Hannah Montana and I can't believe it's not real and every time I see that I'm like wow because that for especially like Rico's. Yeah, which he wasn't even in this episode at always disappointing.	
1	Yeah. That's that is so cheesy, but I kind of love it is nice charm to it.	
3	Yeah their house looks great with your Decor though. I have some comment. Well, we can talk about the house there in the house more in the next episode so we can talk about that in a little bit.	
2	But okay, so let's get into the plot of this episode a little bit because we've really we anyways so basically the plot this episode is that Oliver is in love with Hannah, but the like the secondary plot for him is that he's terrified of gum because his grandmother like spitting come on.	
1	I just want to point out this scene where they like showed her spitting gum like like it was supposed to be an Simple like she looked like she was just spitting it out like it was so it was like tensional and cheesy and I think the funniest part is I was gonna make a comment about how that was also like lazy writing that they did show the flashback but it's so quick and it's just it makes no sense.	
2	Like he's a baby. How does he even remember that? But it's just he's still in his crib when we showed it was too funny in common goal like that that flashback for me to even comment on it and then when they zoomed back out Out of the flashback like That's So Raven style. His face was so funny. Yeah, and I was just like, yeah, I can't write anything down about this because it's just too funny.	
1	Yeah kudos to Mitchel Musso so you can have a bad writing and you know, it's so funny it but it's the acting that saved it. I think yeah the actors in the show our good good and bad how I have it depends on how you're talking about because I think Mitchel Musso is really good in this episode.	
2	However, Miley's acting sucks in the entire first season. It's so cheesy and uncomfortable, and I'm not If it's just because of the writing but it none of it seems like genuine. Yeah, I agree Lily is also sometimes a little but also like I wrote in my next note is like I can't believe how young they are like, they're supposed to be you said just before high school.	
3	Yeah. I think I think in the next season they get into high school. So they're either an eighth grade. They might even being seventh but then again there is Young and I guess that accounts for the fact that they seem a little less mature when they're reading the lines, but also the lives that they're given are clear. Lee written by adults for kids and they're not they just don't seem like things kids would say, I don't know. Yeah because like you look at a show like Andy Mac or something like it's very we're going to always be comparing. Yeah, but just like the you can tell like they actually like talk to children and like you understand kids at that time. So yeah, I agree with you.	
2	I don't just doesn't seem like even it rang very true for me and the end of the episode. When Miley was trying to convince all of her that she that he should be in love with Mandy Moore instead of handing, Montana Montana. Yeah, and I was like, I barely knew who and Mandy Moore. I only know who may be more is because she was entangled.	
3	Okay. I see I knew her before that but like still like the thing that I knew her from was like A Walk to Remember which is Nicholas Sparks movie that I probably should have known at the time. So yeah, I agree with you on that. I don't think that she was the person to compare people to okay my neck.	
2	Yeah, my next note about actually have a legit note about the writing. Is that Robby Ray calls Jackson's son.	
3	And I'm sorry. I that's underwriting thing that I can't stand is when characters say like sister or brother to their just call them. No one realizes his sister brother. You're not going to you're like you're not you wouldn't enter a room and go.	
2	Hey big sis. Like that's yeah and you wouldn't say son. You would say their name.	
3	Well, it was just I'm going to counter that with he supposed to become. Tree and so that's supposed to be kind of like that's true vernacular. Like he wouldn't call my league daughter but like saying son is a little more I guess normal. It's good point. I'm okay with that. The line cut-offs were funny. I don't know if you noticed that too. There were a couple times like Oliver would start to like say that like he started to say a poem at one point and then they like cut him off and like he was like, oh, let's think of what's a rhyme for something and maybe white.	
1	Yeah, and I was got if they had like three	
3	Different lines like that though. We're like someone they cut them off before. They said something. I wish that I had written down examples, but I just thought it was funny.	
1	Okay.	
2	So let's talk about the secondary this legitimate and secondary part of this episode, which is the whole Jackson and his girl car quote-unquote girl car thing. Yeah. I hated that. Yeah. I'm not sure if I was the only one and it's funny because I haven't watched these episodes in a long time because when I do re-watch Hannah Montana It's usually the later Seasons. I felt like they I don't know. I just there's a lot of stuff that happened in Even this episode not only this episode but also the episode that we all the second episode we watched the didn't seem like it's a good well. Yeah it really didn't. Yeah.	
1	No, I'd like our thing. I really like and and spoiler alert.	
3	The whole plot of the girl car is like Jackson buys a car and then like he leaves and tries to like turn it in because I'm his friend makes fun of him for having a girl car and then Robbie tries to turn it in because the neighbor makes fun of it and then Robbie comes back because the They wouldn't take the car back. So he like made the music louder.	
1	No, my car is the car bounces. Yeah, like like straight out of style.	
2	No, it's just for stationary doesn't do that when I don't know.	
1	I mean it can but I just thought it was stupid also the car I'm sorry.	
3	Like the car was nice if yeah, it's like a dream car.	
1	It's a convertible. Well that and like there's no way Jackson could afford a car like that.	
2	Like I was thinking that even like they tried to explain it by like this happened in the car and this cat gave Borg in the front seat. A brand new car it was ridiculous. And yeah, I just talked we did you mention the neighbor Donzi.	
1	Let's talk because I do believe they and I remember more fat jokes about him again didn't age.	
3	Well like not cool.	
2	Honestly, the thing that saves Us episode was just all over in general. His character was great. I like I love the whole Oliver's like Locker man thing is adorable. Yeah and iconic and I think I found his Hannah Montana dedication kind of	
3	earring. Really? Yeah.	
2	Oh and they also forced out or foreshadowed all over in Lily's relationship, which I'm sure they did not even know it was going to no, I don't think so because I'm sure that writing didn't happen for many years down the road that was really funny especially from a perspective of right now. Yeah knowing that eventually they would write them in as a couple and several seasons down the road. So that was kind of I like that.	
3	I also wanted to point out. When did I? You know, this is this is part of the actual plot of the show. But like all of our at one point is like two feet from three people that he's close with Robbie Miley and Lily and he doesn't recognize any of them like something died down but like he knows their voices. You don't probably looks the same and I'm going to say this about the other ones who like, I don't know like he is Robby Ray and he always talks about Hannah Montana being his daughter.	
1	Yeah, so I don't know how that passes like, all he does is put on a mustache and he's been seeing this for	
3	Years, like - teacher is going to look at and be like, oh my gosh, you're right.	
2	But the other thing is that like Oliver and Miley are like in the end and the end of episode like talking about how close they were like out like stuff.	
3	They like stuff that they did when they were kids like such clearly. They've been best friends for like a long time.	
2	There's a lot going to people's birthday parties and I just was like, I can't like if I heard your voice from behind a door, I would know it was you. Yeah regardless of where I was. Yeah, so I just don't I don't I don't understand I get that. It's a kid show. And like at the time I didn't think much of it but it's just come on. Yeah, I mean I understand for her classmates as a little different but again, like you said something supposed to be that way. Yeah. Oh, I know this is stupid, but I noticed when Donzi left and they were still like out in the parking lot area. They have Fountain that's just full of flowers. No water so funny.	
1	I thought that was so funny. I wrote it down. I wrote what	
3	Although I can't let's talk.	
2	Okay, let's talk about the gum chewing yeah disgusting the whole scene with Hannah and Oliver was so awkward bothering me.	
1	I just it was so uncomfortable.	
2	I can't even imagine how all over must have felt. I know because you're being so weird scene.	
3	I you know, that's a very common plot of a kids show like you look at I don't know if you remember this, I'm gonna pull out Nickelodeon. Sorry that this is a Disney podcast, but there's no sort of Drake & Josh where they do the same thing like Drake doesn't like a girl. More so he pretends to like be really disgusting to like get her to not like him. So I guess I think I'm used to heat like a spaghetti dinner. It's like I don't know but I feel like I'm very used to like that plot device which like again. It hadn't no it's not my favorite. But like it didn't bother me, I guess.	
2	Yeah. It was just kind of I think the lines were just kind of strange for me. Yeah. I don't know. I also was just like while I was watching that scene. It just became oh when Oliver walked. Down after Lily called him to tell him that Hannah was there and he tapped that guy on the shoulder and then the guy turned around was like what did he say? It was? I don't even remember he was like, please leave. Yeah, something like that. It was really funny anyways, but I was just like looking at the setting and just wondering where the heck was that supposed to be my because I know I know but it's like the it was the beach.	
3	Yeah, but there were tons of like plants everywhere.	
2	That's not what a beach looks like where they I wasn't paying that much.	
3	So were they in the ground?	
2	I it was weird and there was like a rock. I don't know. It was just a strange setting another thing.	
3	I want to talk about. I'm going back to costumes again all of our had this double pole.	
1	Oh, oh that was still going on. It was so funny though. He was just wearing a polo on top of another. It's like double Kali like there's soap. I can picture it in my head right now.	
2	What else do I have to say?	
3	Oh one more thing. I want to talk about just that Robby. Ray was not helpful at all. Nibbling either situation. First of all, he like totally gave into like Jackson by a girl car and like was like embarrassed about it. That's not good.	
2	Parenting know there's a forgot I was supposed to be their only parent.	
3	Yeah, and then with Miley he was like, oh I think Oliver needs a new girlfriend. Like that's not there also like 14.	
1	Yeah. I just don't think that was the best.	
3	I think he should have just been like fine. You can tell him like, I don't know.	
2	I just I have a note about not in this episode. And the next episode that they make especially Robby Ray looks so stupid.	
3	They make all the adults look ridiculous. Like like like yeah. Okay, they make him look really stupid.	
2	Like because I don't know.	
3	I think that's just a thing in kid shows. These adults are kind of stupid.	
2	Especially Wizards.	
3	That's like they do that a lot. Yeah, you guys think about like the dads are always really cheap the moms are like always wanting to be the star of the show. That's true.	
2	Like that's it's just as Liv and Maddie to the And the pants Liv and Maddie is such a big really the big offender of that.	
3	But at least like Amy and Bob have like good moments on Good Luck Charlie. I feel like Karen and is it also Bob?	
2	That's the dad on it's definitely Karen. Yeah. Remember the dad's name. But anyways, the parents on Liv and Maddie are just like ridiculous like over-the-top.	
3	They are the top and it's just it's the point where I was always like, okay, like that's enough.	
2	Yeah, so I don't know so I definitely see that with this show, but I have to say like this isn't the worst on that. No, no and same with wizards. But okay.	
3	I'm ready to move on to the next one anything else to say.	
2	My only other note is that I've never ever seen licorice gum in my life.	
1	I thought about that too as soon as as soon as she pulled out the gum.	
3	I was like isn't it Licorice and then she pulls out licorice gum. Oh and I took a note. It was like Greg on that. She put it in her mouth and then immediately like she was chewing tar.	
1	It looks That's what it looked. Like. That's what I wrote down. Okay, let's move on. Okay.	
2	So the second episode we're talking about is called I will always love you and I pointed out to Bridget before we started watching at this is a pun on the song. I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton who's in episode which of course I didn't know at the time but it's actually kind of I thought that was fun.	
3	Yeah, especially I like that all the titles of the episodes or song titles. I think it's very smart.	
2	This is a good episode for us to watch now because we're doing 9 to 5 the musical at our college. So we're very we feel very Very close to Dolly Parton. Yes present moment.	
1	That's maybe that's why I was totally biased towards doll me to level so she was less annoying. Yeah.	
3	So if you look at the plot of this episode, it's basically like Miley wins an award for an award show and her man law comes to visitor and she finds out that Dolly Miley's Orion. Does it Aunt?	
2	Oh, yeah godmother to they said Aunt Aunt Dolly.	
3	Yeah, but they also said it was their God that's confusing. Yeah, I mean anyways, but um that she was So staying at the house and they had this long going argument going on because Dolly stole Bama so Elvis from them like they both dated like memo how to Summer Elvis Elvis like Elvis Presley. So that was interesting. I remember this being one of my favorite episodes. I find it very stressful.	
2	Yes know I always felt it was very stressful.	
3	Yeah. So let's just get into it. So in this mamuh is played By Vicki Lawrence. And as soon as she came on the screen, there were start searing and so Kailyn are like what and so we looked at that so she's in The Carol Burnett Show. She is Place Carol Burnett know. Okay, so she's just famous from that. No, Carol. Burnett is an actress. Yes and a singer. I guess.	
2	She's just in it. I've never seen The Carol Burnett Show at a time of ever seen. It was on an infomercial that I saw for like 30 minutes while I was getting my nails done.	
1	Yeah, so we have heard of it, but then they put that is like I feel like that I feel like	
2	Cheering was definitely for the adults in the room. Like if my mom was watching it with me as a kid. She might get that and again, I didn't know who Dolly Parton was either.	
3	Oh, I see a kid, but I didn't know who Dolly Parton was but I will say like they that's probably a button to you know, like they don't film he's in front of a live studio not they added that in so they must know I don't know. Anyways, let's move on from that because that's Oh, I thought it was strange that they both wanted to stay at their house specifically Dolly because if I was in my	
2	Miami I would want a hotel and also the beginning of the episode starts out with my Lee Jackson fighting over which rum mammals going to stay in either Miley's rumor Jackson's room, which if you know Hannah Montana at all, you know, there's an entire episode dedicated to how disgusting and unlivable the conditions in Jackson's remark and yet they still make mamaw like stand there and watch it there, but just because I'm pretty sure that that episode doesn't happen until am not a hundred percent sure, but I'm pretty sure that episodes For this one, so I didn't get that. I got really confused.	
3	They could have literally had someone stay in my lady's closet and would have been fine.	
2	That's so sweet pause it. That's so sad. Anyways, so I wrote Dolly's legit the most iconic woman. Yeah. Thank you so much. One thing I did notice that they actually I thought was decent writing is that the way that Mama and Robbie race speak is similar, which is makes sense because they're supposed to be mother and son. Okay, especially also because they're from the same place. I thought it was I said great writing, but I think that's okay writing. Ting oh, I know you're going to I'm sure you were to note about this but I didn't notice it in the first episode that I did notice it like poignantly and this episode the in-between see music.	
1	Whoa. The first one was the funniest.	
2	But yeah, those kill me every time I watched a thread ones of just just those and it was oh my God, I honestly that's one of the funniest and most iconic things about Hannah Montana's in between music because that makes a lot about that.	
1	Yeah.	
2	Yeah, well yeah they put they put in weird ones at certain times because I think it's weird place not it's not that it's like I don't know I think it's just the way it sounds like it's just weird vocalizing like I think that iCarly has in between music too and I could be wrong not to bring up a Nickelodeon show on a Disney related podcast again, but I think that they also have him to music the Miranda Cosgrove and singing It's just instrumental but I think that's why I don't like this one and it's weird because again, she's just like whoa whoa, whoa	
1	I don't think it's the vocals that bothered me.	
3	It's like they they made weird placement for it. Like they got in like a minor fight and it played like really sad.	
1	I'm talking you think it was just a lot of like, I don't know.	
3	I mean a certain way to felt like, okay and then but the first one that they played was just like we were just like, oh my gosh, we just both lists each other and burst out laughing.	
1	Okay.	
2	So one of the things that that I brought it at the point that I brought up before about how there was rioting in this new episode. The didn't really age well and like wasn't appropriate for children is that they continually use the word trans?	
1	Yeah.	
2	I brought that to which bothered me so much not like if this was like an adult's TV show I've that would have that would have slid so like I wouldn't have cared. Yeah. However, this is a kids TV show and also I just like Dolly Parton and I didn't enjoy that. She was referring to the hardest drink.	
3	Yeah that know I thought that was way too risque.	
2	I did not appreciate that and then the fact that the first time I was like, okay like whatever and then they said it a second time and I was like Okay, like you kind of hit home the second time especially for me. Yeah didn't really like that. But then immediately after that there's secondary plot with Rico and Oliver which makes it so much better the okay.	
1	I have to say I don't love this episode but the secondary pot with recode Oliver was really funny and the acting was also really funny. Yeah. Thanks.	
3	Rico being more annoying than he was in this think. He's more annoying with Jackson that does make sense because he had Oliver like friendly Yeah.	
2	So basically the secondary plot and the up	
1	Is that Oliver is trying to help Rico film a public access commercial for Rico's and it's so funny because they have the exact same hair haircut isn't not be worst of objects and Rico and Oliver all a nursery ever so brother Rico's brother the exact same. Yeah, it was terrible like the okay.	
2	So I didn't notice that they were the same haircut until they sat down at the table and that I need to go right away. Oliver sitting next to each other and I was like, they must have the same hair.	
1	It was exactly the color. That's the hard. Yeah, it looks awful. It was terrible.	
3	I didn't notice that Robbie had decent hair considering it was long and he was a father true. I thought it was okay.	
2	I don't know it was like I hated it when I was little the funny part of this part is if you watch the episode you'll know what I mean. But basically when Oliver starts to film Rico his face goes from like a big smile and it just dropped and it's so it's just the Comedy of it and I just it was it was good. Yeah, I don't know. I don't Moises Arias. That's the kid who plays Rico. It was just funny good acting on his part kudos to him.	
1	Yeah, honestly because he saved episode of my opinion moving on from that.	
2	I did I wrote wrote Oh My the Hat I wrote I wrote big hat. So we're talking about here is when violation and Lily the stuff that she bought at the mall with Mamaw and with Dolly so it with Dolly she bought this kind of like Teal Aqua Marine like sequined little mini dress and then ma'am. I want her this big like over the top hat that if you clap twice the lights come on and it's just so funny.	
1	It was okay.	
2	The thing with the hat is that it The Hat itself was funny, but then when Miley said I have an idea and the lights went on. I did not think that was funny.	
1	I thought I was okay.	
3	I don't I did writing but it's it was just not I'm sorry the I thought the role play between Dolly and mamaw was kind of funny so Miley. Only dressed up Lily was Maman Miley was dilated that really so I see how they like acted. Well what I liked about it was Jackson. I thought he was funny. It was funny when he played Elvis.	
2	It was funny but unnecessary the thing about yeah, I okay. So the thing about this is that I thought that the idea of it was funny and that the outfits that they put on the spot on and like, I don't know I thought that was well done. However, I wrote that I don't understand like from their point of view how that was supposed to solve anything.	
3	So basically, I just don't I feel like dressing up in them as As them didn't really solve anything overall, especially because all that the I'm going to go off on a tangent they were so obnoxious.	
2	They were the fighting was obnoxious and it they're supposed to be the adults which is why I brought up the whole before they make the adults look stupid a real adult, especially someone who claims to care about their granddaughter and their goddaughter that much would never ruin an awards night evening so they could fight about stupid shit.	
3	Yeah, like I just to the point where I was like, I don't understand why yeah these characters.	
2	And that's why the episode makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't know about you.	
3	I agree and then at the end of the episode after they like have like literally brawl. They're literally having a broad.	
1	They want Dolly full it mama like onto her head when they were like, they were whipping the body around I was thinking to myself that must have been fun to film like whipping dummies around like they don't like what they did and it was very obvious, but I thought that would have been fun.	
2	But it but they they blink body-slammed were Like body-checked Robbie Ryan to the staged. Yeah, that was kind of funny that was funny. But it was just over the top and I just felt so uncomfortable and Miley when she was giving the speech and she was like cut it out.	
1	Yeah. Yeah around that was just so uncomfortable. Yeah.	
3	Well what I didn't like is at the end Miley's like I'm you know, I'm still mad at you but like I'm not going to like say I hate you forever and then they were like, you know what problem solved let's be nice to each other like um, no, that's not how problems work and Um, if you actually if that milk because if that was like if they had the mindset of like I want to be nice for Miley sake that wouldn't have happened in the first place. They were you don't all of a sudden get that mindset after you've done something bad. They did not care about her like they acted like they really cared about her that night, but they didn't if they didn't really care about her at all because they couldn't put aside their differences for like 10 minutes.	
1	Yeah just didn't even have to stand next to each other. I'm not really sure why they did.	
3	Yeah. Yeah.	
2	Um, that's why I just was uncomfortable with the plot of this episode because it was just those moments.	
3	Mostly mamo mamo to like Dolly very back at her butt like it was it but after only after she made like three comments in a row like correct.	
2	She was kind of it was just I just didn't although I did the thing about this plot that I did like was when they cut to Jackson and Lily on the couch back at the house. That was kind of yeah, I like that and she really was like, why'd you put on wrestling and he was like, this is the award show. That was funny.	
3	Yeah. I'm kind of disappointed that Jackson wasn't a bigger part in either of these episodes I would Maybe we can do a review on kicking it at some point. Oh, yeah, she talked about him and that show but yeah, I would. I just want to be able to like review his character and specifically in a more but I felt like I couldn't because he wasn't like really the biggest character in either these episodes. Yep. And then I just wanted to comment at the end. They did like a quad what quartet? Yeah, that's the fourth of singing and that was really good.	
2	It was good. It's just true friend. That's one of my favorite songs. Yeah, because I had that album when I was a kid. Yeah.	
3	Okay. So the one thing that redeem this episode for me was in fact the ending, however We already discussed how the ending was kind of a little much because they were like, oh like we should have forgiven each other before me like blah blah blah and that was just in genuine. However, the message kind of was genuine to me.	
2	Like I thought there was a really good message about forgiveness and the importance of family and sticking together, which is something really good for kids. However, I just wish that it was done better. It was done in a way where it didn't seem in genuine. Like it didn't come across as we're only doing this because we have to do you know that yeah, so I'm not I didn't love that episode. I didn't love either episode episodes. I don't know.	
3	I just this show I remember being really great and I remember watching it was all like Sunday night like 7:30 or whatever.	
2	I remember really enjoying it and like my babysitter watched it when she was over at her house, but I just I don't know it's not as funny as I remember. Yeah, especially because my like my favorite Disney Channel show of all time is Wizards. Yeah, and that show was just like hilari way up there silly re-plot like Everything was new and interesting good. Yeah, Alton is good. And the characters are lovable and not obnoxious most of them.	
3	Yeah. I mean you look at by the time I was in Middle School. I got to a point where I was like, oh like this shows annoying like shake it up as annoying ant farms enjoying the actress has really shaken up and former both terrible shows, which will probably get interviews about those but like I'm just I'm straight talking about like the main characters that actresses like I would always be like, oh like they're so annoying. I never thought Miley Cyrus was annoying and like watching this I was Like I understand like what she is someone. Yeah, which I think is also just like part of being able to like look at something when you're older and being because wouldn't even say our ages. We're like both 20 now. So when this show came out was show came out in 2005. Yeah, or yeah, it was definite. I was we were young	
2	I don't so I it makes sense to me the like of course. I don't find it as funny now but 2006 that's the first episode that makes sense.	
3	But I don't know. I just I think it's it was just one of those things where I like that I'm able to look back on it and say, okay.	
2	Well maybe not all of the shows were good when we were kids because my mom even says that to me and I say like old Disney was better and she's like, okay. Well, I used to watch some of those shows with you and they were not that good and my mom likes any max you seen a few episodes of me, so, I don't know.	
3	Just I think it really depends. Yeah, it really does.	
2	No, this is just not I like Hannah Montana. I enjoyed watching it. I don't think that it's one of the better Disney shows from when we were a kid.	
3	I don't think I'd enjoy watching it. I didn't watch it when I was little like I enjoy it for the memory is not for the content.	
2	I would say I'm just curious because we definitely are bringing to talk about some other shows that people would say our garbage. Like I really think that we should do an episode on buzard Favre because that was so hated and also because I don't really like Jake Paul another Like to see him and the acting setting yeah, really really skimmed those episodes and we get to see what's Olivia Robidoux. Yeah, and it's like that's not High School Musical musical the series.	
3	So I'm just I'm curious to see like comparing that show and ant farm and Shake It Up to Hannah Montana, which is something that people really Revere as a great Disney Channel show from when we were kids.	
2	I just want to see if we have to say similar things about them because I kind of feel like we might yeah.	
3	Um, but yeah, that's it for this episode. If you do like think of any requests, you can feel free to like comment reach out to us at hello Morning America. Is that a title?
