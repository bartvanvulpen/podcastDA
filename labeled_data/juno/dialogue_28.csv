My dad went to school in France and my mom. Went to school in California from Guam. You're listening to the Daily brew from the Stanford daily. This is Chloe brow idly res Bonnie in this episode.

Turn right on campus Robin.	
3	You will reach Bechtel International Center and I'm from Calgary Alberta Canada the beautiful country by the side of the aisle also known as Egypt from Germany Massey Ghana, although I was born in India. I am from Ghana from Vancouver. I don't know where I'm from.	
1	I lived in New Jersey for 10 years. And then for the past eight years. I've been in Shanghai. I'm fine.	
3	Recife Brazil two and a half hours by plane probably about 18 to 19 hours 13 hours from across to New York and then like five hours from New York to SF every single time. I go through airport security. I'm always picked for a random check pat down. So I'd like that those are things which I've just gotten used to 24 hours total probably around 15 to 16 hours 19 hours. And that's the fastest if I go for the cheapest option late takes me about 37 hours hours. I was excited scared wondering yeah, it was surreal Nostalgia to an extent.	
1	It's very rare that I'm homesick.	
3	So don't just like kind of confused because I'm like what sequence of events like led me here. Sometimes I get into like really really rambling Like Trains of thought where I'm like, oh, you know, like what am I even doing at Stanford? Like I'm making the most of my time here like, oh like am I doing the things that I should be or whatever this is my reality now, it's almost as if I'm commuting back and forth between home and school. The definition of home itself has been like split now even between like the university which is like where I live most of the time but it's like not necessarily really home and like back home, which is like my parents are there but then all the friends are gone. So it's like not like it just doesn't feel right either but Ike gets into Spring quarter. Yeah, like yes, I believe yeah, but like now it's like it's fine, but I will get 26	
1	For international students arriving at Stanford marks the end of a long journey, but it also signifies the beginning of a new culturally immersive experience whether it be differences in with side of the road people drive on or how people greet each other International students across campus experience Stanford through a unique lens.	
3	It's hard to even like Define an American culture.	
1	This is so hit and he is a freshman from Singapore. But when asked about where he considers home he says,	
3	I mean homes also hard to Define for me. I was born in the UK. My parents are Indian within those in Singapore. So then coming here at least the UK in Singapore somewhat similar, but coming here everything.	
1	So for me, like what does he mean by everything is different.	
3	He said with the plugs and like the waters their fur and the water is just the waters harder here. He also compared Singapore to sunny California Honestly, though weirdest and spent the whether it's just cold.	
1	Old you're not wait, the weather is cold. When I think of California the description cold usually doesn't come to mind. But when I check my weather app, I realize so hit is right right now. It is 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Singapore 32 degrees Celsius for my fellow Internationals and the weather right now in Palo Alto. It's 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 21 degrees Celsius. I could see how so hit could feel a bit chilly.	
3	Never going to hold out for like the last 10 years go out without a sweater like three hours later.	
1	And then it's freezing another experience faced by International students are differences in drinking cultures with stricter drinking laws than many other nations drinking culture can appear intense care because in Singapore alcoholism like a taboo, you just drank.	
3	Yeah, we're going to see people being transported.	
1	All right, but differences in social culture extend beyond drinking it can even be seen in everyday conversations.	
3	And people are much more verbal here. They speak their opinion much louder than like Asian countries. We speak to each other but like it wasn't people weren't as direct people were much more polite software for flights also the word it was just like a very respectful even within the storm. Everyone's American visibly people are so different. It's not like in Singapore you have Going for it and they were very similar to each other. So in the smallest things are really weird. So it's just like everything's different.	
1	I don't have the luxury of going back home and you know relaxing for three months and applying, you know from there for jobs. I can't I need to stay in the US and I need to figure all of that while writing my thesis here while doing my course load here while trying to take advantage of all the things that I haven't done so far. I still haven't been to a game senior year comes around and suddenly everybody is in a rush to get resumes written research done major requirements met and to live the Life to its fullest once that senior takes an hour of her Sunday morning out to share with us. What being an international student means. My name is machine Barrack nesrin is a senior from Tunisia where specifically from Gaza which is a three six hours away from the capital Tunis and she's studying history sitting the Middle East and North Africa and I like to add North Africa even though it doesn't exist in the future. Nesrin is really passionate about what she does. She was planning to do a fellowship after graduation and then wait a few years before her PhD when I discovered while doing this research that I'm knowledgeable for. I don't know about 80% of the things that I that I was looking for because of my status as International students because they're only open for u.s. Citizens. That's bad enough as it is and then I also discovered the all of the visa restrictions I only have Months here without the two-year extension that comes with a stem major the F1 Visa just allows students to legally stay in the country for 12 months after graduation being able to stay is contingent on finding either work or funding for research. This makes many Internationals feel like they've got a time bomb strapped to their back. It's one reason among the sense that yeah Americans have a you know, they have the priority for the jobs and there are those many jobs in here the humanity so it makes sense on a logical level, but then it also just makes you feel. Oh no one really understands. There's the atmosphere that everything's going to be fine. You're Stanford Graduate. Don't worry as much so which is the word hate I am I don't chill I am I am a worrier I worry about things. Everyone at the Beginning Sounds, you know, you have time to figure out your major know you don't like. Oh it's so, you know, it's fine. You're going to find your way. It's you know, no, not really. Yes. I'm going to find my way. But if I don't play my cards right from the beginning then I'm going to get screwed and I'm not going to be able to achieve my dreams basically. Sounds sounds cheesy, but but it's true. It is hard to to adopt. It is very much hard to adapt. But we're doing it. We spoke with Axl the president of the international undergraduate Community also known as the iuc and Emily the business manager of the eye you see, I you see aims to foster a community for international students and their American friends that celebrates International culture and we do this through food related events and other types of events. And then we also like to help sort of international to navigate this sort of academic life in the u.s. So we've done a couple of speaker series with International You've graduated and gone to study in the u.s. When speaking about fostering culture for international students in American friends. I can't help but wonder what these differences are finding communities sometimes can be difficult. So I think one issue in general is connecting with other International students question. We get a lot especially when we're at a billing to represent our organization is, you know, have you met anyone from this country? I think one thing that that can definitely make people feel a lot more comfortable being in a foreign countries have In that at least one other person who's from the same era there was and maybe they have like a national holiday or something that they can like meet up and celebrate together because it is is different like living the nine months of the year in a different country. So to kind of have that almost home comfort in the form of another person can be really nice. There's a spectrum of how International you can be like the overall defining factor is more like shared experiences of being in a foreign country or like being in a place that's foreign to you. But ultimately, you know, we're not we're not here to Define it. I think it's more about how International person feels and if they feel like they have a link to a specific specific country or culture and I you see at least we're very open to our how that is interpreted. It's different for everybody. It's different for the guy down the hall and different for the grad student that graded your midterm behind every different does it perspective for you to discover? So maybe knock on someone's door today find a friend ask a question. Share your story. This episode was produced by Chloe bro, Lela Rose.
