My name is De courcey Williams and this is the uplifting words podcast and I hope each and every one of you is having an amazing day in amazing December. We're getting really close to the end of the year 2019. In is quickly coming upon us. So the question is have you started on your new goals for the new year yet? Any New Year's resolutions that you have in mind that you want to get taken care of and I'm not talking about stuff that's going to be fresh in your mind, January and February and forgotten by like March. I'm talking about some real deal written down goals something that you have in your mind. That's got to be done. It's 2019. It's another year. If you are sitting on the sidelines of life, it is time to get off of those Sidelines and get involved in the big game. So let me take this opportunity to of course, give a major shout out to our partner organifi and their ever continuing line of products.

So now that that is out of the way I want to talk about something that I have actually been giving into here in recent times. I want to talk about cutting the cord. Let me give you a little quick story though. You ever heard of the term Big Brother. Do you know where that came from? I actually found out that it is part of a covert operation that was controlling everything in a dystopian existence and George Orwell's book 1984. Now even though the book was published back in 1949. It was a depiction of how we are living today and it's shockingly accurate. How is that possible you might ask? Well consider this in the book? We have a super State called Oceana. Oceana is ruled by the party and they employ thought police to persecute individualism and independent thinking. Okay. The party is led by Big Brother who has this massive cult following but people can't even confirm whether he actually exists. The world population has become Mm of Perpetual war and omnipresent government surveillance and intense propaganda. If you haven't read this yet. I would highly suggest reading it. It's very good read it may chill you though to be able to draw the parallels to that story written in 1949 again and how we're living today in 2018. So when you hear the phrase big brother is always watching think of the ways that you could be potentially tract. Think about how you see in movies where they're solving a crime or in a TV show and they pull up cameras at stop lights or they pull up cameras at ATMs and pull up cameras in restaurants and they're able to visually watch someone going from point A to point B by bouncing off of different camera signals from different locations. So yeah think about that but we're all being controlled and manipulated in some way a lot of the times we don't even even realize it not only would be watched but we're being controlled big brother has control now, who is Big Brother you asked who could possibly influence hundreds of thousands of people, who is it that could possibly have control over your mind your actions and by default your life. It is sensationalized Media, of course for many many years. There's been a fight going on right out here in plain sight right under all of our nose. The fight for our attention and it has never been more profound or more Cutthroat than what we're dealing with today. Now some time ago there were only a few new stations on TV or even radio. We didn't have internet back when I was coming up. So there was only a few channels now, they're everywhere and they're all vying for your attention now to compete most of them what I like to call dopamine drug-dealing pimps news media has taken to the most underhanded tactic that it could come up with in order to keep you hooked and watching they strike at the very base of human emotions and they threaten our existence. It's the only way to grab our attention now nothing else gets it nothing else gets your attention more readily than threats and danger and fear. Now. What happens is these media Outlets. They scour the world in search of probably about a dozen or so of the most wretched stories that they can find. Then these news media Outlets use them to monetize your attention. Which of course is great for them, but it's horrible for you. Now, let me tell you why before I do that though.	
1	However, let me give you a quick word. You take a quick break. Hey, everyone de courcey Williams here. And I wanted to take a quick moment to tell you guys about anchor if you haven't heard about anchor yet. Now is the time for you to jump in Anchor is the easiest way to make a podcast. It's free. They're special creation tools that allow you to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or computer anchor will distribute your podcast for you. So it can be heard on Spotify apple and many many more you can make money from your pocket. Cast with no minimum listenership. Anchor is everything you need to make a podcast all in one place. So go download the anchor app or go to Anchored on FM to get started. That's a n CH o r dot f m-- to get started. So let me tell you why but in order to put to it properly explain why this is really bad for you. Let me give you a little bit of an explanation on how the creative process works for most people. Now we get in our lives what we create. That's an easy concept, right? But what drives that creative process? Expectations what we expect to happen is our creative process that goes to work. This is why the statement holds true that our expectations lead to manifestation. So what do we expect our thoughts our thoughts are what drives our expectations? So here's the big question. What is controlling our thoughts whatever it is that is right in front of your face. What we see what we hear the input that we choose to put in front of us is what drives our thoughts. So what we are thinking about all the time is what is informing our expectations which in turn drives our creative process which ultimately manifest in our lives just like you've heard garbage in garbage out. No, no. No, that's not quite true garbage in garbage stays and it stinks the stench from that garbage is what others around you have to deal with. It's the stench from the garbage that comes out of us. But the point is that the constant barrage of sensationalize and negative information is devastating to our own creative personal actions. It's simple whatever controls your attention controls your life or more specifically whatever you give your attention to controls your life. You have to find a way to break free. You have to cut the cord you should be in control of your own attention. If you want to be successful you have to take that control and you can do it, too. I have total faith that each and every person can take and take that control and it's actually very simple the power is literally in the palm of your hand. You can simply turn your TV off turn off. The news feeds alerts to your phone cancel your newspaper subscription. If people are still doing that thing do whatever it is you have to do in order to shut the nonsense out. You can't allow media fear mongers to have access to your precious mind and therefore your thoughts. Here is where your thoughts should be going focus on what you can control and ignore the rest. You can you can't control the national economy. You can however control your own personal finances. You can't control what's going on with our Health Care system in this country and I do mean in the US for anyone that might be listening outside of America, but you can however control your own health and reduce your need to for doctor visits by maintaining a healthy diet. Exercising constant meditation or consistent meditation and prayer so on and so forth. You can't control how the president runs this country whether you love them or you hate them you can however control how you run your life your household your business Etc. You can't control the world swimming with lies and Scandals racism Wars and Corruptions going on everywhere else. You can control love peace character and Harmony in your own home. So stop worrying about what you can't control or it will control you. It's time to take back control of your mind and thoughts so that you can take back control of your own life. Stop allowing other people's influence. Stop allowing other people to influence your attitude your hope for the future and your potential to do something great start focusing on what's right with the world. So think about this remember those dozen or so horrible news stories that the media finds and puts out the whole catastrophic and horrendous stories will compare that to the thousands and thousands of positive stories that Ever see the light of day. There are many tales of people helping out others are putting themselves in dangerous uncomfortable positions in order to help others out or people just doing things just because those stories don't get air time because that's not what sells that's not what's going to help make whatever news media money. And that's not to say that they are evil. They're not evil. That's just their business their business is vying for Your attention, so maybe it's time to step out of the situation room and Wolf's narrow view of things fox and friends are not your friends. They are Your Puppet Masters who Wrangle your attention and sell it to the highest bidder. Now for you, you should focus your attention on ideas information and knowledge that can help you grow and contribute to making a positive difference in our world. And who knows you might just do something to change the world. There's a lot of beautiful beautiful and wondrous amazing things that's going on in this world and those deserve just as much if not more attention than the few new stories that keep coming up. Now, if you've ever noticed news key for cycling the same stories basically all day long, maybe two or three different news stories, but they keep going back to him. Have you ever noticed that I wonder why that is. It's all a grab for your attention. That's what gets people's attention. That's what they make their money off of. So with that being said, I think I'm going to wrap it up here kind of wanted to throw this out there. I was kind of listening because I listen to news stories myself and I kind of see how a certain group of people that watch One News Network. Of course, they think a certain way People that watch the different News Network. They think a certain way so who's controlling the news networks? That's the big question and I don't want to give in to conspiracy theories or somebody having their finger on the button or unseen organization kind of controlling everything. I don't want to get into stuff like that because that's out of my control if they are doing that then that's what they're doing. But I can control what I put in what I take in. So that point the average thought about using like audible. I'm not a person that really can sit there and read books. I've never actually been like that even though I'm pretty well reader, but I find that instead of with my with my phone instead of putting music on I actually put on a book and and my audible account. I've got Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. I've got crushing it by Gary vaynerchuk. I've got Darren Hardy's book. I can't even remember the name of it right now. But I've got to like 10 or 12 like Self Health entrepreneurial motivational books that I listen to and then of course, I've got all the Harry Potter books, but that's neither here nor there. So but I want to emphasize that everyone has the power for independent thinking and I feel like there's the sort of slow wakening of of people a lot of things when I was a kid a lot of things. I just kind of took for granted and everybody around me just kind of took the stories that we were told or the way that things happen. We didn't really question that stuff this generation here is so much information so much knowledge out there people are actually questioning how they're being brought up because people are realizing that just because you were brought up this way or just because there was a group of people that got First or made the first decision that doesn't make them infallible. That doesn't make them perfect. People are more willing to find out things for their own for themselves. The problem with that is a lot of people might get their news information from Facebook or from Twitter instead of actually looking up and verifying a reputable Source now giving a list of reputable sources that can be another 30 40 minutes on this podcast. I would just invite you to do your own research figure out your own information come up with your own ideas. But like I said in a previous podcast don't be so quick to judge others who may think differently than you do. So with that being said, thank you very much for listening.
