This is optimal living daily episode 1296 a primer on fullscreen living by Leo about of Zen habits dotnet and I'm just a molecule very own personal narrator today and every day. So it's not a typical podcast. There are no interviews and it's short almost always fewer than 10 minutes. It'll have some comments of my own on this post. So stick around to the end to hear those for now. Let's get right to the post and start optimizing your life. a primer on fullscreen living by Leo Bovada of Zen habits dotnet The other day while I was visiting a friend she offered her Dog a Bone the dog wanted the bone but didn't want to drop the toy animal in his mouth to get the bone Jack. You can't have both at the same time. My friend said most of us are like Jack we want more than one thing at once. We're not willing to let go of one thing in order to do another we're doing one work tasks while trying to stay on top of email text messages and social media. We're talking with a friend while seeing what We're missing on Facebook and Instagram. We're eating while planning making love while thinking about work like Jack we think we can hold two things in our mouths at once. But actually that's a fantasy. We can't taste the food while thinking about what we need to do later our mouths, maybe moving in the food might be swallowed but there's no awareness of how the food tastes instead. We're switching back and forth between the planning and the tasting like a dog going back and forth between a bone and a toy not content to do just one thing at a Time I'd like to offer as an alternative fullscreen living. What's fullscreen living. It's a life where we allow one thing to take up the entirety of our attention going into a full-screen mode like a video on your computer while allowing everything else to fade into the background. Let's take a look full screen computer work many longtime readers know I prefer full screen distraction free text editors, like right room. Ohm writer or Q10 they fill up your Green, so there are no distractions as you write. It's just a you on your text notifications. No other tabs open. No other programs showing no clock or icons. I'm writing this post in WordPress is full screen editor at the moment as well as using Chrome's presentation mode. So that nothing is showing on the screen, but these words I'm typing not even the menu bar but full screen work on the computer doesn't have to stop there. You can do almost anything in full screen mode. I read articles and blog posts using Instapaper service is strips as and all irrelevant page elements and leaves only the text I watch videos in full screen mode online videos on YouTube or Vimeo or one saved on my computer and iTunes if I'm working in a browser tab, I'll pull that Tab out in a new window so that it hides any other tabs that might be open or I'll close all other tabs save things. I want to read later and instapaper and close them or make note on a to-do list of tasks. I need to do that are represented by open tabs and click. Close the tabs. When you bring whatever task you're working on or video, you're watching or article you're reading into full screen mode everything else Fades into the background. You just have the one task in front of you. The one thing to read or write and you aren't switching back and forth between bone and toy this means you can fully Focus can fully Savor the article can fully give your attention to your work. You do better when there's only one thing in your mouth or in your attention. Fullscreen living that's fine for computer work. But what about life in general? You can live exactly the same way. If you're going to spend time with your child don't switch between the child Tab and the work tabs in the browser of your mind put your child into full screen mode and let him take up all your attention and let work and everything else. You need to do later Fade Into the background. You'll still get to the work when you're done with what you're doing with your child, but for now be fully in this one activity. With this one person when you're done with that, you can bring your work in a full screen mode and let the rest of your life going to the background for the moment. If you eat let the food fill up the screen of your attention not you're thinking about other things. If you're showering let that fill your attention instead of planning when you're brushing your teeth, let the conversation read argument you had earlier fade away and just brush your teeth when you work do one task at a time. It don't just do one task at a time, but do that task. With all your attention or as much as possible and don't be thinking about the other tasks the doing easier said than done, right? How do you let other things go when you were doing one thing? How do you focus on your child or your food instead of your work? It takes practice as with anything when you first start practicing you won't be great at it, but you'll get better with practice start today a great practice is sitting meditation. We do nothing but sit and maybe just pay attention to your breath that's difficult as our minds tend to throw thought after thought at us, but noticing those thoughts can be a useful practice that is carried into all other activities in our lives beyond sitting try mindful cleaning what you learn in sitting and cleaning will be applicable in every other full screen activity. You do each day fullscreen living isn't necessarily easier than one where you're constantly switching between the tabs of your mind. It takes constant practice and in fact that practices Waking moment, but if we realize we can't have the bone and the toy in our mouth at the same time. Then we realized that by giving up the toy will enjoy the bone so much more it will be fully tasted instead of stuff into a mouth that can't taste it.

Maybe I was last week about sitting and being in the present moment and what I mentioned at the end of that episode is how I'll let my mind wander During certain activities like showering because sometimes when I do that, I'll come up with great ideas ideas. I wouldn't come up with if I purposely tried to think of a great idea and that's often left out of these mindfulness posts that the goal isn't to be present all the time since I Possible, but he simply giving you ideas of where you can practice being aware present and mindful instead of doing formal sitting meditation practice mindful cleaning mindful showering being completely present in a conversation actually listening. These are all different forms of a meditative practice and will help you become better at seeing when your mind goes off the rails and lets the negative or unproductive thoughts Cloud your mind. So all of these activities including eating their simply different ways to practice station, but that's just my take on it. I'll do it for today.
