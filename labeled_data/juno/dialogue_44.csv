2	You can find me primarily on Facebook Instagram Snapchat YouTube LinkedIn, and of course on Twitter and Tick-Tock if I didn't say it my username and all these platforms is identical. It is at polyglot Azran that is spelled Pol y GL o-- t a	
4	That or Z depending on your country re n you can also simply search as learn the language nerd on whatever your favorite social network is again that is spelled a z or Z re n the language nerd and welcome to another podcast episode. I am very very excited as per usual to be recording this one here. There's a lot of different things. I want to touch on in this podcast. So let's Dive Right In the first thing has to do with the blog post that I wrote yesterday and it's more of a general life observation something that I believe in tremendously. So I have a very busy life. I have a lot of things that are going on. So yesterday for example my day started at about 9:30 10:00 a.m. And I was back I was booked back-to-back with meetings teaching prepping for classes.	
3	Like I was just booked back-to-back to back to back to back all the way till about 11:30 p.m. Because an extremely long day and those kinds of long days are not uncommon for me.	
2	I often most of the time actually at least on let's say Monday through Thursday.	
4	I start my days at 10 o'clock in the morning and they finish at about 9:30 or 10:00 p.m.	
3	So the long days Fridays are pretty long to Fridays are like a 10 to 6 kind of day. Saturday's are at least minimally 12 to 6 often a little bit longer.	
4	There's a lot of stuff I have going on on top of that. I have a good level of balance like I spend time with my family. I watch TV I sleep 78 hours. Like I have a lot of stuff that I try and fit in my day both personal and work which therefore means I'm usually fouled Back 2 back for most minutes of a date and because of that, you know, whenever people see my schedule of the here of this the stop the other thing often one of the questions people ask me is asthma and where does your energy come from?	
2	How do you have so much energy and I want to talk a little bit about Doc's I think there's some learning points that can probably benefit some of the people who are listening to this podcast for me personally. I think the energy comes from number one. I enjoy I enjoy what I'm doing when you're doing something you like. It's easy. You had a lot.	
3	You should see me on Sundays right on Sundays growing up for my during my lifetime.	
2	We used to have cleaning day. In fact, we still have cleaning day. We clean the house every second Sunday.	
3	I hate cleaning is one of my least favorite things to do and cleaning day. I am exhausted all day.	
4	I my head starts to hurt. I don't feel good.	
2	I'm I'm like sluggish.	
4	I don't want to clean I whine and complain.	
3	I don't like it at all. It's not fun and because of that if I had to be cleaning if I had to be cleaning every single day, for example, I'd be tired most of the time I would not be able to consistently keep up the kinds of hours.	
4	I typically keep up in the business the busy and the busyness that I keep up during my day to day life. So I think one of the factors is that I like it and one of the things that I try to encourage people to do, you know as much as possible. Everyone's got through a different. Life's our life circumstances, but as much as possible. I think it's important to try and maximize the time you're putting into things that you enjoy doing. Whether it's a hobby whether it's a sport whether it is your work, maybe it's languages. Maybe it's whatever it is. Maybe you enjoy watching some TV like try to maximize those things that really bring you happiness be mindful.	
2	I'm going to go on a tangent be mindful that you're not shooting yourself in the foot for the long term.	
3	Meaning there are certain things that bring short-term happiness, but	
2	initely bring long-term unhappiness a great example would be like getting super drunk might make you happy for an hour but makes you unhappy and like hungover and your head hurts and it's it's not a good experience for four hours or the whole next day. So be mindful of the short term happiness decisions are making I think that's important, you know, and then we can go an extreme examples like drugs for example might make you feel good, you know for an hour or two or however long drugs make you feel good for I don't do drugs I would No, but obviously in the long-term, it's probably not a good thing for you.	
3	So be be smart about what you're doing. But as a general whole if they're wholesome healthy, okay things to be doing.	
2	Yeah, try and maximize your time and maximize the time you're spending towards things that actually bring you happiness.	
4	I think it's important for me as well.	
3	One of the things that I've realized about myself is that at this stage in my life.	
2	I one of the things that make me that makes me happiest is	
3	being productive and making progress.	
2	I've mentioned this on the podcast before progress and productivity are one of the are two of the core things that make me happiest in life. And so I enjoy keeping myself busy because that genuinely makes me happy. So I think for me a big thing is trying to be as self-aware as possible to figure out what are your core pillars that genuinely make you happiest like what kinds of things are they is it singing is it being productive.	
4	Is it learning something new?	
3	Is it swimming? Is it going for a walk is it and trying to figure out how you can take those core pillars right and and try to implement them as much as you can anyway in your life, it can't be a perfect scenario and then of course number three and this is a really big one for me.	
2	I'm I think I'm lucky and I recognize how lucky I am. I come in. I was born to a good family.	
4	I have a guy had a good upbringing my mom and my sister are around. They haven't died because many people I was watching on Netflix. Actually there is Documentary right now about Kevin Hart many of you probably know who he is. He's a very famous individual and he's got a documentary on on on Netflix and they mentioned how he lost his his mother in 2007 when you do the math actually, it was curious how old he was in 2007. So I looked up his birthday and how old he was. I did the math. He was like 27 28 years old. That's how old I am right now. I'm 27 and my 27. Yes. I'm 20 and I 27 or 28	
2	27 that's how old I am. That's basically my age right? Like I cannot imagine what that would be like losing losing my mom at 27. Like that's crazy. That's that's so young. So I feel very lucky that I still have her around. I still have my sister right even in that in that documentary. Kevin had a father who was you know doing drugs and when he was growing up and I didn't have that situation right? I'm lucky for that. I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood. I grew up in a good neighborhood. Could I have food in the fridge? I the so many things I'm lucky for that. I just I almost feel it just makes me happy.	
4	So I feel so lucky.	
2	I feel like I have so much it's kind of like if I 27 cakes and 27 takes none of us can eat 27 cakes in one sitting 27 cakes or a million like a hundred cakes is so many cakes, right? And you know, if you lose one cake, it's okay. Like it's this I feel like there's an abundance right now for me anyway, so that's a really big.	
3	After two and then myself the other big thing and this is Morris to a lot of where my energy comes from.	
2	There's so many things I want to accomplish personally personally and professionally that I have not done yet and that drives me because I for me to accomplish things that I want to do personally and professionally.	
4	I want to try and squeeze every single minute. I want to try I want to do that. For example, you know personally one thing I'm not very happy about right now.	
2	It's I would like to be someone who is in Tip-Top physical shape.	
3	I would like to be someone who's super flexible, very strong agile has good endurance.	
2	I want to be someone like that and I feel one thing I'm not happy about right now is I'm not putting in the appropriate efforts to be able to do that. I am kind of active it's a little bit but again, it's not the kinds of steps.	
3	I need to be actually taking so that's a big thing that sits on my mind and that's a personal thing. I need to try and figure out work-wise, you know, I	
4	I need if I want to sustain myself in the long term meaning if I want to like if I want to achieve my financial goals. I need to earn more money. If I want to achieve my professional growth goals in terms of how many people I want to be teaching. I'll need more students right I need is a lot more. I want to accomplish that I have not accomplished yet. Meaning I have to squeeze every minute while still being healthy. And so, you know, at least for me, I mean, I just want to make sure it's on the record like I sleep 7 to 8 hours. Cause I don't do drugs, I don't drink alcohol. I don't even drink coffee.	
2	Like I don't do anything that would enhance my energy, you know, I try and I try my best to keep my system as clean as possible. I mean, you know, and these are some things that are I wanted to kind of mention. So I think the big thing I want to kind of maybe wrap up. This part of the podcast on is I want to encourage everybody to do your best with the hand that you're dealt all	
4	Of different life circumstances.	
2	Some of us had abusive families. Some of us have gone through divorces. Some of us have kids that we now have to watch that. Maybe you didn't even want to have like who knows like everyone has maybe you're sick. Maybe you maybe your maybe things are really really good.	
4	Maybe who knows everybody has their own circumstances, but I think trying to do your best with what you have is something that all of us should try our best to do does that make sense like tomorrow I could wake up and I could lose so much.	
2	Much like there could be a house fire and I lose both my mom and my sister and the house like that's that would be a major setback and my life would never be the same and who knows how I'll handle that who knows how he'll handle if tomorrow I found if I find out if tomorrow I find out who knows like I remember there's a time like I thought for a moment doesn't two moments.	
4	I come back to me right now that have like scared The Living Daylights out of me and if they had a Really happened, like what have changed my life forever.	
2	And I don't know how I would have dealt with it. Maybe I'll look back at all the stuff. I've said about positivity and stuff in the in the in the past and I'd be like, oh my God, like maybe if they had actually happened the way I thought they happened.	
4	I look back and be like asthma and you were completely delusional like who knows right?	
2	But I remember one time my sister fainted when she was like I was holding her and I thought she'd like died or something.	
3	Oh, it was tears of terrible feeling and one time.	
2	I thought I Had like a tumor. It wasn't a tumor. It was something very benign. It was not a very big deal at all. It was just me. It was me thinking. I had a tumor or something like that.	
4	And I remember when I thought that like it like it crushed my existence. Like I felt I'll never forget how I felt and how I felt like a dead man walking like I felt like, oh my God, look at all these people unaware that life could end tomorrow. I might even die tomorrow like it was a very weird moment for me. I forgot why I was sharing all that but at any rate. Like trying your best to make trying your best to make the best of a your situation I think is important. So anyway enough stuff about positivity, but those were definitely on my mind and I wanted to get that off my chest and I think you can help it can definitely help some of you as you're listening to this now going into a language learning Direction.	
2	I want to talk about math and languages.	
3	I've been realizing this more and more recently. It's been hitting me and it's finally starting to settle into my body learning another language in many. Ways is very similar to math and it is very logical what I mean by that is learning a language takes a certain amount of time.	
4	Like I realized that as an adult maybe not as a child, but as an adult for adults language Learners, you know it no matter what kinds of strategies using as long as your strategies are semi fine and their logical enough and they're good.	
3	It's going to take all of us roughly the same amount of time to progress in learning another language granted. Some people will progress Lil Bit faster some people will progress a little bit slower there are going to be differences per individual that's for sure, but generally speaking it's going to be about the same amount of time required per person when learning another foreign language.	
2	So for example, I was sharing the other day that generally it'll take people 800 hours of guided love guided study to achieve a B2 level in another language roughly. 800.	
3	Someone might do it in 700. Someone might take 800. Someone might take a thousand but it's going to be rare for take someone 1800 to get to a be too. Does that make sense?	
2	Like there's some variation but the variation is not massive and I think that's a comforting thought some people as I've been talking to people about this my real life some people take it in a very comforting way. Some people take it in the very pessimistic way some people go.	
3	Oh, that's really good.	
2	So if I dislike do if I get 800 guided learning hours, I'm going to be pretty damn close to a be too. I'm like, yep.	
3	You'll be there somewhere in the range, maybe a little below you might need an extra hundred or two hundred hours. Maybe a little above who knows right but generally speaking like yeah, you're gonna you're gonna be in the range.	
4	I toss on the phone with a guy little while ago. He's achieved a pretty solid a to in less time than it typically takes but not by that much took him about a hundred fifty hours typically takes 200 hours like you're in the range.	
3	So I think the biggest one major thing that we should all try and focus on is He's trying to focus on hitting those hours.	
4	How many hours of Studies have you done and be careful? I wanted to be guided learning hours not random study. You do on Duolingo things like that because number one the effectiveness is while it's effective in certain ways guided learning hours of an extra level of focus and they actually have a little bit extra impact behind them.	
3	I find and when it's guided learning hours and you're following and you have a teacher a supervisor supervisor a teacher a language code even a some kind of Program when you have something you're specifically following it creates an extra level of focus which allows the knowledge to sink in a little bit faster into your brain. So get those hours log those hours. I think that's a very powerful thing to be doing another language learning thing which helped a lot of people so I want to bring it to the podcast.	
2	I noticed people really found it useful when I shared it on Facebook. So I want to make sure I mentioned it on the podcast here it has to do it's more relevant to to Advanced speakers, but it's funny, right?	
3	Speaking practice. I find has diminishing returns as you get more advanced in the beginning stages. Let's say low intermediate and Below low intermediate and Below. There is a significant percentage of people who feel very afraid to speak and then much rather just do reading or text book or whatever. It is.	
2	A lot of people don't want they want to do speaking and speaking practice for those kinds of levels often is very powerful and often is very beneficial for them and it helps them to improve and move towards Kind of that Upper Intermediate phase now.	
3	Here's the thing that kind of casual conversation practice in doing that speaking practice. Once you achieved a B2 and Upper Intermediate phase or even maybe an advanced stage once rattles Advanced levels. Let's say this diminishing returns and it doesn't help as much. I see a lot of people who are who are reasonably advanced in a language like upper be to maybe a see one like they're really strong in a language, but they want to keep getting better and they tend to just do a lot of them. I don't know even myself.	
4	I've been guilty of it too. I don't know why I did it actually doesn't make sense.	
2	But a lot of us think we just need to do more conversation practice. We need to talk more use more Listen to More native speakers do it more which will help you. But in fact I do I do think that it's not the most effective thing you could be doing and the main reason why is that once you're at an advanced stage?	
3	You have enough language knowledge to avoid to basically avoid how do I say this? To get around the things you don't know how to say so if you don't know how to say if you want to say I'm angry, but you don't know the word for I'm angry you will you don't have to really struggle with it because your brain very quickly we'll just do a Switcheroo and you'll say I'm mad or I'll think of another way to say it is he reasonably similar thing and because of that you stagnate you don't improve anymore because you're just finding shortcuts in your mind around the things that you don't know how to say and that's why doing that conversation. Practice is not typically enough because you're just finding shortcuts are on the stuff. You don't know what to say and you're not really learning how to say those things and and on and on and on and so what I believe to be better, I find a very effective thing to be doing.	
2	There's a few things for those advanced level speakers number one read stories, whether it's novels whether it's short stories read you're going to find a lot of words. You don't know I promise you look write them down keep them in a keep them log to keep them tracked and in your day-to-day.	
3	And then do some conversation practice where you consciously go and try to use those words.	
2	That's gonna be really good for your read. I specifically push you towards fiction and not nonfiction fiction is going to introduce you to more types of words and nonfiction I find is generally the case number two is I want to push you to watching different types of videos or movies or TV shows where there's multiple people talking at the same time and generally you're going to struggle with that. Up, even if you're super Advanced, even if you're a C1 C2, you're still going to struggle. You're still going to find that difficult. Sometimes are going to say stuff.	
4	You didn't understand especially when it's a comedy like I remember I was talking to a pretty a very high level English speaker.	
2	I'm showing them short clip from Seinfeld the the TV show and it's like a little conversation.	
3	They really struggled they understood the general gist of what's happening, but they missed the nuances because there's a lot of cultural things. She didn't know the comedy is interesting comedy changes in every single language. It's not	
2	Exactly the same so make catching on the comedy and the inferences that are happening in that scene where really difficult to this English learner like and that'll happen to you too. So you have to practice what those scenes look up all the new words when you don't understand something Google it ask a native speaker and practice using those types of materials another great material. You can use a stand-up comedy stand-up comedy's incredibly difficult. I don't care how advanced you are. It's an is an even higher level of Comedy that is really hard to understand.	
4	So I think stand-up Midi is a big one for all of you to use as well.	
2	If you're at that advanced level those kinds of things are going to be like if you're not a native speaker.	
4	I don't care how advanced you are. Unless you've been practicing with those for a long time. It's really difficult. All those Advanced strategies. And here's how I know you want to know how I know because I know how strong I am and French and Spanish and I can easily I can easily find content that I don't understand everything for I can easily find stuff and I'm a legacy to level like I'm very strong I could easily.	
2	Onto YouTube and Google + and and Netflix.	
4	I could easily go find stuff and be like, whoa. What does that word mean? Huh? What does it mean? Let me look that up. Wait I missed that joke, what the heck? I didn't understand that joke.	
3	What joke, did he make let me like watch that again.	
2	Let me rewind.	
3	Oh, is that what he said? What is that expression? Only Google that expression. Oh, he's making a reference to King Louis XVI, because everyone in France knows that he had this stereotype and they're making a joke on that.	
2	I didn't know that I didn't go to school in France. How am I supposed to know Lou? We the whoever did blah blah blah when he was a king doesn't make sense do that and a little definitely help you improve. Anyway, I appreciate your attention you guys rock and we will talk very very soon. Bye for now. See you.
