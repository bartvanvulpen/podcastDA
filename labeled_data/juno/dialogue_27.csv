You'll hear the snare drum first with the big fat snare drum then without then back on. Welcome to the big fat snare drum podcast. This is part 2 of my conversation with joke leg. So if you haven't listened to part 1, I don't know why you clicked on this, but go back and listen to the beginning. All right, enjoy. A few more the questions were kind of a little more geeky, which I don't think your mind exactly. So do you find yourself changing eqs on samples that are going to be in a live setting like your go-to is a certain things you do before you export tracks really a question. I actually step back and from just the drums and approach it as look at as the stems everything that makes up the song. I I've really found that it depends on who's mixed in who's mastered it as to which frequencies are. Worked for whatever for whatever reason that particular song usually eight ten twelve K this Jesus and it just kind of ripping your head off and two three cases using some kind of bump there as well. And it definitely differs from genre and from track and from the juicer, but when you listen on Spotify or iTunes or whatever you got this is a really exciting energetic track, but when you break that down, Beyond that the MP3 the wife and look at the stems and you see what's been added in mix and mastering to give you that brightness to make you feel the excitement and you think about well, how's that going to sound? How's it going to sound on Rick has been selling PA. How's it going to sound on the broadcast mix? It's just going to sound harsh. It's going to sound really abrasive. And sometimes you look at listen with that with that mindset you listen to all the stones and go. Well. I need to take you this EQ certain spot on every single stem. Because they've just typed that on what the left and right in the monster, which is cool it obviously is done for a reason but then you follow all the way down to drums. And yeah, we're looking at collapse and snares and hi-hats particularly. Let specially open hats or crashes. You'll you'll find some of that exaggerated excitement there which will need to look at EQ wise. I think I pretty much have to do that with everything that I do. I try and duck the excitement out of things the sampling when I'm sampling it because it gives our front of house or your front of house engineer more musical space for them to add their thing if they do some track TV cues on the way your tracks in your sample sound then you're losing the opportunity to add some kind of magic in other areas. So it's and that's the stuff you learn by doing it and get it wrong and I've definitely got that wrong a bunch of times but Yeah, definitely in terms of I don't think there's nothing magic Sweet Spot formula wise I feel like getting your EQ right in your next level right is the most important thing and that all is a drummer really determines the story really comes into play with where that samples being played whether it's a sample. It's on a trigger on top of something else or it's stand alongside me planning. Our pad is like it kind of approach it slightly differently whether if I am going to put a clap on Snare drum a trigger to just enforce that sound. I'll generally like trying to find a way of cheating the Legacy a little bit old sort of just roll off the attack from the sample. So you're getting the attack Transit at the snare drum and the cooks almost like a fade-in. You've got the sample fading, you know took like milliseconds but your sample and Fades in just all the top of it. So you get the you get the attack from the acoustic snare and the sample is just kind of fading in kind of cheats the whole idea of you know, you samples not aligned I don't see why it's like I've talked about me at the transients before there's not one truck with a lie where I had like a day just to get on my mind up and running when it first came into the set from getting stems to dinner rehearsal to play alive. And I found that the best part was right the sound sonically was right at bass players amazing playing it on synth bass. It was great. I was playing the drum part right ahead a sample on the snare, but I was missing my husband acoustic kick in the choruses and it felt great. But listen back to it. I was missing the The 808 the to Nate await those on the track, which the best play was playing but there's something about the energy that was in unison with a kick drum that I was just missing. So what I did was I chopped every single note of the part the eighth of the pitch now and I put on my kick trigger and I automated every time I hit Kick Drum, it would change the note to the appropriate not and the sequence which made suddenly all the bottom end stuff was that was missing was there but I had really struggled to with a transient of Attack of the note with the kick drum just feeling super lazy and lay and that because of latency and that's when I discovered that the whole trick of just fading in the sample. You still get the note. You still get the tail of the clap snare on the on the snare itself, but you get a transient of the instrument you're hitting with a with a microphone on it doesn't make sense for sure. And I was going to say Jose videos go into detail on how to setup exactly what he's talking about right now. So go check those videos out - the best it's the best kind of bromo you can like. Can you come on toward the moon? Just sell my stuff the people of course. Yeah, so I know we've already discussed the no nose. But do you feel I know you're a big Champion for trying to convince people that you know, electronic drums and and using the software that you use and the way you use it is musical. So do you find there's a bunch of myths surrounding people that don't understand hybrid drums that you exhaustively kind of or exhaustingly if that's the right word. But just like it. Did you feel like you're defending a certain thing continuously with hybrid drums. There were two things. I think one is the whole actual tag line of Harvey drums. I mean, I caught myself as your so Harvard which was kind of an englishman's tongue-in-cheek response to what even does what does it even mean like Harry drums is become just a catchphrase right to assign to having an SPS X. Sure you're so great. You've got that. So what you now have a drummer but what that really means that's the first thing but also Maybe an overall perspective of musicians thinking that pop gigs are just easy and lowest common denominator in terms of what it requires from. You skillset wise and doesn't actually require much imagination, which I think is completely false. I find myself going. Well. Where wait a minute. What do you think happens in a pop gig? What do you know pockets all over the world? Just because it's not Jazz does it mean it's not intelligent and it's not it doesn't have real skill and thought that goes into it and Because backing tracks are prevalent thing that been around, you know decades. It doesn't mean that that's always the way it is and the way it has to be but also doesn't mean it's only intelligent. For instance. I on the other gig we have I'm very fortunate to have abandoned that are all producers and correct session players and like really musical people who are all experts in technology. So every stone that we craft every sample we automate and change is done for a reason it's done with that. Mindset of we do this because we're passionate about it. But also because you can and the more we do this and hopefully more people get this as well and catch on to the idea that they can apply that to their own they're doing but will suddenly be doing full pop shows on Arena level stages without any backing tracks, you know, because with some programming with some Automation and but mainly but visioning desire to put the hours in to do it you can get there and for me that is B is a really musical take on it. It's not just his on the track. We're not going to sample at any of the drums because it takes too long and it we don't know how to make all these sounds happen all the time because we're not iPads or the same with key like he's going to get one controllers. Therefore this going to place one sound. I personally don't think that's exciting at all. That doesn't inspire me at all. So it's that I could that was more. The thing really for me is that stop saying pop music's rubbish? It's great. It's requires a obviously is Do but it requires a lot of skill and there is many skilled people out there applying really great ideas to Big Pop shelves. There are obviously many many styles and varieties flavors of of how you go about in terms of live show. You can have players that are given moments to just really shred and rinse in musical moments and that's awesome. And then some gigs are like super technical with loads of program changes going on and that's all so awesome. It's subjective, isn't it our And for me, the really important thing is if you're going to a show on your spending $100 on a ticket to see a big gig you want to fill out your recognize the song first and foremost you want to feel like this is the song that I came forward and then everything else is a bonus. So for me, the starting point is well how to make this feel like the record and then how do we make this musical enough that you have four five six people on stage playing their hearts out playing these pop songs, and it's all live. That's the challenge. And going back to what you were saying about the kick and the snare. It was a good perspective because you were talking about how technically the samples coming from the kick and snare in real time. It sounds good in your ears. You're like this should be perfect. But you have are self-aware enough to listen to the mix and be like something's not working. There's something that people without really realizing it are going to be like this song isn't working and I'm kind of talking over what you're saying, but still drummers we need to step back is You're doing just because you want to do it or is it actually serving the song and make sure that it makes sense and it feels good totally. And it's the same application isn't it to what you play and the Martin notes that you play where you play in the sun? Whether you're using electronic acoustic drums. It's that musicality. It's the awareness of your serving the song. It's the same as with electronics as well. I mean, I learnt that the hard way in a sense. Like I said earlier that always using the same. Tampon a kick or time and we were in theaters. I think it's like a US tour I might for a nice guy was like this is banging and then we did an arena support show and the feedback I got was this sounds Dreadful. This sounds like the bottom end is so muddy and Undefined what has changed its changed. It doesn't study. I'm sure you'll like words what he's worth. Well, obviously the worst thing you want to hear right? Yes, the MD in my in least in my experience bmd job these days is as much being a mix engineer and a kind of like white producer is it is telling people what notes to play sure by that nature is for me My Religion from the house Engineers like one of the most crucial things in the kick because they they're the bottleneck day. Whatever you create. Of you ultimate whatever mixed decision you make they have to interpret that and work with that. So when you get a response from our psychic your bottom end to sounds terrible. How do we fix it? Like why I need to learn from that. I need to figure that out straight away and there are lots of small small things that go into solving those problems. But one of the I found was just ditching the kick trigger just one last thing. It's clutch up the mixing that frequency range because we just didn't eat It we've got a great kit. It's great sounding bass drum. We got a great engineer the kick sounds great. But also on a black a bigger broader a broader perspective is died the foundation of things in the mix like your bottom and let your bass guitar your bass drum the things that feel familiar from the given the set the end of the set don't mess with those things. If you can like keep your Kick Drum your Kick Drum make it great make it reliable that it that's the one thing that doesn't change song for song and so your foundation. That from this perspective and what I was doing was I was checking the kick sample every song and yeah, it was like the record. It sounded great my ears. It sounded great in a theater geek but in Arena it was unnecessary and it cluttered the mix. Sure. Okay. Well Joe, I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me and talk to all these drummers that are listening about all the fun geeky stuff that you might not think we want to hear. But this is what everyone wants to talk about honestly cool and well, I've got at least one of the It's not another gets it so moving forward where can people find you and where can they download the new video series your so hybrid. If you go to my Instagram you which is just act like drums in the bayou that link will take you straight to it. It's on gumroad, which is a really cool platform for streaming service. Yeah, if people interest in anything I'm talking about then yeah, I'd encourage you to go check that out these very current other than that. Tomorrow morning. I'm liking the new office for a week as an empty and then I've got some stuff with Ali and I'm releasing my own instrumental EP which is pretty crazy. Scary. That would be November trying to build a studio. There's a lot of stuff going on. Alright. Well, thank you and have a good day Joe. Thanks so much having to take care. No problem.
