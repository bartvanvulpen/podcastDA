1	So you say something funny and then it beeps? He says something funny on command. We're testing it out fucking will be. So today mean Isabelle going to be talking about depression Isabel's my cyst and we both have depression. So that's why we're talking about it today both think we can offer some advice and just share our experiences with it. A lot of people say that they have depression when they don't and they're just sad so there's like a difference between being depressed and just sad so I'm going to read the DSM-5 criteria, so It says the individual must be experiencing 5 or more of these symptoms during a two-week period and they are depressed mood most of the day nearly everyday markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement that eager loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day recurrent thoughts of death recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. Rude, yeah, rude, they are so rude. That is so rude. Yeah. Hit me where it hurts the most. Yeah. Yeah, so When did you kind of realize like you have that like, oh shit moment. Like I have depression it was with you. Actually we were in we're going to see our dad and Florida and you're just hanging out on the beach and I said, I was 12 I said hey. Even when you get in the car, do you sometimes like like not want to put your seatbelt on just like if you get in a car accident, so you'll die in the not have to wake up and you said no. Nope, I don't remember that at all. Wow. Yeah, so I realized that no one else around you want to get hit by a bus. Yeah, and like everyone has different like Degrees of depression so when I say have depression, I mean very recently after our father passed away. I got depressed but I wouldn't say like I've clinical depression all the time. Mmm. It was a very depressed period of my life. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself depressed. But as you would, you know, well, that's a big difference to like there's a normal scale of like grief that people experience but mine was passed that they're like, there's no right way to grieve. Yeah. But I think my grief turned into severe depression because it lasted for like a year and it became well, that's when it persists. It's that's what it's different. Yeah, but it was far too hard DSM-5. Yes, but it was triggered by something. So whereas yours was just like always kind of present your whole life. Yeah. I can look back and be like, yeah like yeah, we saw that I would always say like and as well as also bipolar Sorry by pulling impressive. Yeah. Yeah, so but I remember thinking when I was six like there's a good Isabel on a bad Isabel and we pretend that she had an evil twin named Bethany. Oh, yeah, let's Bethenny. Yeah. And so whenever like we'd be eating at the dinner table, Bethany would be looking at me with like these dagger eyes and I feel like I can't tell my mom the Bethany's here. Like I have to pretend it's Isabelle like yeah, I get so nervous. Like Bethenny would be in the card. Like I remember just being terrified of When Bethenny came out no one was having a good day. Yeah savagery. Yeah, it was savagery. But I think one thing people don't realize about depression is how much of your life that you miss out on and just completely blank on like Olivia has this whole memory. I don't have any memory of it at all. I didn't remember Bethany until she just said Bethenny right now and like I'm assuming that's the right name, but I don't Bethenny, but I don't have a memory of it. We would do it at summer camp to to like freak out the kids out. Hmm. So and I was so used to it. It was so normal for me. Yeah, but other people I'm sure thought we were like crazy. Yeah. Is the point I'm trying to make is that depression can take away periods of your life with leaving you with no memory almost like holes and associating kind of not associating you look back and you don't remember anything. Yeah, like literally have memories that people have your brain is empty. Yeah. That's very sad. Emptiness is a good word. I think but it really do be like that. So I really do be like that it really do. I think this is like so after my dad died, I remember one day I was going on a run and I usually love to run but this run was hard and then all of a sudden I just started like sobbing. And like it hit me like then that I wanted to kill myself and like that's what I all I could think about the whole run was how is going to kill myself when I got home? No when I got home, but like in the future like when I was going to do it all this stuff and I just told my mom right away. I was just like this is very abnormal for me. Like I got put on an antidepressant and it helped immediately almost But that was a phase of my life where if I am afraid to go off my antidepressants because like what if I do have depression now mmm, you know, and it's just the medicine just works. So well, you know and it's not like that for everyone that comes so lucky that like it was a period, you know, definitely Well medicine is hard because it it only works just to such an extent where you kind of had to put in the work to you know what I mean? Like it'll give you the tool in your toolbox exact. It's not the whole box. Yeah, definitely. So on top of it to the Press since it doesn't mean you can just take a pill like go about your day. You actually have to actively like tell your brain. Hey, dude, shut the fuck up. Yeah, you'll lot of things you don't need. Kill yourself you genuinely don't ya and sometimes it's like reminding yourself like all the good things you have which sounds really cheesy but that's actually helped me a lot just sitting on my bedroom floor. I'm being present and being great. Yeah and like Isabel like it's so good. Like she'll go outside with her crystals and like charger crystals and do some like stretching like she didn't need to do that before she does things for herself now, like go to like comedy nights and stuff, which I think is really awesome. And she's definitely like has come a long way. It's all comes down. Down to just being kind to yourself. You can't be angry at yourself for not making progress every single day. You're not going to make progress every single day might regress. Yeah, you're going to live with it for your whole life. So you have to be kind to yourself about it and you have to reassure yourself. Like you're not always going to be in this mood and just kind of today not every day is going to be exactly and just keep encouraging yourself and being nice to yourself and the nicer you already yourself the more that like guilt that comes with depression will go away. I think that's kind of also how I knew that I had depression was because I had All this guilt for know that's a big part of it. Yeah, and I was just like there was a point where I was like calling people and saying sorry for things that I didn't even need to say sorry for her because I just couldn't fathom why I was feeling so bad about myself. Yeah. That was like I did something wrong, you know, like these people hate me and I think that's another thing with depression is like it really is storts your view about you're like purpose and your place on this earth like you really do think no one loves you sometime so definitely, but you're not lovable, you know. Mmm. or that it would be better off or you wouldn't be affected and like something that I've had a hard time with is just like I always tell myself now like most things aren't the end of the world. Which is a good thing, but also like the world's going to keep going, you know, yeah, definitely and I think that's a thing that people with depression is just like why am I here? Like, they're very smart people that are depressed. Oh, yeah, definitely have a lot like most people have a higher IQ if they're depressed because they just are so aware of everything that's like going on in the dusty. It's not like when everything is thriving in the world depression rates go up like it's directly correlated with kind of the state of things. Yeah, because people Like we're affected by each other quietly gently genuinely are affected by each other. If you're having a bad day. I I consider myself an empath. I don't have a good day either, you know, like if people that I really love like our are sad like, I can't be happy. Yeah are genuinely happy. For me, I just think it's like I think a lot of the problem is like depression in this first world country when you have all these Comforts is like I literally have no reason to be depressed right now that makes it worse and it makes you make yourself feel guilty. Did you just sit on it? The guilt? The guilt is a really interesting thing. Like I remember being like Five and like putting away like my first tour was ever was like putting away dishes in the dishwasher and there were like big forks and little forks. And I was like, I don't want to separate the little forks from the big Force because like the baby force them on me for seem to be together and I felt like I was like the worst human ever for doing that. You know what I mean? Like I always even then I always needed to have a reason for why I was guilty. Yeah, I would I just felt guilty because I was always so angry. Yeah. Like anger is a secondary emotion, you know? Yeah, definitely. Another thing about being this angry in this cute. Is that when you get angry everyone around you goes? No, you just make me like five to give or take an inch. Yeah, so normally takes us seriously. Yeah, definitely. People laugh when I get mad. Oh, yeah. That's how I know like, okay well, but they're like all that chipmunks having a bad day. I know. Oh, yeah. I feel like there's a lot of stories. I have that about depression that like a lot of things where I'm just like normal quote-unquote like morals neurotypical people just like wouldn't think this way mmm, you know, but like what are some like misconceptions you think about depression that That don't have it. Kind of like Get wrong. I just think the number one thing is that People aren't kind enough to people with depression. They're not patient enough and they expect too much. So they don't view it as something that's seriously chemicals are incorrect in your brain that affects you every day. That is almost like a physical weight on you every day when you wake up. That's not what they do it as they just say like they think you can snap out of it, especially if you're high functioning especially for high functioning like I go to work every single day. I work six days a week and every day someone tells me you like you make my day all the time. You always make me smile, you know, because I'm such a high-functioning depressive and the other day. I said, you know, I am really struggling right now think I got to go see a new therapist or something and there's this almost they said, oh you have depression and I said, yeah and they said I would have never guessed the yeah you had depression because the way you carry yourself. Yeah, it's just but that tape but they don't understand how much effort that takes out of someone. And almost when people tell me that sometimes I'm like, thank you honestly, but also like doesn't have a look. It doesn't have a not always. Yeah, it does sometimes like oh you can't like look at somebody like they're having a bad day. But like eyes exactly why I think it's important to talk about it because you wouldn't expect certain people you wouldn't expect to be depressed and they jammed the happiest people like yeah are depressed like Robin Williams, for example, he was very very depressed and he was always making people laugh. He said something really good about depression, which I think like we need to hear it out. It was like it was something along the lines of yes depression is a crippling illness that is not 100% Like people aren't 100% in control of but I also do believe that if you are not thinking the right things actively eating the right things actively hoping actively loving yourself actively. Then you are not giving yourself a Fighting Chance. That's so true. You cannot just give yourself with who? There was a point at school and I think I tend to get more depressed when I'm stressed and it is depression because like there was a point where I could not get out of my bed for eight days. Yeah. It did not leave my apartment for eight days and all I ate was Oreos. Yeah, and that just perpetuated the cycle. Like if I had healthy food, you know, I probably would have just been invented my like right mind but I literally as well knew I was calling her like crying. I'm like, I was depressed like it was hard. Yeah, and it's hard for me because like we were saying earlier like Olivia wasn't always. This way it was always me so then me seeing the way that I've always been on Libya someone who always be this happy. It was really hard. It was really see ya because a lot of people give me that way too and I wasn't fake either. It was very genuine. So after my dad died, I went on antipsychotics just because I was I needed to be stabilized because I wasn't doing well. I had a lot of PTSD. Yeah, and I didn't laugh for four months and it was the scariest thing because I felt like I couldn't Make emotions. Yeah, I didn't have emotions and it was Yep, jarring yet and that's why when my I feel like my my mood is kind of getting getting really bad. I don't immediately jump the gun and say, okay, let's medicate. I kind of step back and wait it out and be patient with myself and be kind to myself. You can look hopeful for towards the future and then you'll find so much better like think about how you coped back then even versus now like definitely changing holes in walls now you don't do that anymore. Yeah. I know. I'm 90. I can still punch a good hole in the wall. Yeah, I don't do that anymore. Yeah, I just go to hardcore shows. Yeah, we're it so punch other people. Where's okay to hit people. Yeah, they wanted they literally want it. Yeah, it's gonna pay for it. And another thing with depression finding those Outlets that you can be that place where you can see angry at. Yeah, there's always some anger like late and anger. You never really know about. Yeah, but that that bitching third grade Duty told if you're angry that I farted. Yeah when it was her, yeah. Yeah, that would make me angry still. Yeah. Yeah, but like I'm not saying you need to go but all your friends go to all your friends talk about how sad or angry you are, but I personally like my best friend. We love ranting to each other above pick things that make us angry to friend you leave that person to we're not each other's therapist, but it sounds fuck I fighting to fucking go off. You know what I mean? Like she's there to listen and she thinks it's funny. You know what I yeah, like again when I'm small but I'm angry like Funny regardless, yeah, so having that person that you guys kind of both enjoy and you feed off each others, like fuck this and you kind of just get that out for today Twitter was invented. That's why Twitter was invented. Yeah, honestly, like it's so good for like my depression because I'm just psyched about Twitter. Yeah. I heard about Twitter. My favorite thing about Twitter is when the mainstream media goes Okay, we're going to put together this story. For example Epstein yet committed suicide. Hope it works. They sends it out immediately Twitter. Oh how motherfucking convenient a billionaire with tons of dirt commit suicide. So K and it just immediately air quotes immediately on Twitter everyone blew up and was like, yeah. No and that's why I love Twitter. I love Twitter and it's a conglomerate a fucking Pete. I love those like memes that go viral. It's just like my depression my eating disorder my anxiety like all meeting up and it's like all those people doing the damn. Yeah, I love that like then it yeah, I mean, I think another another misconception that depressed people or mentally ill people have is mentally ill people have is that they're in this alone like no one understands what they're going through. That's not the fucking case. There are literally millions of people that feel actually exactly the way that you do and I'm sure neither of you can describe that feeling because it's okay and that's why No one thinks that anyone feels like them. Yes, but you have to communicate and be like no dude. I feel big sad sometimes to fix a big sad and that's okay. You know, I think another moment where I realized I had depression was where I was like laying down in bed with my friend and he was trying to tell me that like there was like more to life than like than what I was seeing and he was like people love you like your friends just all came over and you like made them all breakfast and like all the stuff and I was like, no one loves me like yeah, I'm like unlovable and I was crying and I didn't want anyone like like nothing anyone said could change the fact that I thought no one loved me. Yeah. Yep, or did I was like, there's nothing you can say and he was just like so sad like he was crying. Yeah, and I was like, why are you upset and he was like cuz I care about you and I was like, I don't know what yeah. Yeah, but once one time when I realized I was not in a good spot was when you my boyfriend, we're going to Chick-fil-A and big complex of just like people going and shopping and shit and there was like a really happy family of like a mom and a dad. Three kids. They're all like gigglin the kid was holding the mom's hand. I just gestured out the window and loudly said I don't want to see that. Really? Yeah, and then there was like Isabel, that's a perfectly Pleasant situation.	
2	That was like gross.	
1	Oh my gosh, you know just like secondhand anger at someone else's content with life if that makes any sense. Yeah, that's it. Again. You see how people in relationships and you're like fuck them. Yeah, that's like a big big thing that to this day. I'm working on conquering you know what I mean be another comes conception with depression is that one are going to be like done not suppress. That's not how fucking work. Yes, literally. It's just I mean it's going to keep coming back. So you better get used to it. You better be nice to yourself and you better learn how to tame it. It's like it goes thoughts feelings behaviors. Yeah. So like if you get a nasty thought try to cut it like nip it in. The bud isn't becomes a feeling in your feelings feel real now that it can become a behavior. Yep, you know, definitely it's a cycle so and yeah, then sometimes the behaviors could take over because So tired you can just sleep and it just feel everything perpetuates. Yeah the thing so literally it's to be as simple as being like this thought is wrong. Oh, my feelings are not real. Yeah. It's are valid control of your brand. Yeah. Absolutely. And again, that's the number one number. One thing I'm concerned about with people who just run to medicine is that they're not actually addressing the thoughts and taking control of them. They're just putting metal BT C BT exactly. Cognitive behavioral therapy not to because you have to find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia, you're straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms another big thing. That's big wrong. Yeah, but yeah another think therapists a good therapist not easy to find you now. I'm so sorry. I have a good one now. Yeah Isabel therapist actually yet. My I just I hadn't sanaka therapist. Yeah, one of my therapist was like yo look, I've seen you for a year now and this is what I think is going on. I could lose my license for this but I'm going to say it you're being haunted by a demon and I was like hon, I'm paying you $60. I'm paying you say. Yeah. I was a session to tell me that I have a fucking demon in me.	
2	No that ain't it Chief. It's called depression.	
1	Yeah, that's what it literally is a demon though, but in a different way, but she was like you need to go to literal like well, yeah. Fuck you, bitch. Yeah, and then she was like she tried to tell me that well, I was at the time I was like I was a lot younger so I was like so like, oh do I like girls and she was like, yeah demons can make you think homosexual thoughts and I was like, oh no, that's why I like titties. Like bitch know I like titties kiss titties are greater. Great.	
2	Yeah.	
1	Um, so yeah finding a professional that works will be that's not homophobic. That isn't crazy. ABS is not easy all the time. Genuinely and where that hasn't been through anything. So we're like well, maybe you should meditate. Yeah, you're just not going to buy with some of them. Yeah, like, you know, like when you're going to school if I go to like college, I went to UMass for three years and there were so many girls that were getting psyched agrees. That just made me laugh because I was like, you literally have no empathy but you don't understand through any psyche at all because you learn you can read about it in a book. Yeah you can read about Like anxiety, but if you don't have anxiety, you just don't know what it's like. Yeah, and these are the same girls that II that something goes wrong with their friends they call up their fucking mental health with their school and send them away. You know, like they do not there they do not know or care even to take the time to understand the emotion that you're feeling. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of it is just like making an effort to understand what your friends are going through and like my thing is Don't treat people the way you want to be treated treat them the way they want to be treated sometimes like yes and have you don't understand? Yeah, like yeah. We're not the same time just to say yeah, how can I support you? Hmm? Yeah, like I've been having a rough month my good friend just said what can I do to make sure that you're safe and to provide you support that's really weird. And if we're good sighs. Do you want to give you want to give your friend support? Yep, without being their therapist. You can still ask for support like that's where humans me. That you know, yep, and I literally told her send me a meme or two. I'll hit you up when I need you. Yeah, sometimes it's as simple as a setting for someone that's sad like so and just being like I'm here, you know living in talk. We cannot talk we can watch TV at like my presence shows that I care. Definitely. I don't have the words for it. Yeah, you know. So I guess that's how to help a depressed friend is just to be there for them. Yeah and like and not give up on them. Even if they don't come to all your social Gatherings key inviting them. Yeah, because they want to know the people still love them. Yeah, and that just reinforces like, oh no one loves me like, you know, just like invite them places, like even if they don't go like kind of have the expectation that like if you're like plans are going to like if you make plans with them like they might fall through and like that's okay like be kind to them. Yeah. Be understanding and if they're really pissed about something like I do is with my family too and like they probably need a little extra love. Yeah. Yeah and just let them be angry, you know exiled them a little extra love when they're feeling really intense emotions because even though that's when you want to love them the least until they needed the most definitely, you know, yeah like the other day. My mom was in a really really bad mood yelling at me for no reason and I instead of being like upset. I was just like I just walked up to her and gave her a hug and just it was just like how how like and she started crying and I wasn't so she was sad. Yeah, you know and I was just like so like I immediately was like, okay. She probably needs a little extra love definitely. These kids came into my work the other day and they said some sick shit. They were like, oh when I was a kid, I used to feed alka-seltzers to seagulls. So they would blow up what the heck and I literally like my heart actually started in my chest. I feel so sick and I just said dude. Can you come across the counter? I'm going to give you a hug because apparently your parents never Hugged you you don't just do that if you got hugs, so I came around the counter and I gave him a big hug. We said I'm a pretty messed-up guy that said you should go to therapy. You said, you know what? I'm considering it and then we talked about therapy. That's another thing and that see that is not the response. He was looking for he was looking for me to be like had a heavy that Titans of the bird. Hey Emma. No I said I said yo your parents didn't hug you. Yeah, that's it. That's an animal. You know what I mean? Like could have been like what kind of sick fuck are you would yeah, sick fuck regardless. Don't get me wrong. But do I want him to go on to be a serial killer? No show him. Why don't ya	
2	Exactly.	
1	Well those profound thank you. That really was that changed like that. I've been thinking about that later time again. I'm not always an upstanding citizen the other day saw kid wearing a trump shirt went up to him and said hey asshole dumb fucking shirt, and then I walked away. So like I am not always tolerant like that's that's not to say I'm always a fucking piece love ya person. Like I have my mole of unity respect. Yeah, you know Fleur Fleur life, baby. They'd always the case. But I try as hard as I can and that's all you can do. That's all you can do and again like that comes back to like kind of what I was talking about are just being kind to yourself. You know, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall back. It's okay, but if you're mean to yourself, you're going to sink down deeper into it. So what I used to do when I was in high school. Yeah. I know I'd be like, yeah, I fucking suck. Ooh, I'm going to go do this and then feel worse about myself and be like Oh, my life sucks. I'm like, yeah. Yeah for me. Yeah for me then your victim card gets maxed out and you're like I need to make some changes definitely, you know, there comes a point when you're just like damn it really be all me not all you but like well, no, it didn't a its. It says I don't know. It's just your responsibility to take care of it, but it's not your fault. No exactly. Yeah, because like you it's not your fault that your brain isn't firing neurons correctly and like you don't have enough chemicals. Of Serotonin or dopamine? You can't regulate go green like it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with it a hundred percent. Yeah, because you know, you don't want to be you don't want to be kind of putting out more sadness into the world if that makes sense. Yeah, if humans don't have a way out like if a cell doesn't have a way out it will die. Yeah, like it doesn't have any pores. Yeah, it will like become full of its own waste and die and that's like people if they don't have any Outlets they become I'm full of negativity and they can't Thrive. Yeah, you know really? Well that's where made up ourselves. Yeah, exactly. And so it's like just making those channels to connect with things that you really love isn't really important because if you get in the flow state where you're like, I'm forgetting that time is a thing. I'm forgetting about everything else like when you paint or like stuff like that like that's when You're happy. Yeah when you're going out, yeah, not even happy but just like it was kind of music and yeah concerts and dancing or after something you forget or moshing for a while pockets are the best or they make you remember when they play that one song. Yeah. It's remember that memory and just cried out. Yeah, that's so true. Yeah. A depression is a bitch it can make you think a lot of things that aren't true, but just know that. Your thoughts aren't always real and just note that even though it does not seem like it you have the ability to overcome it. Yeah, it's in you it's in all of it's not gonna happen overnight. Hmm definitely but it can get better and it does get better like speaking as someone in high school who's always thinking about dying. Yeah now I'm 22 almost I don't think about die every day definitely. It's good. Yeah, and if you obviously like this goes without saying almost like if you're feeling these negative thoughts like please tell someone like people want to hear it people would rather hear you complain then hear about you dying a hundred percent. So like there's outlets for that too. Like there's support groups. Like there's so many things you can try like so many things you can try and it's not like It's not like one thing it's not like maybe one thing is going to fix you. Like it's going to be a bunch of different things that you use in your little toolbox exactly to get better. So find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia your straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms enough.
