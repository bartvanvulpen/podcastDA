1	Hey everybody. Thank you for joining us for the challenge. This is episode 5 the greatest showman War of the Worlds. I think Wes said it best when he said these British people looked them and they act them but they are not dumb. Here's break it down right now stay tuned you're tuned in to AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of tv top now look,	
3	That's right. AfterBuzz. All right.	
1	Hey, okay. Whoo you guys yeah. This is the know. I'm very happy and very very cool. I know all the coolest moves.	
3	Thank you.	
1	Thanks Josh in the studio knocking welcome. Thank you guys so much for joining us. This was a great episode. We had a challenge that we have to go over. We had a tribunal with a lot of action. We had drama and we had a killing floor. So we are going to get into all of that tonight. I am Pamela gross. Thank you for joining us.	
3	And with me is Daniel Lindgren here Danny drama, especially because everything Wesson d a my team my team as always David Christopher was going on guys. Yes a very loaded episode. Yeah. It was good.	
1	It was it was good. It was loaded. Let's start with just our overall thoughts. Do you I'll kick it off my overall thoughts were this is the turning point in these games where you really start seeing the good competitors and the people that are floating by and the not so good competitors there starts to be a clear line. And this is where this is where it gets real.	
3	Yeah, my overall thoughts you've got two guys. That is mainly what you're talking about tonight. And that's the what bear did all the things that Zach did right and I think that we're going to I think that people what no matter what we We say they're going to be some people that loved it. Some people that hated it. No one is going to agree. This is like politics tonight and no one is going to agree on those two at what they did. You totally just came in like I was I felt like is watching SportsCenter and now doing you're talking about like a highlight from the game or something that you just came down to just like own it dude. That's like yeah. Yeah. No, but I agree man, you know pick a side, but personally I you know, as far as the overall thought of the episode of that was great there was, you know, good drama in there. It didn't drag too long, but it's also fun to watch the challenges were great. I wasn't stuck to the whole bear thing. I personally kind of just disgusted by it. Yeah, but we'll get into that.	
1	Well, we also will be bringing you guys tonight a special segment, which is the top five reasons. Why bear is a big gimmick, so we will give you our hot takes on that soon. Let's start with the challenge. So well first we go into the setup of the evening in the house tonight. So we get to see like Polly and Cara canoodling and Zach and Kyle. I'll once again talking about Cara right? So that's sort of the lead in for the drama that we get and then we roll right into the tired out challenge. So they had to they were chained to their partner. They had to run look at a puzzle pick up a tire and stack it and they had to do that 14 times.	
3	What would you guys think of that best challenge the season so far? These are my favorite kind of endurance. I love endurance. I love that they chain them together because that's going to be the producers I give the purse. A hard time a lot. This is a great move. It's going to be guaranteed drama and also D got sweaty and all kinds of places and I love me some juice. Okay, so bam. All right, sounds good. I love me some dee dee dee. Yeah, I agree with you man as far as the challenge. No, it was it was an awesome challenge man in you know, one word is dead lifts practice. Those deadly is getting those tires in the beginning. That's exactly what that was. You're just flipping tires. That thing is heavy here in the desert. It's hot as hell. You know, I mean in then you got how many of those things back and forth back forth.	
1	So I mean that is insane.	
3	This was a lot of endurance and you know again, like you said it weeds out the weak from the strong and your yeah see exactly Who's Gonna Come Together? Who's gonna crack? Yeah, solve it that bottom Tire you work out a lot. You probably do a lot more legs than I do how much that bottoms higher way. Oh, dude, that first one no idea because there is what like how many likes it but 13 tires or something was out with some were bigger than the bottom one was like the biggest one the bottom one was the biggest one. I'm just wondering Weight Wise if you could tell us in the live chat how much that bottom Tire way for all your worker outers there.	
1	Yeah. So a few observations that I had from that challenge is one. I don't know how everyone was doing it we saw different approaches Pauly and not ninja Natalie who won were rolling it. It's like this is round. Why are you carrying and roll it Hunter exciting ones? Yeah. That was awesome. Hiker surprised me with his total gassing out. I've never seen that from him, especially that early and especially when Georgia was like come on man. And my other thing was Maddie stood out as strategizing. She was like, we're safe. We have the Relic this week and I'm just going to watch how teams interact and learn which is a good thing for a rookie to do that's a good place to be and yeah worry about so why you no kill yourself doing this and you're fine.	
3	Yeah. It's but I do agree. Sorry Dan, I do agree that, you know, it's just And Hunter, I like Hunter man. He's you can get a great cheap. But I you know, I thought he would perform a lot better. I was kind of bummed that he was kind of guess not like that giving up. Yeah. Yeah. I think the bigger guys like ash to he didn't do that. Well that hot in this challenge so Ash and Hunter I'm totally shocked and Hunters endurance and that was that low. And yeah, you know, that's the thing about being tied with your partner and white so interesting because one person's got more endurance than the other right? It's so true and I thought that like I know Wes indeed didn't win but I thought their endurance was around the same. Mm, and obviously I didn't even get in the top three but like you're not in West is so smart. He's not going to fight with someone. That's that's there and right. Let me see about Zach to he obviously last season with Amanda treated her awfully and they both just treat each other off Lee, but he I thought for honestly exact. I thought he did treat Z to the entire time. He's been here the five episodes. I thought he treated her great. I thought they were great fun team. He never got mad at her he yeah, I I don't know. It was just it's a different side of Zach. Obviously. I Stand his relationship with his girl because that needs to end but I thought I liked his relationship was a hit as a friend. You know, that's that's a good point. And I agree with you on that one too. I think as far as the heater goes it actually went. Well, I think they did. Well, they got along really good. They talked about everything there was there was not a whole lot fighting nothing. Yeah, I agree.	
1	That was actually I think was a good pairing between the two my hot take on Zach and we'll get more into him and his drama more observations about Zach at this point. I feel like he's salty and he's over it. I don't think he really has any heart in the game. I think he kind of enjoys riling people up and he is miserable. He's like a bad energy force in the house. He seems pissy mean jerky and he doesn't seem to really want to win that much.	
3	Yeah. I know, you know, it's funny to even say that because this challenge is I feel like it's we saw that a lot. This is specific episode this specific car competition. I mean, you know same thing with like we said Hunter normally he Hunters got a lot of harps. Yeah weird. Obviously bear quitting. That was well. You know like yeah, and then you know since yeah, Zach's I will grow through Zach too kind of seems like he's hard to not fully. Yeah, you know, it's just it's weird. It's really weird to see that especially from these competitors that you wouldn't necessarily. Yeah, I think you know now I'll get into the fair thing real quick here because it's part of this this challenge. I don't really hate that he got mad that he was having to carry day through that thing. I don't mind that because he clearly his endurance was better than hers. Right? Like we're saying One's Gonna have the endurance and ones on your chain together. She have to stay together. I don't mind him being Frustrated about that because I know if I was destroying the challenge and of course David you're struggling I'd be mad of course, not me. But no, I'm just saying that I understand the frustration why you quit is just dumb and obviously but he's getting the face time that we had talked about Pam.	
1	Right? That is that was a stunt a gimmick ridiculous everything he did and sure he made a mark he made waves, but that's where we live in a strange time where these social media and Stars and pseudo celebrities. There's been a lot of I always sort of trust people might do are things for air time and pick up games. This seemed to me like the biggest gimmick stunt BS. I'm going to fake throw Tantrums fake. I'm going to play this character of The over-the-top Jerk that it took me out of it to some extent like I'm even having a hard time being pissed you bear cuz it's like you don't believe that you're just pretending to be it's like I'm gonna throw up. Tantrums on air and be the back the crazy guy which takes some of the Integrity out of the game for me. I and especially watching poor Dave on who cares who you are playing for a million dollars. I don't know what bears and game is or what he wants clearly doesn't want to win a million dollars or he would not be behaving that way and and taking it that few wants to get himself on another show and he's probably gonna do that with his with all these events.	
3	But no, yeah. I can't stand there. Yeah. I don't understand why he You're watching and you're like, I mean, I want him to make good points about being mad. But then he's spitting out nonsense and I'm like, I'm not even mad at you. I'm bored with you because I don't care what you're saying because it means nothing you're saying stuff to say, I don't think he knew what he was saying half the time right he commented on the other clothing that Natalie D was wearing. Okay, who came because her fashion sense. What are you doing becomes like really like you lose engagement. Yeah, you just kind of like we did. Yeah, you're just like it literally seems so Dis Jamie you're like this? This is not this guy's this is clearly an act. He's trying to make you know character for the show. He wants a TV time. Exactly personally. I got was I that I got disconnected. I was like, okay, I don't mean by this.	
1	I agree and we were like midseason maybe at this point nitish and I feel like he's been flying under the radar apparently in his last show, which I didn't watch. She was the drama that the main drama sir. Like it's like if bananas went on Big Brother and was The chill guy in the house, you know, I feel like it's like that. He was like I got to make some noise. I got to make some action.	
3	I feel like I mean, he likes sorry not to jump like a frat boy just on the table randomly. Yeah, it was so obvious and apparent. It's like he's going for a tension.	
1	That's kind of yeah, and when he quit so when he quit he's saying y'all are bums. You're not fit to She thought he was saying those things to his Alliance and his friend, you know, the only people that were ahead of him at that point that you knew were winning were Cara, Paulie and someone else from what they showed us, you know, right but at that point it's like we lost we're gonna die. I'm not doing it and he's calling people the c word he is just so over the top that say what we will about a Cara and a poly and all of that car has yelling at Zach and blowing up. At him sincere you can see her like shaking with hurt like that is a real relationship a real hurt. That was betrayed. This was all just clap back stun. What can I do to make a scene?	
3	Let's say this though, even though bear cause all that drama he's here for another week. Think about that. He couldn't have caused more drama and he still avoided The Killing.	
1	Well, that's and let's see if this first of all what I tell the people Dan, I think you've got it.	
3	Yeah, I just want Thank you guys for making us the ESPN of TV talk. That's what I want to say. I want you to hop on YouTube, you know subscribe subscribe subscribe. And you know, if you're on iTunes, you know, give us one of those five star ratings not a 4 star 5 Star we are just like the hotels we all like to stay at. Yeah being a part of AfterBuzz means a lot to all of us. So we just want to thank you guys and you know keep watching our shows. Thank you.	
1	Yes, and thank you all who are joining us on the live chat. We like it. We're taking a look right now since the guys.	
3	How's it going out there?	
1	So we at the end of this tired out challenge our winning three teams, which form the tribunal are ninja Natalie and Polly Nani and turbo who are the best and Cara and Theo quick thing on turbo.	
3	I don't think he broke a sweat in that first challenge, by the way. I honestly did he just like, all right. Let's go. Here we go. Yeah, I got a turbo has really grown on me. I like that guy. I enjoy we have that emotional talk with nany at the beginning of the episode before the thing and I that was sincere so we can all say how Bears was off. All tonight arise clearly doing it. Like I turbo was not doing that for the cameras. You got having one would not see the camera was there turbo is the antidote to Bear.	
1	He's like so adorable. So sincere. Yes The Shining Star I think so far the breakout star, I would say him and the CEO of the guys the new guys thinking of that and he's not faking anything like he seems so sincere which is why it's so sweet. I mean the things he says, he's I call her mommy because she's it's like that's a little weird. But very sweet I love her so much. He is a tea is adorable so teams that we that I like one. So that's cool. You know, then we get into the tribunal. So let's break that down first coming in so they devote. Okay. Well, what do you guys think of the tribunal because car sort of took over when they walked in?	
3	Yeah, well car was was she was like the longest standing got a Nani was in there. But I mean she's been gone for a little while now and then who was the other vet that was in there technically. Is a poly he's a hero, he's not well technically he's been back for the second season. But yeah, so yeah, she car takes control and kind of gets what she wants and then you got a throwaway vote with gustn Jenna. That was a throwaway obviously. So it was down to the we knew it was going to be between bear and yeah. Yeah, I do like how these tribunals of its it gets intense in there now. Yeah syrup is kind of like weird, you know? Yeah. No II think that's a noun. It's like it it seems like every time you're going in there. You're going to see some drama.	
1	Yeah. Well, I think you know it came in hot with Zach and Zahida coming in first. She had a little attitude which I think is fair to he's fine. I'm not know I like her no shade at that. But she did she wasn't going to you know, she was like it is what she and her bathing suit tonight Mike. Oh my God, I don't want to talk about no I'm saying I didn't notice what a hot little box yet under all that soapy saw her but but that's I don't have to find it's a pretty she's pretty she looked great. I was like, wow, look at that butt Zach was just so smug and so obnoxious and the thing that I don't get and we might as well break down Zach a bit without like You know when they say if you tattle on someone, you're really telling a tale that you're a tattletale. Okay.	
3	I feel like Zach saying Paul.	
1	He's talking up with car for followers. It's like why is Zach making an enemy of his good long-term friend Cara the season like what's lying with Kyle like a Zach looking for a story line. Other than that? He's a shitty boyfriend.	
3	I'm deprived my couple things though. What is his angle there? Oh, where's that? Where's where's A can car ever like really good friends and I like missing that I didn't didn't work. I think they were friends. Like there was a friend of the middle of them and they were kind of like Friends by association.	
1	You weren't they were I'll tell you because it was one of those things. I wondered that when it sort of came out they weren't necessarily like good friends, but they were sort of Had Each Other's back to the point. Where at some point in dirty 30 or the one after that. It was like someone was trying to get Zach Amanda I think was trying to get Zach to put in car on and whoever her partner. Or was he was like car wouldn't say my name like I have her back and she is sort of an unspoken are at their best friend only sort of we're cool like that where it's like unless there's a need we're cool like we're on the same science. So to turn anywhere, I guess friends. I don't know. I don't know if they were best friends that I know. She's friends with Jeff friends respect. Whatever Had Each Other's backs and for him to turn so completely I Like we can all I think everybody can sort of agree at this point and this might be a wrong taken. I might get a lot of hate for this. I love Cara there that's like my role that everyone agrees with that.	
3	I think everyone might be a little like, I'm not a car fan.	
1	Oh, I've never been a fan or not because I am and even if you're not I know you we can all agree her and Pauly are super annoying.	
3	Oh Knowing I don't dislike her at all. I mean I know but you know again I am not like against her and I'm not necessarily big fan either. I just you know, I think she's a I just went when she came and she was on with us last season. I just thought she didn't like even care if she was taking care like that. She was on of us she was singing background. I don't even like as a person as well. They're eating ice cream. Yeah.	
1	And I think she was like, oh we're here and we're on the Skype, but I don't want to steal her Thunder, but then it just became with and don't be uh, kind of got in the way the whole stuff.	
3	Okay stops. Yeah, he tells it how it is. Is he right about saying that Polly's with Cara for followers? Why is that? I survived that I'm not saying I'd like Zach of with the with his girlfriend thing. I think Jenna is her. Mine is Warped with that and that's awful. But I'm saying I think that I would hang out with Zach and have a beer with him. That's what I'm just I'm just saying Kyle to I'll have a beer with Kyle to David Sachs not funny and you can have a beer with him in five years when he sneaks out and sheets on Jenna who's pregnant, but you're getting my point of I just said that that's awful. I just said it's awful what he's doing Jenna. I'm just saying is he wrong for saying that Polly is trying to get more followers by being with car? Yes. I think I think that's well. Yeah. Yeah. A statement I think is wrong. Yes. Yeah, that's that you're saying the opposite. So I agree with that. I mean, but that's again. It's all opinion. Yeah, I mean and also stated though.	
1	He said this is my exact to get more followers by starting drama with Cara and Paulie and the sidewalk. That's what I'm saying. That's trying to get attention. All of a sudden Zach's never gotten involved in any drama. Now, he's going to take the most popular face of the show couple and sit there and call them out and this is someone who's always been friends with and instead of picking I'm saying now is Zach's trying to get attention Zack and now I This is just occurring to me Zach and Jenna, you know Cameo like Zach's I like don't even follow him, but I can see these like good a cameo for me and Jen. I think Zach's trying to get in the game. Now. He's probably not qualified to do much. Yeah, and now he's trying to get like social media rich.	
3	I know did you say that Zach's never been involved with drama though. You just I thought you just said it's because giving Amanda he's like I'm wittingly then that he starts talking smack.	
1	He doesn't usually go to the house and go.	
3	But man, they really like you said he's over it though. Now you said this he's okay. So maybe he's like I'm gonna start drama because why not?	
1	I think that's exactly and I think Zach's thinking yeah how much more of these I got in me. I'm gonna throw my chips in become a character because I'm not under the radar and I probably known popularly as a schmuck.	
3	We're not together music. We're not saying he's a good boyfriend, but he was telling it how he thought tonight with his opinion and I like I don't believe he thinks cars in love with Kyle.	
1	I think that's something that	
3	For fun, right? That was for fun. Yeah, I'm talking all I said was the in the followers from Paulie. I'm going to talk about Cara I'm saying Polly something to say though to it's like again, it's little he just stirring the pot and it's all a matter of opinion.

1	A sincere relationships I would hope so. Yeah, I would hope so too, but I don't think I really do like call me a fool.	
3	I would not do that.	
1	I I don't I believe it whether it's gonna last or whether you know, regardless of whatever I do believe that they believe that they like each other. All right, you know the say so, all right. So we've got that then let's move on to Bare Bears Antics. So we already sort of covered Bears freak out during the quit and everyone see words and everyone's I'm better than all these people. I can't stand losing to these people. None of them are as good as me. So that was his quitting during the tired and then we get to the tribunal where he's back at it. So him and day come in. She gives a very impassioned sincere. Speech that, you know, we're tied together, but please you know know after she said and after he left, right?	
3	Yeah, so yeah.	
1	So what were some of his Antics he did talk over Ivory female right as Cara pointed out. What did he do? What was the D?	
3	He know you said that she didn't have like the good fashion sense or her clothing was not right. He was clapping back. Everyone is that until 92? Stop flirting with him, which was fun? He's funny. She's not	
1	But obviously that's where I'm like you are playing a character.	
3	This is your gimmick fine if that gimmick is him joking with nany that she's for with him like that gimmicks funny but the other stuff about her fashion sense like okay, what is that and all the other stuff you did? Well, we'll talk about the horny thing that he says to today before the challenge started.	
1	He's just trying to be outrageous and I think that that happens in reality TV, of course, but when you are playing for a million dollars One would think there'd be a modicum of try. Well, there's a certain if you're capable. It was a certain extent auteur.	
3	It becomes obvious. Let me know, you know, yeah. Yeah, what do you got to keep your head in the game? Because at the end of the day do you're going for a million dollars here? Right? I mean is you acting for and TV worth right losing a million dollars. So there's always that of course, but then to it's like there's that line where take okay now, I know it's just too much dude, you know, I mean, it's fashion sense the cart will it's like this because this is a so rare and was it like a barrel?	
1	What kind of side and it's mean because it's really mean for Davon who really wants to try and is kind of you know, it's not like they're terrible. I don't know how they are yet. So I would yeah, they're still in it, right if they're not in it to win it. I understand being in it to become a character and be on more shows. Yeah fine, but don't do that to your partner when you're not necessarily going to be eliminated yet. And you do get paid weekly on the show. So it's like the longer if You don't try and get eliminated.	
3	Think about the name of this episode is the greatest showman and we're all agreeing that that spare right? The greatest showman is someone that's acting as showman is someone that's showing off its not necessarily the truth.	
1	Yes, and it was also funny in that and then when he listens to Kyle so, you know, he's an idiot then Kyle's like they'll go, you know, go do stuff and that's when he jumps on the you here Kylie's and he's telling the camera men to follow me.	
3	Yeah. Stay with you. On your ass like we gotta go follow him. Exactly.	
1	It is funny because Kyle now, I think it Kyle is Kyle's no dummy.	
3	He says he's like, I like I like me some Kyle. I think he's funny. I think he's a man-whore but he's fun.	
1	He's a man-whore but he's Savvy he knows and I think he's playing everyone. He played big dumb Zach as his shield who's going first.	
3	I think he honestly is like life Zach Bowen is like that. Yeah. I don't want he meant for that. I don't think he wanted Zach to go in like that. I don't think he was like, oh thank God. I had my shield with I think it was a plan.	
1	How could I think he did me - I don't think at all. He planned on getting Zack sent home. I think he didn't want people has become Shield.	
3	Yeah, like why wouldn't you know, but you definitely did needs act. Like absolutely that's why I'm upset that Zach went home because I don't do you think that maybe Kyle have to go to West and be like Wes I need somebody on my side like who does he have now?	
1	Well now he's got all the breads now. He's alive with all the breads he is. He's yeah and all and all the vets. Like Maddie, so it's fair pretty and Chic.	
3	He's got he's got Polly coming after him so hard it's almost like Ten teams coming after him because Paulie doesn't care about anybody leaving except for Kyle and just a big Target tunnel vision every time he doesn't he doesn't see anybody else.	
1	Oh, yeah, that's where now it's time to put up or shut up. Like if you want to Kyle keep going like home Sue to my face. Well, then win a challenge Kyle, where do you know again?	
3	Just wanted to eliminate your last week.	
1	He won an elimination. But again, that's almost like	
3	All right, hold on hold on. You know what that episode really pissed me off because know how you did not win you what you got lucky by default because there's two guys taking on CJ CJ demolish both those guys by himself. He got lucky by default and that frustrated because when I saw CT go home like dude, you should not be going home. He's literally taking on two guys by himself and like man Kyle no offense dude, you seem cool. But if that was what I 1C to crush a hundred percent for either of them he hung on though.	
1	He he did win but Sometimes there's a if you're someone that always wins if you win once now that's incomes. Not terrible. I'm not saying I'm not saying Kyle's not good, right, but there's consistent people that always win. He's a real Hit or Miss. Sometimes he can win.	
3	Sometimes he totally won't win depending on but he's never left the challenge super early yet because he plays a fantastic game and that's what it's about really overall. It's about being it's about having all the things having good averages on everything whether it be politics whether it be the Challenges or the eliminations being pretty good at all.	
1	But he needed a Zack Zack is like fiercely loyal to these guys as we saw when he threw away his chance in a million dollars. They need someone else Kyle needed Cara in the first time he was on there and now we need exact so that for his for that side of the alliance like now in terms of a champion, that's not going to throw them in someone that can consistently get on the tribunal at that you're safe with because the Brits he might be safe with but it It seems like there's some consistent teams were seeing on the tribunal and they don't seem to be the ones where the Brits are ruling the vote.	
3	Yeah, so I think we should get was good to be what elimination do it?	
1	Yeah Killing Floor. So we have up for the vote Yes. We got z&z bear bear and day and then the throwaway Jen and Gatlin jenga's right so we know We know that it basically what did you think of the voting process where you surprised at how it went down It ultimately wound up being z&z that were seconds Akita that were selected to go in. Did you see that coming?	
3	Yeah, I didn't I they were playing it up that bear thing so much that I was like knapsack is here gonna go in. Yeah, but you go ahead. No, I'm like 90% agree. I think it was pretty obvious is exactly one in.	
1	Yeah, they mean they did drag it out where I was like God are they gonna and then the funniest thing happened when they	
3	when Zach and CT were trying to decide who they wanted. We all looked at each other when they said Wesson D and we were like, oh no don't do that. What are you thinking and then they did it and we're like, okay we bet we watched what happened, but we were like Wes Indira win this yeah. Oh, well, I got a conspiracy corn. I love it. I don't have one right now.	
1	This is further support for my feelings of Zach's just like go out with a bang. I'm over this. They had so much of a better chance beating Josh and Amanda Josh and Amanda. Maybe maybe even Wes and Georgia country in Georgia Hunter and Georgia get wasn't D. It's like I don't I think dear is so strong Baron Devon with them like literally any team.	
3	Any other team would have been Barren devot, right?	
1	Like he has no relationship with why not Leroy and his	
3	Because we've seen that that his partner. I can't even think of her name. Isn't that great so far. She hasn't shown approvers proved herself yet.	
1	I think he's probably friends with Leroy and didn't want to call him out. That's true. But there are people there were many people that there weren't really dramatic. I know Barons a heat up, but it's like you're gonna up there's a bread on every team. Like one of them is going to have to they're gonna have to break eventually this way too many of them and picking D and Wes over Josh and Amanda who are basically a layup.	
3	Here's a here's my thing, too. Amanda in him have such a history. Wouldn't you want to just take her out? Yes. Yeah in a clinic in elimination. Like why not?	
1	I would love to see the outtakes from this episode where where and Zack and Amanda decided to Ally against Cara didn't it wasn't Josh not able to finish that puzzle in the first episode.	
3	We didn't know it was a puzzle on the killing.	
1	We didn't know what it was going to be but are those two boxes?	
3	I already set up because then they might know like we're going to be something in a box. There's probably a puzzle box neighbor set up but no man, you're right now, but yeah, so Josh overall Josh and Amanda they need to prove themselves. I think they should be yeah.	
1	Yeah, so they decide to go with Wes and d and Wes again proving why he is always thinking I really thought that line the the wise West wisdom was Was these Brits look dumb and act dumb but they are not dumb and that sums up Kyle perfectly to like he played me so hard that person. I thought he was a big dumb lovable fun. I got no, he's so lovable and fun. Technically.	
3	I actually now we just know his game, you know, he's more last season. He was awful to every but this season he's been kind of fun so far. Well, he's been distracted because of poly so he hasn't really had much time to be stupid. You know, he said so He said a lot of dumb stuff last episode, but it was so it but see that's think bear said dumb stuff this episode and I hated it at least when Kyle was saying dumb stuff last episode. I was entertained what kind of why am I watching this show a little more clever than bad.	
1	I mean Kyle has good commentary and go decides where as Bears just saying ridiculous things and then going back on them when it was his sort of outtakes when he thinks they might vote for him. It's like, please please please. I'm sorry. I beg you, please please please. I love you, but your best friend and it's like come on stick to your guns. At least be like, I'll take you.	
3	Doubt if you're gonna Rollo through with that character, maybe maybe bear maybe bear Had a Bad episode maybe he's gonna come around next episode is going to be hilarious. So himself, maybe I maybe I don't know every episode Anything could happen every episode.	
1	Yeah, NOS.	
3	Yeah. Yeah. So what'd you think of the lights out? But Jessica lights out? Yes. Yes.	
1	No did West dominated so completely that it was amazing. I love D. So so basically breakdown super quick of this is you Our in this dark room putting together a sort of tetris-like puzzle that has different shapes and then TJ is out there turning off the lights periodically. So you're completely in the dark and one teammate needs to go RI flip on the light switch. So it's sort of running puzzle solving and teamwork.	
3	Yeah a little running they switched off on the runs to which I thought they both did. I thought that just I don't know. I for some reason I thought that Wes was going to run every time because I thought he thought D was better with this particular puzzle D was like in the zone. Yes. You looked at me. Well how like I was like, wow, I can't let you do this. She's like, oh, yeah. I liked it better when the lights were off because I have to worry about the color. I'm like, I would have been just I don't know what to do that. The colors are distracted. Yeah dealing with shake my parents and she was just like bam bam bam. Yeah. Yeah to backtrack just a little bit, huh, right before that started. I did like d and Wes because I like just like against CT last time once they were called you see that switch map. That's which literally switches called same thing that I liked about D. It was just like, okay. It's on no. It's like here we go. And once I saw it, I was like yes because Wes is back and that's what I like to see Ryan. I think D is a pretty damn equal partner with him as she kicks but you know and she turned it on and I think she may be performed better than West on this. Oh definitely but together they did very well at first I got to be honest. I thought the challenge that I didn't really get at first. I was like, wait what you got to like run and do a puzzle. I didn't get it and then once it's all cut the lights off and then they got wrong was like, okay, that's why she cut out that's hard like the endurance. You gotta run run directly back put the puzzle. Like I was like, yeah, so this this okay.	
1	Yeah and you have to be really quick because you're sort of Shifting mental tasks.	
3	Yeah rapidly like run puzzled Dark Run puzzle dark the teamwork and the heat explained what her and Zach were doing they were working for the outsides and working in I'm like, um, I my strategy would be to work start on one side and finish it one way not a jigsaw puzzle. We're building a kitten like right. I just don't think Zach's ever been good at puzzles, really and I don't we don't know enough about so he did a really I know that so I was going and I for for some something about D. I can just tell she is so damn witty up here. Oh, yeah, and she's obviously super athletic and she's strong. I'm telling you this team really good. That's what I'm going to say. I love me some D and west from now on instead of I love me some West Indies because that sounds weird.	
1	Right? Do you know what they are team? I and I love zahira. I wish we got to see more of her. Unfortunately. He's tied does that	
3	I love me some Zahida. She's so cute. She's really cute. I love her accent. She's so cute. She's so fun. And I honestly thought with that that elimination or challenge they had before with the with the map. I thought her and Zach really worked. Well Jim I love her team work on that was busy. He is good. I like this. Yeah. Yeah. She definitely would be good. We want to see her back for sure. And I think she could actually turn out to be a good competitor. Now.	
1	Let's talk about the teams that are currently falling super under the radar. And shed some light on them because there's so many people that I'm like, oh, right what's going on with can action cam is what I wish that they had showed the rest of the challenge play out to some extent so we could have seen where everyone else was. We have no idea because it's just like those three one and we have no idea because that was hard and if there were some people close behind those are people to watch out for yeah, so I would have liked to have seen At yeah, Leroy and I do not remember his partner's name.	
3	I don't know. What is her. She's a lovely girl. I'm sure I don't I don't remember her name.	
1	I don't remember the radar.	
3	That's all under the radar. She is we don't even remember the name.	
1	It does go to show that when you're not fighting with a car or a bananas even Amanda as insane or a stupid lavender lady. Yeah, you can fly out. She's flying under the radar tube right now to like when they've got a bigger enemy.	
3	Yeah, Amanda's just If I'm Hunter after his performance today, I'm on that treadmill every morning just running. I don't want to see you Hunter. I don't want to see you lifting know. I love you, honey, but I want to see lifting no more weights. I want to see on the cardio do an elliptical if it's bad on your knees on that treadmill. I don't care no more weightlifting just run because then you'll be good. She um his partner who's super cute to what's Georgia, Georgia her endurance was off the chart here. Yeah. No problem. I think 200 just had an off day man. He's better than I he's so much as sat in Tire David yet doesn't mean you got it.	
1	I've seen your teen of them in round one.	
3	He was like, I've seen him perform. That was as much his exact noise. Yeah, I'm gonna give him this one. I give you this one man, but you have hard dude, you've performed so much better and like I think crazy challenges and I'm gonna let you slide on that is why we're calling him out because it's so uncharacteristic of him.	
1	He's usually like the Terminator. He doesn't back down. I'm actually anxious to hear Hunter sir. Of response to tonight because has he ever now I'm like is he bad at endurance? But I feel like she's got into fight like he's never performed this poorly and I said, we don't know who knows what happened the night before maybe he I don't know strange that he was so bad at this or did so poorly and she we should get him on for the phone in here.	
3	I bet he would have any come back home with us.	
1	Okay. We'll talk to him about this last week. Maybe he knows something. We don't know that's curious to find out Hunter. We want to know and part 2. That hundred not doing good with other teams under the radar under the radar. No Hunter. Oh also Hunter. Yeah. I love Hunter and don't like Ashley and was a hundred percent ready to blame the constant bickering on her. Okay, but I don't want to see as West said, why is Wes wise when are you with your target with your partner during a competition and I do think Hunter knows better than that.	
3	He took responsibility in the confessional when he was just talking when he's a talking head. He was like, yeah. He's like I What she's mad and drives his my best thing, but the way he was acting towards Georgia. It's like right it was more out of like he's like damn George's kicking my butt. Like she's the better competitor today. I can't even keep up with my own partner. I think that's where his frustration right? He didn't get eaten quit like bear. So it is what it is since when is is hundred?	
1	That's what I'm saying. He started the challenge before they even started going and I'm not good at this like since when you don't crazy stuff I was dragging himself with a broken wrist across like a high.	
3	How far was that run from the tire area to the building the tire area. Was it in fire? Was it that far? I mean honestly who know we're not here but it seemed like it could be it looked like a good distance but not something where it's like but I mean I got to tell you man. So, you know, if you ever feel too tired or deadlifts, I mean that it's like the only imagine yeah, it's endurance. It's draining why not roll so Pam to rise with rollers and even like rolling those still if it's heavy. I mean then you're trying to hurry and I wonder how deep that like how how soft that sand was if it really went down.	
1	Sand and Manhattan - would be Which Way They carried it maybe must those hairs must have been so heavy for them to be able to climb up 14 of them like think about that the fact that they could hold their weight climbing up 14 of them as I got more and more narrow means they're pretty huh.	
3	Like I mean, I would rather let me say this though feel literally just for the last one was like putting a star on top of Christmas tree like that blah. So I mean he what Zach said about him like the car being teamed up with Olympian. That's the truth because guess what he's Olympian and he's tall as F personal challenge. So I don't think the only reason that's the only reason you're here is because and it's like no Karma Spirit just make he was definitely frustrating just making it a point, but she is with an Olympian and and that definitely helped because the putting those last couple tires on if you didn't literally stand on each other's shoulders or be six foot eight like Theo that game wasn't anything look at a poly. Lee and ninja Natalie Polly's what 5/4 and he managed he waited a little he just climbed up that he just climbed up the tires didn't even know he was there. It's tough. It's tough all around again. It's I think it's one of those challenges were it's like it's a matter of strength and endurance and we're not talking about Polly. He is kicking this challenge here this entire time. I'm not a poly fan, but he's just he's winning at my lab. I like Polly. I like pulling I like him even more now because I'm seeing him more and more as a competitor like kick butt and I'm seeing He's actually capable of my God. This this is a good competitor. So I let me tell you why I don't like Polly. Why don't you like Polly just just for fun right now? One one thinks one thing tonight though. He's bradying cars hair turn the elimination Paulie and I understand that cameras are trying to catch weird stuff like that. But he must have been doing that for quite a long time for the camera do like, all right, let's show them grating car is hair before the elimination Dan. You want Brady ladies here? Of course, everybody's here on national TV, and it's not going to be car that I'm dating. So sure. I don't mind. You're right. I guess I would but am I doing it on national TV before an elimination what I'm supposed to be like I wonder who's going to win this he's just he's not even looking down. There's like man. I love her. I love that red dragon hair.	
1	They're very weird. There's something very strange about them. Whatever having said that if we lived in a vacuum if I unzipped the bag that I lived in every week and just watch The Challenge I would love Polly and car like if I didn't witness anything else I would just say and it's few lies. Everyone attacking these poor good competitors.	
3	Like why are they use too much for me at this point, but I think that's one of the things I was telling you that no one's ever gonna agree. Some people got to love them and some people gonna hate him exactly.
