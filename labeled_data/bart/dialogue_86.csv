3	Good morning, everyone. This is a podcast about me and Ash. My name is Jen. I'm Ashley and we are going to be talking about attempting the life of Living the proverbs 31 wife. Needless to say we fail every day, but we continue to keep on working at it. Yep. That's right. So, how's your week been Ash? So it's been great tells your weakened State. That's real life right there. How's your week been? It's been pretty good work kids husband, you know, but the balance yeah. His balance completely a balance because life can get tough can get overwhelming and you're working every day. Then you're having to take care of kids and you've got kids going in different directions and you haven't take care of yourself. And it's just I mean, it's a lot. I think I have like Mount Everest and one of my rooms of laundry that just tell me. Okay speaking of laundry the other night when I got home at about eight o'clock, I would there was a load in the washer machine may be true. Transferred over to the dryer and so because I'm short I have to reach over and do multiple trips from the washing machine to the dryer and I turn the dryer on. Well, there was some little dirt that sprinkled onto the ground in front of the dryer. So I knelt down to sweep it up and I kept hearing Thump Thump Thump and I thought oh my God, that's fabric softener ball is in the dryer. I open the dryer. Guess what? I see my poor baby, Cork City. Staring at me and I just snatched her out of there and I was sobbing uncontrollably and check came over to check on us and she was fine. She only did three tumble, but my heart was exploding you put your cat in the dryer. She jumped in there. I mean come on, I'm gonna happen. I have no idea get it together. I know what we don't have it together. No, no, that's okay, but that that invert talking about That I mean I want I love you know, I love my husband. Nick is awesome. But in talking about that, we just talked about yesterday and expectations. You know, I'm reading how to be a help me and I'm trying to really get into proverbs 31 and being a great wife and a mother and so I'm just, you know preparing the day like I know what time he's going to come home because he's working out of town and they have this great dinner fixed and the house is clean and you're awesome. And it was just you know, I was so proud of myself. Like I needed like the badge right yesterday, right? Well apparently in the midst of me taking the pork loin out of the oven Nick came home. No excitement. You know, he just rolled his suitcase into the bedroom and and I went back there and I'm like your home. He's like, yeah, I've been here for like 30 minutes sarcastically. Yeah, really not been there for 30 minutes, but that's just how we are picking at each other and I acted like a two-year-old because he was not like Overwhelmingly, you know, I needed something like some balloon, right? All right yesterday fetty. Yeah, because I had just fixed this great meal and I had the house clean and he came home to it. I thought that he had just won the lottery and he just thought he just came home. Like that's the way it was supposed to be. So when he pops down in the recliner I go in there and I'm like well dinner's ready but such a non-Christian attitude and I passed out and I'm like, you know what this whole wife thing. And being this proverbs 31, I'm over it. I'm done. I'm going to bed I have attempted and I have failed and all I could say was I'm sorry. I didn't give you the reaction that you wanted and I think us is ladies or women wives mothers. I think that we work so hard at things we're expecting a reaction. We don't get that reaction. We feel some sort of defeat, but that's not what it's about. Right? Like, I mean, it needs called to be that way right hardly regardless and the reaction and it really needs to be You know, we need to think why are we doing this? Are we doing the what are our motive? Right like are we doing this? Because it's what we've been called to do and doing it without any expectations because really that's what we should be doing. Right and it's hard. It's very difficult, but you just have to pray and you have to and that's easier said than done I struggle with it, but when I start Gravitating towards those negative thoughts or getting upset with chat because he didn't do something the way I thought he should have done or didn't react a certain way. I try to in that moment. Pray pray for God to redirect my focus back on him. Right and I think that in people that are listening to this. I mean if you know us then, you know, are you I mean if you really know us and you know our life story and you know things that we've been through we're not going to get on that the first episode of course because that would take us like, Yeah so much and some tissues and ice cream and all that but you know, my bad, yeah our marriages, you know have not been perfect. And so please by all means don't think that we are living this, you know, perfect lie for you as you can hear we're not but our marriage is a daily a daily thing that we work on that we have here recently. God is really tugged at my heart amount even though we've been married almost 19 years 20 years. And we have grown kids. It's just been really late on my heart recently that it is not about I mean, this is not about him necessarily. It's about me and my walk with Christ and what I'm called to do regardless of what everyone else is doing around me. Like I don't have to do it just like so, you know Susie Joe does it because I'm not ever going to get it like Susie Joe. Apparently I've tried and it just doesn't work. You just have to be real right and and we at the end of the day. Only person that we can answer for to God is ourselves how strong we can't control Leathers, right? We can't all we can control is our actions and reactions. Right and my reactions are just I mean, they're not good sometimes so, you know, I'm always there for the laughs. I'm a I do not do it. You know. I'm just I'm just real person. Yeah, and I think that's the biggest thing with right now with women with teenage girls in particular. We just can't be Real why can't I just need to be you be respectful of others but be you and Don apologize right for yourself, like all the aren't taste don't be burnt taste. And by the way, if you haven't read that book, it's by Teri Hatcher. It's called burnt taste awesome. Pick it up at the bookstore. I'm sure you can get it on Amazon, but don't apologize for things that you haven't done wrong because your car is dirty or your house is a mess. Who cares. Invite like if Ash were to show up at my door come in cat hair baby everywhere cat maybe in the dryer, but she is always welcome anytime day or night unlike me of gin comes through the door. It's like have you seen that guy that does those videos of the crazy moms when companies coming over back in the pillows up the covers that is good and do the train. That's right. You just pick one out all out. I'm like, hold on just a minute. Give me five but you can't be that way because that's not real and if we're really going to be real people. I myself have got to let go of that just the expectation of trying to be perfect because we are not we will never be perfect when I it doesn't exist. That's right. Because if we were perfect then why would you know, why would God have sent his son to die for our sins? There would be no reason that we would need his his grace and his mercy and he gives it to us. Single day, we've got to give it to ourselves as well. Yeah, and we and you know, that's something that and each other. That's right. That's right. So, you know, I mean just be real I mean just every day all day real now and if you want to us to talk about something, I mean, I know this is our first time doing a podcast and we've really been talking about it for a while now, but you want to talk about something tell us let us know somehow reach out to us. We're on Instagram. We're on Facebook. I mean, just let us know. Know what you want to talk about and we'll be happy to talk about it. Now, you know, we're not always going to agree on every fright because we're real people. Yeah, but that's real life and we're just living it. So if you see our picture today on Instagram, I just give you a little back story about me and Jen so we've been friends for like how long now 10 years at least. Yes. So in 10 years of friendship, you would think that we would know each other but now right I should know that when Jen says do you want to meet every Saturday morning for coffee? The Cornerstone coffee place and I'm like, yes, and by the way, you should go there. If you've not gone Ross done every Saturday morning and Eclectic, Alabama. Yes. It is amazing. Love it love the atmosphere. But you know she wants to meet she's like, oh, it doesn't matter what you have on just wear your leggings t-shirt ball cap. No makeup. I'm going just like no fool. Relax. Yes. I don't remember any time that Jen has showed up in the ball cap and t-shirt and leggings with no makeup. Okay, so she shows up but you know, oh the the oversized sweater and the hoop earrings the makeup and the hairs fix cute little denim shorts. And then and I'm in my t-shirt ball cap. No makeup. I have followed the rules and the rule follower did not follow the rules. I'm always cold every room at the sweater is not dressy but it is the cutest one from the boutique that you found them and last weekend. I showed up in a in a hoodie sweatshirt. Eddie sweatshirt. Yeah what it's not and she didn't sure so that's okay because next Saturday, I'm going out for some I'm gonna curl my hair done my makeup. I'm going to look like we are going out on the town and I hope you come looking like a bum. I love you. Anyway, you are obviously you have to just love me just the way that I am. I mean I am who I am, we're not Our one thing about Jin and I think our friendship is so strong because we are who we are and we just it's not to sound ugly or rude or anything but you know fake it's just it's just fake. That's just what happens and we just we don't do things. That's right. We can't we can't be around fake because we're not saying we're not we can't even attempt to be fake like we would fail at being fake because rice just gonna act but now I just Oh my goodness. I've watched the show and I can't remember the name of it. There's this lady that if she was living this marriage or whatever and she married to this guy for about four years and they had two kids and every night when he would lay down to go to sleep. She would get up put her hair in rollers and put her night cream on and this this show is set from like the 50's so somebody may not know what I'm talking about, but only watched a couple episodes and then she would raise the blinds just enough so that in the morning when the sun came up she would catch it first and he would go her hair down take her night cream off fix her makeup and lay back down in the bed so that when her husband rolled over and looked at her he would think oh, she's beautiful and she goes to sleep beautiful when she wakes up. Well, I think they've remade that or did something similar and it's called Napoli ever after. Yeah, but not it's hilarious. It's so good. I'm not that person and she learns not to be I'm telling you if I saw someone no sleep asleep exactly. I don't care. Ask that's right retainer. That's right. I mean mouthguard. Yeah. I mean we haven't gotten to like the CPAP machine. No, but I mean, but if we did is a - I don't have time for that who is getting up in the middle of the night and I don't care chat Stewart expected us a man. And when we're all over they do not look like that. You know, it's like he is beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, they're beautiful. There's a beautiful beautiful. I'm telling you, you know, I mean, it's just as precious every moment is precious. Yes, but we're not doing that. So now and stop doing that if you don't beat yourself up don't break yourself down don't apologize for who you are you matter. That's right be yourself be who you are. And when you start to love yourself people are going to you're just going to see that people will love you. They're drawn to use right because you love who you are and you know, Are in Christ when you are confident in who you are in Christ things make sense, right? And your you have to remember and I have struggled from with this myself my whole life, but you have to find your joy in Christ alone, but you can't find it in a person and your children and a husband in a cat nothing in clothes and food and you can be busy busy busy work work work to try to take your mind off of it, but at the end of of the day Your joy is in Christ alone. And that is it done is right. That's her true happiness is found. So I think we'll dig in more, you know, as we do more podcast. We'll talk about our marriages and what we've been through, you know, apparently there's been a lot, you know that we've gone through in our marriages and we won't go into details but where we are now is where I pray that God continues to keep me in that place of wanting to Live the life that you know, he's called me to live He's commanded. Yeah, he's not only called us but I ended us and once he has you know, that promise that he has made to us. I mean, it's not that life is going to be easy. Yeah, it's not I mean it's like have you ever seen the video with the guy? I can't remember the movie but he's rolling down the hill. I posted that on Facebook like a hundred times like this is me and I'm getting at the end of it. I'm like what the crap was that? Yeah, that's me every day. I got my heel trying to hang on to it. Branch, and yeah, I'm down a little bit more when I get back up it does. Yeah, let's go. Yeah, so you just keep fighting. That's right. No matter what keep fighting in your marriage keep fighting in your friendships. Keep fighting at your job. Do not let anyone tell you or make you think that you're less. Yeah, and that you have to quit or that something's got to be better than what you have because it's not it's not nice and it's not worth it now so fight for what you've God purposely placed it there for you and your life for a reason and you know, what what I have learned is that you will End up where God wanted you to be and where he you know places you and you can do it in his time or you can do things. Like I've done things my whole life Jen's way and I could have avoided not all the heartache but most of the heartache if I would have just listened if I would have prayed if I would have truly seeked him and his well for ya what? Yes, thank you English. If I would have salt him and prayed and truly. Listen, right, but sometimes we do that so I've tried to tell my kids that you know that they're all like helicopter Mom all this but but there's two ways either you're gonna because we're we've been called by Christ we have that call, right? Okay, so and I firmly believe that like, I've I believe in his promises and the convictions are there I know but there are ways you there's two streets you can either go with him. No, it's not going to be perfect and it's not going to be easy. They're going to be bumps in the road. But would you rather have him holding your hand or be out there on your Own. Mmm. I mean that's him for sure. Oh my goodness. Like I can't do it damn, you know, I mean and that we weren't called to live a life without him. We were called to live life with him and through him and when you do that man, it just makes you want the you can laugh about the things that happened like putting the cat in the dryer. Yeah, you know, you just, you know still Flora how that big fur ball did not appear to you that she was in the dryer, but that's okay because I mean, you know like My cat has been picked up five times and taken to the Humane shelter because she is just ate it she escapes and she goes over to First Baptist and she plays with her friends and people think she's Homeless Cat and I have to go back and get her and they don't understand that. I do put a collar on her because she takes it off and leaves it at the front door because she is a rebellious child. Yeah, so, you know life is life. Just laughs. Yeah live it roll with the punches right be learning from your mistakes and and and trust God. Always well put yeah, well it was right. It was nice everyone. We hope yeah real hope you guys enjoyed it will be posting another here's soon. So be watching out for us yet. Have a great day. Hi, Tom.
