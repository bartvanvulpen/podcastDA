That's a that's probably good but don't forget to subscribe to both of them because you're going to need us both at different times during your planning. Absolutely. So, um, I'm just gonna let Rebecca take the reins completely today. She's like she's so good. She wrote it all out. We got the e-mail this week last week the poor thing. She sent the email and it didn't come through. So we were winging it and on top of that. I had deleted my main job of my you deleted the content a deleted it. So it's gone. It's gone that Coco shows lost. How did you even manage to tell you that? I don't know. That's I've given up trying I spent an hour trying to figure it out. And I don't know what I did you like it's officially a takeover girton is over then rewriting it.	
1	Yes, it's you guys hadn't mentioned that that happened. I would never would have known I would have just been like this. It's a really interesting episode where they go through this entire Facebook thread that Lisa started and I was reading there anyway, yeah, irony.	
2	Yeah, like it just happened to be conveniently placed and it was just going to be like chopped up more. That's all. Yeah. Yeah, it was a little and this	
1	Stories from that group is right.	
2	Yeah. I was like, oh the crap. I'm blessed with today. It's perfect. So you guys being professional photographers and all videography as well. You had a very interesting story you shared you probably know which one I'm talking about, but I wanted you to tell our listeners as well. They can come over and hear your gut a little more of your guys take on it you started off talking about Out the very generous offer a photographer received as payment. So can you guys share that story with us?	
1	Yes, so I was listening to another podcast called. I don't give an f stop. It's another wedding photography podcast / live video show and they were talking about a story they found on Facebook where a photographer did a shoot for a couple and then the couple wanted them to come back and do family photos later like a year or two later and said, hey the husband symptoms are Give her a message and said hey my wife and I both think that you are very attractive maybe in payment for the family photos. We could work out an arrangement if you know what I mean.	
2	Awesome and what do we know where that went? Look what happened? So they did it obviously who wouldn't right.	
1	I believe what ended up happening was the photographer. For new like the some of the family members of the guy who approached her and like reached out to like his mom or his aunt or something like that and just let them know that's cold.	
2	I feel like those and doing this and that is yeah.	
1	I'm actually quite disappointed and this photographer. Well, I mean this photographer was solicited or was asked to solicit people for Solution I'm not really certain how that goes. Yeah, I mean basically trade work for us.	
2	And then John I have the sex worker quite yet. He must have had a golden rod like for real. Oh man didn't think it was it was worth a lot and I'm in a way I was a little surprised because either way you said it it was I don't know. It sounded to me like, oh it was like a male and female approaching a male. But of course it was a female. Of course it was. That's a silly thing for sure.	
1	And of course it resume lower pressure.	
2	Awesome. So in case you guys don't know listening to the show, don't do that. It's not advisable. Well, I mean no no in a business trip Becca. I just wanted to eat that way. You guys can cut y'all can come she's down today. I would I just say Is this entering I would like to use get an inbox evil that Rebecca for trade barter it that's some barter is barter some dick like I don't know dick for pics.	
1	I imagine you would be sitting behind my email thinking Hmm. Should I I would have a right angle story is how serious content but it's true, but you need you would need them to sign. Sound like a dick pic first to know busy worth your time.	
2	Right please no, no dick pics should never ever be so I agree my question about Dick Pics. Can I ask you something just ya know especially as we have a male here, these are conversations. I don't know nothin your wife's here. I'm not going to ask you anything too bad about you.	
1	Can this question though? It doesn't bother me. Okay.	
2	I never experienced a dick pic phenomenon. Thank God because I Area before all this stuff started to really explode a social media and Snapchat and all that crap. How do you like it? How do you know the size though? Really if it's close enough? There's really no scale. Like do you put a dime in the picture? So you really know how large the dick is I know the answer to this but I'll let Stephen go do you put like a soda can next to it and just be like one and a half. Dr. Peppers high. Is that like what we do?	
1	I mean, wow, I like to just get out a tape measurer and just you know show in inches exactly how it is. Like yeah, but you have to find a novelty tape measurer that you know shows everything real real small.	
2	Oh, yes. Of course. I was going to say I'm a girth wrap the tape measure around listen, you know, it would suck is if it's snapped back and caught you you deserve	
1	If you're taking dick pics, you deserve it you do.	
2	You know what I think is accurate for measuring girth what toilet paper toilet paper roll. That's yeah. Everybody knows the window very true. It's true or you can if it's inside. Oh no list. I mean really, I think you go back to the dr. Pepper can so you can use it from two angles and you take a picture from the side for height and you take one from above for girth. Now if you Google or have ever seen people that have been sent dick pics they post them sometimes right? Okay. I didn't Google that and I don't want to I did. Yeah people. Yeah, they put like water bottles can do yes. Oh my God, I just made that up. Yeah. I'm so smart. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Just thank you. I just wanted to know if my hunch was correct.	
1	I have I'm going to make a confession. I've only ever taken one dick pic in my entire life. Was for Jen. I don't remember this. I meant of dungeon sent to you through snapchat. Oh, oh my gosh. Oh, yeah. I meant for Dustin antigen through Snapchat and we both felt terrible about it afterwards. It was something she had said, hey, why don't we try that? Maybe that would be fun getting very very personal.	
2	That's okay. It's what we do. Congratulations to you though for like trying to step out of that box a little bit.	
1	Right keep things interesting and we decided it's not for us. Yeah, it's really not for me.	
2	I asked why Snapchat like did you use a funny face filter or something?	
1	We you can draw I didn't want I didn't want it to be saved anywhere. That's why Snapchat open SnapChat person to person and that was it. Yeah, it was Batman day like right like when our kids before kids were bored. Yeah. Yeah have iPhones before m is born. It's a possibility that we are sitting right beside each other to it was like, oh carry a curiosity.	
2	So this you know, You could have just looked over our proudest moment, you know, but that's okay. It doesn't have more fun. It was a different angle. So that's true.	
1	You know what has love angle.	
2	It really is like a hundred and eighty degrees difference than anything. You'd normally see right? Oh my God excited.	
1	So we tend to attract this kind of conversation. I don't know why but it always ends up happening, but we can move on to something else that you know, I think we'll just keep talking about this. How long have you guys been married 10 years 11 and August nice. Yep. Hey you remembered it's crazy.	
2	Ah, ah, I'm a what am I? I'm 10 in September. So we're on the same you you beat us all four. Becca married 17 with my husband 420. Yes. Amazing. Yeah, I'm old. What's the snow Secret? You know what? The secret is people shouldn't have such high expectations. I like it. So truly truly when your expectations are too high they're often unmet. So yeah, take it easy. Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone has their faults guys lower that bar. Yep. Willow limboing low. Do you know what the secret is? I still get a back massage every morning every morning for 20 years.	
1	You're coming out over here. I can't hear anything. You're saying. Oh, yeah. Jennifer can oh, yes, I can but you know what he does is he brings me breakfast every once in a while see, you know, it's the little thing straight.	
2	Of course, it'll thinks and what do I do? Yeah, Steven, you're awfully quiet.	
1	I think the question is what don't you do General every morning I wake up to Act that is my wife. So.	
2	Well played well played so we have we have some more news. Yes in the news today. Oh, you guys are part of our in the news, of course because why not did you so Lisa did you saw this? Right? Yes, I did actually, although I didn't watch the video as usual. I see a headline I go. Oh that's interesting. And then I'd like Rebecca will tell me later. So did you get you guys must have seen it it's where the bride is left in shock after their Grooms ex-girlfriend crash. Your wedding wearing a bridal gown and begs him to go back to her. Oh my gosh. Yes, so that just popped up recently and it was it was it was a huge thing Jen. Did you see this as well?	
1	So it was I did not I could not get into that. It was cringeworthy. Just seeing the photo with the headline. Yeah, I could not watch it because I just was like, 'I there's no situation where this is good.	
2	So I fully admit. It I jumped the gun on that one when it first release and I said this is just looks so fabricated. Like I didn't even believe it and then the best I guess what it's real.	
1	Oh my gosh.	
2	It's so yeah the Daily Mail did a whole piece on it and they went into further detail and translated what the MC was saying unlike what MC is gonna be talking through this whole scenario because it was in Chinese. Yeah, right. Yeah. I know. So it was It was kind of Easy and apparently the MC was shocked by it all of it. And he even Ted said we have an unexpected situation here understatement of the century and then added perhaps this is the reality of love. I can't even look how he pulled that out of his ass. I don't know perhaps this is the reality of love. The MCs in attempt to you know, Salvage the wedding. Wow, the quoted a famous Chinese proverb if you ask life what love is it is to devote your life to someone else look well done. Well, okay Bravo. I'm actually gonna make it less awkward. That's all I'm hiring that guy in case something happens like that on my wedding. He's gonna know how to handle it. He's going well, at least he's got a story now you like I can handle anything. And guess what happened last time? Yeah. Yeah exactly, right? Yeah. Next up is the big boob Brigade. Yeah. So this this one is in the news. It's funny just being a thank you to title it like that. Can I just say thank you for doing half my work this week on naming the episode. I really do appreciate it because I always have to think up stuff and it always has a literation always the Big Boo Brigade. This is in the news because all I've seen the past week are This Woman's boobs, but it went a step further and this bride found out yikes. She saw her photos in wedding shaming group and commented thanks cunts. Whoever chose to go through my photos get a fucking life. Let's segue this into a bit of a question. Would you tell your friend sister? Mom Etc that their dress was ill-fitting and further as a photographer. What are you doing with this hot mess? No comments are falling out and the first like Run for the hills. I'm not talking so you guys saw this, right? Yes. Okay good.	
1	It's we many bad situations like this before and I've heard other vendors comment. I mean, maybe not that extreme but other vendors comment like why didn't her mom say anything to hurt like, I mean, she was very classy wedding, but the it was maybe a little too much boob.	
2	Yeah, but	
1	I mean, was it a try to judge maybe if I had those jugs like I would have a nice little spill over to I don't know.	
2	What would you like to that know? I have those jugs. I'm not trusting that shit.	
1	Okay. I've got it to tell you guys a little secret. That's not going to be a secret anymore. Are you going to tell them your cup size? What's going on? No my God, that is not a secret gladly gladly talk about that did not like like my chest showing in my dress. We had a very like very conservative friends and I was afraid that they were going to judge me if I had but it seems like any kind of cleavage showing in my dress. I might have duct-taped my boobs down my on my wedding day.	
2	Ah, so I was the opposite did you come and duct tape my boobs, but it was making me go higher not lower.	
1	Yeah. That's usually the dress I think so. I think if we would when we do that Valerie know I'm going to have like the most cleavage possible duct tape the other baby out for everybody. It's gonna it's literally just going to be nipple tassels and that's it.	
2	I do swirl swirl swirl will be good. It'll be good swirl to the right for yes. And if you go the wrong way though, I bet ya what happens if You get one going one way and one going the other way. It's called palette good talent and Steven gets dizzy and falls down. He's hypnotized. I'm G very nice thing about how great that would be for me.	
1	So okay. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Okay. Hi, so do so.	
2	So you you guys that's it. You're just photographing it as is then well, what can you say at that point? I would say oh, You know, it looks a little lopsided truck pulling it up. Just a little bit o they are they tried.	
1	Excuse me precious your tits are lopsided right now.	
2	Oh my God, I kid you not. Okay, then it wasn't because they were spilling out but I've said two Brides yet. You're looking a little off there like she ate it. I appreciate that like thank you for telling me.	
1	I feel like the three of you could say something.	
2	I was just about to say that if I	
1	I said something. I feel like they'll be like why are you looking at my breasts and I'd be like a job and then I'd be done and then walk away. You know, I will say this when I was a bridesmaids a bridesmaid in a wedding. I was fixing my chest before the photo started and the male photographer said stop touching your boobs. Oh jeez. I was like dude, it wasn't like I and then ever since that I'm like that guy that got me. You know what I think if it was a female photographer, I would be like, okay not that big of a deal but Yeah, I'm just like shut up.	
2	I understand. I'm applying my tassel. Shut up.	
1	I yeah fine line for the dude hard thing that yeah, I think it's a hard thing for the guys. Okay. So here's a situation if the bride's boobs were a little off if I if there's a way to fix that to make it look better. Yeah, I will probably wouldn't have a problem to the as a professional to say something about that. I just do it discreetly right like absolutely like hey. Hey, sweetheart, like I let's go look in the mirror and see if we can get like everything looking great and they're like, I don't know like just don't do it in front of a bunch of people. You don't want to embarrass that client. Of course.	
2	Hmm. Yeah.	
1	Also, you can shoot in a certain way that can hide that stuff. So things like so you can bring a white cardigan with you to the wedding and just you know button enough over him.	
2	So we're all good then also you can throw a blanket over her. I don't know. Yeah, it's whatever works. It's like, oh see that tree go stand behind it. Do you want me to seek out know?	
1	It's really bad.	
2	Oh my God. I hate that picture. So I know so do I this is like I wouldn't be caught dead doing that photo. No you just go stand there.	
1	So as a male photographer, could I just maybe say something like look I need you to fix your dress. You look fantastic. But if I'm going to put these photos on Facebook, I'm going to have to put a black bar across your chest.	
2	Nope. Can I tell you Steven you need to sandwich it body shaming you need a sandwich it you got to start with the compliment throw the little critique in there and then end with the compliment true, but you look great. Your kids are awesome. But there's a lot of them. So like I would told him motorboat you right now, but put the button there. Yeah, but mmm so guys just like I guess what we're saying is if you know someone Who's getting married and there's just they're really out there and you think this might happen to them do them a kindness and very nicely way ahead of the wedding discuss the you know tailoring of the dress with or they'll end up in the shaming group. It would be bad. I mean, yeah that shouldn't have happened but it happened it's life. That's what happens. So from the Chive, we have a story that we want to share with you. I got a little too drunk on my wedding night. Who am I kidding? I'm nice. Yeah, who am I getting? I was wasted everyone kept buying me drinks. So I kept on drinking. So my wife and I finally get into bed and we both agree. It's not going to happen. So that's a whole other good topic so off to sleep whiskey dick. Yeah, that's the thing. It is so off to sleep I go. Well, my flesh wasn't willing but the spirit sure was you see I suffer from a condition called sex and sexsomnia. Sorry can't say it. People sleepwalk some people sleep talk. I sleep fuck. Uh-huh. I tend to fondle my wife in my sleep. The poor thing has gotten used to it. Usually giving opinions stop me. Well that night. She didn't realize my condition was acting up. She thought I had sobered up and wanted to consummate the marriage. So it happens and away we go I'd I woke up halfway through I was so confused and seeing my reaction my wife figured out what had happened. We had a laugh about it and Since we had started we decided to finish it. Nice. That's the thing. I mean, oh my gosh. That's the thing that But cute but he woke up like it's a thing inside. I know you no no, no, he they wake up and then they just get Amorous essentially. Yeah, he wakes up inside. Yeah. Oh my gosh, just blows my mind.	
1	You guys haven't heard of that.	
2	No, maybe maybe in their mind. It's really good when they're sleeping. Come on, you know, everyone has sex dreams your sex dreams are good. Like are always good. There's no like let down not that there is lucked out in real life tell you look at once again. This is a wedding podcast. But you know your sex dreams are you know often the best of the best right like the yeah, you know and your fantasies are fulfilled and all that shit. Yeah. So, I mean really, I wonder if it's like that I want your dreams. I know we all my sex dreams are always frustrating.	
1	It's always like trying to hide from the kids to have sex and it just they keep coming in like that's mine are so incredibly you're so stressful. I want Rebecca's dreams.	
2	I think we all do I wake up and I'm like, I'm good. Oh, jeez. Well, I think we have another one from the from the Chive. Yes. All right during our wedding. I had a close girlfriend of ours go back to the small cabin. We had rented for post-wedding consump consummation. Sorry I consumption it's when I got these off at the wedding and spread beautiful flower petals everywhere a trail of them leading to the bed. I told her with a wink she took it upon herself to take this task. Seriously flower petals everywhere all over the nice cabin floor the couch and all over the bed. So we go back to the cabin all Tipsy and proceeded to consummate our new partnership as husband and wife all over the floor the couch and yes the bed. It was awesome as it grows the way that's told all over the floor. Until the next morning when we realized that our overzealous and slightly sloppy game of Let's Pretend This is our first time had caused the petals to stain everything the white couch and pillow were now splotched with red pedal juice it hard. The hardwood floor was staying like a horrific scene from a cliche horror movie with a cabin in the woods the bed and duvet were both completely ruined and yes her wedding dress now looked like it had been washed with my red sock. Oh, no, it was awesome. And we spend our first morning as a couple scrubbing the floor. Yes. We lost our damage deposit. Oh my gosh Evil Dead the marriage. It's not so good. That's crazy. That is crazy. But I love the Chive.	
1	Look at that something to learn though. Like Valentine's Day. Don't don't sprinkle those red Gap power pedals white and Idols guys. I'm ways how tiring that story and thinking myself. Well that bride would probably be up for a trash the dress shoot now like, you know, yes, right that's true - the water seems like it would just be red petals just have to invest in those Roses Steve.	
2	Exactly. So do you guys happen to have any stories that you'd like to share or I mean no pressure.	
1	You don't have to do we Steve he's gonna jump a couple he has a well written down. He said I have like eight stories we could share just tell awesome. We're not we're definitely not going to share any that's going to throw our couples under the bus. So so of course not that's totally different ones called the client from Hell who was a total asshole. All right, I like that.	
2	No, no one or two of those.	
1	Oh, yeah, we do but this one's which one is this? So this one isn't this one is about an engagement. Not a wedding and it's actually a conversation that I overheard while Jen and I were at a restaurant like us awesome. So we live in Hamilton County which is it's like the most well-off County and all of Indiana. Yeah. It's so the richest county and Indiana is like top 30 in the u.s. So it's just like incredibly bujji. We don't fit in at all sides. This is this going to kind of paint the picture of the P the type of people that like that we are surrounded by so I heard a conversation going on between two women while sitting at a restaurant and Jen had taken Ian like on a walk and I was with Nora who was asleep just kind of rocking her and the conversation was so ridiculous that I just pulled my phone out and immediately started transcribing everything. They were saying - nice and this is this is what they said and I was engaged but I wasn't getting married because it was like we were engaged in the winter. Not that summer. So then my best friend asked me to kiss him and I was like whatever I'm only winter engaged anyway, so I didn't want to kiss him because we're besties but I did because a kiss means nothing anyway, and as soon as I did I knew there was nothing between us because it was like gross and I only really liked hanging out with him for his car and money. Anyways, then like I broke off. Engagement because this was the perfect excuse in my best friend ended up engaged a week later to someone else in married before summer. Like how could he so I didn't even go to the wedding even though I supposed to be in it. I did text him though to let him know that he was a terrible kisser.	
2	He hasn't talked to me since leave that wow, that is petty as fuck. Yeah, that's bujji. Wow. I can't believe you overheard this. I'm actually impressed with his transcription skills. Yeah, right. Oh, yeah, you have a side hustle. I would be like sorry ma'am. Can you repeat that last one?	
1	And it was a real sloppy and there is a lot of cleaning up and post I had to do because it was just like swiping on my Google swipey keyboard thing and that leads me into so much trouble anyway, like on a normal day and this one one was a bit rough to get the Kinks worked out, but I would have just reported it I was I wasn't certain that. I was close enough to really get like the like good audio, right? I just come out with mumbly stuff. Plus I have like this thing where a lot of times I'll take my phone into the ocean or the pool other stuff like that. So the microphone doesn't work great. I got it. It's true.	
2	That'll do it. What's winter engaged? What the hell? Is that? How you gonna get you to season when you can't get your engagement photos done? Will be during a good photo time of year. Like I don't know.	
1	That's just what I would guess Jen and I talked about this conversation so many times since then because it's just so but wild like the idea of winter engaged like is so crazy to me and then like the idea that well she kissed her best friend. So I guess doesn't count for these huge break off an engagement even though they kissed encounters just like this is this is like an insane thing that I've overheard and then I've now experienced in my life. My life, I didn't think people did this sort of stuff to each other. Wow, someone could just explain that to us though because it it's literally the question of the century perhaps winter engage what is winter engage?	
2	Someone knows what winter engaged is then sounds like a Game of Thrones reference. That's what I was going to say. Yeah winter came. As a podcaster just starting out or a seasoned Pro.

1	So we have a couple more stories if you guys don't mind sharing So this one is one of my favorites. Thankfully this didn't happen to us. It wasn't us that did this but it was involved with another photographer in the area. Apparently the wedding was going really late and she felt like she was being mistreated the photographer and she was being taken advantage of because the wedding just kept going super late. So apparently she'd been waiting for a piece of cake. So her time had run out. They still hadn't Cut the Cake so she decided to go to The Keg take the knife. Cut the top tier and half slide it onto a plate and got the hell out of there.	
2	Yeah it out. Yeah, the photographer did that. Yes. She's my fucking Hero guys. I like I like cake. Yeah, but if you're being taken advantage of yeah, well, I don't know that's ball. I've been taking advantage of so early before so as Lisa knows and you know why I never had the balls to do anything about it, but I always yell - it's a diamond. I was like, did you charge them extra for saying I never did that though. I'm always like cool. It's this much more from yeah, you know, it's yeah, I love cake.	
1	I try so hard not to eat cake every single wedding because I'm eating literally a piece of cake every single day for like if we were to condense all the wedding's it would be a piece of cake every single day of a month. So I've got really feel bad. I think that the top tier is a little bit safe. Red though, I would have at least took the bottom.	
2	Yeah, ya did do we know what if the couple ever said anything to her about it?	
1	No, I assumed that they were all very intoxicated entire prison shooting weddings anymore. We know that much.	
2	Yeah, but I didn't yet.	
1	It really does.	
2	Yeah, you hit a point you do you hit a point where you're just like no, I'm done. I'm done and I went through that. I'm just I'm done. Do you guys think Are going to be doing it for a long time. Do you have any rough sense of that? Like if you want to yeah do it for like 20 more years or been done for the last five years.	
1	We're taking a lot less just because we realized more is not better for us. It just ends up like the way that we have approached weddings. It just doesn't work for us. But I do we do have like an associate photographer. So we're trying to get Of those books and then only take in just a couple for ourselves so we can still enjoy it. I imagine that will still be shooting in the next five years, but I see myself as a position of management then opposed to be in like a leaf.	
2	Yeah prefer. Yeah, so you have like a long-term idea of how to switch it up a bit keep things interesting for yourself. And how long have you guys been in it?	
1	20 20 January 2020 will be 10 years right around the same time as	
2	Us yeah, yeah Rebecca had said before everybody tends to start making big life decisions as photographers around the 10-year Mark. Go ahead and it's true and you either decide to stay in it longer or you decide to jump ship like I did and just completely change it up. So for they do something like to change. Yeah just to change it up or yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, that was towards me. It was a total selfish reason I was asking I was just curious because I always ask people Yeah, like how long they've been in it and where their heads at that point because it seems to be a trend. Yeah or not. You decide no long-term or I'm going to do some a little different or I'm out like yeah, I would say it's really long term.	
1	I don't really see very many people doing it long term like staying in the wedding industry long-term because people talk about how stressful it is to plan a wedding. Well, this is our life like we're part of it all the time. So yeah. Yeah in a part of that stress all the time can really wear you down. Down not that it's just some people like Thrive off of that and I think a little I do work really well when I'm under pressure, but I also need like a mental break like I have to take an entire month off just for like my my sanity just so that only few it for so long Jennifer right like you.	
2	Yeah, you can only do it for so long. I love that. You said that especially to all of our listeners because a lot of them are planning wedding stuff and I think a lot of people tend to forget that we are in it all the time. It doesn't end it. It's your wedding planning process. Like it's crazy. Exactly. It's a great Point. I've never you put it so well, you're making me feel less guilty for leaving. Oh you should you gotta do you girl? Yeah, and I put in 10 good years so together, you know, there you go, but I'm the industry is going to miss you though. Ah, yeah here that's okay. Somebody wants to pay me enough. I'll come doing is right. The money's writer. It's a nice destination that I want to do. We'll talk about it. Yeah, it's really really sweet client. But mostly I just yeah time time to change time to move on and I think that's healthy and and or you know, knowing what you want like going more towards a managing style over the next five years, you know, totally makes sense special with kids right like beacons it gets harder and for sure with a family for sure. I miss I miss I missed out on a lot when my kids were little. Yeah, and so he's like a me To me in a way because she's in a different a little bit. She's in the same place as me but a little bit different as well. So she's in a different place with the families saying place in the career. So she's like I missed all this when my kids were younger. So I'm using use a mirror to be like, I don't want to make not the same mistake, but do you know what I mean? Yeah, definitely a mistake. Why do you know for me? It was a mistake because I tried to do too much you try to do ya for sure. I was trying to do double and triple weekends like it was pretty betters. Yeah.	
1	Yeah good. Yeah, that is so hard and And it's so hard to recover to as you get older. That's what I've learned. I mean we started doing this when I was what 20 23 24 saying? Yeah, and it was so yeah it was so it was so much easier back then and now as I'm getting older it's like the the wedding hangover is a real thing. Like I cannot get out of bed on Sunday because I am so exhausted. I feel like I ran a marathon.	
2	Yeah. Yep. Oh, yeah, you know, it's funny when my kids were little and I was doing weddings. We would I would shoot a Friday. Another Saturday wedding and then on the Sunday, I would have off sometimes and my we would of course I have little kids they want to go to the beach. They want to do this. They want to do that. You know, we want to do family things and my husband would get everything ready and we would go to the beach. Yep, and I would fall asleep. Of course, you know, I couldn't I couldn't stay awake to save my life. Like it was just brutal and I missed out, you know on these Beach days because I couldn't stay away. It was just it sucked. Yeah. It sucked. I loved it. I loved my job. I still like my job. I love my job. I feel like it's a place in time career. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, and I'm 41. So that wedding hangover. Let me tell you at 41 can brutal. Yeah and I were going everybody fucking brutal and I don't 34 it's fucking brutal. Yeah as you get older. Yeah, it's definitely a lot her. Yeah really taxing on the back and stuff. Yes. I'll tell you that much.	
1	Absolutely the story I entitled broken glass in the toilets, which is Pretty much just like wrap it up just from that. So I know you're shooting a wedding a few years ago in a rural farming Community. It was the kind of wedding where the bride and groom get married in the most expensive venue in town, which is surprisingly elegant, but then they still have a lot of guests who show up in jeans and untucked final shirts. Oh dear. So one guest even had on overalls at the reception. But anyway, the venue was having problems getting the food ready on time to serve the meal so they decided that to keep the A guest happy, they just extend the cocktail hour and give the bride and groom a discount on the Alcohol which always seems like a good idea except at the venue ran out of hors d'oeuvres about half hour earlier before this happened. So there is about an hour and a half and a half where people were just grabbing drinks at the open bar without eating any food. So bunch of drunk guys are in the restroom with their drinks in hand and one of them accidentally dropped his glass into the urinal while he was Oh crap, because you know, you want to have a glass while you're peeing that's course coming down.	
2	It's so big so you have scale for the dick pic that you're taking.	
1	I promise. This isn't a shot glass. This is a full-size one. So the other guys who are in the restroom with him thought this was hilarious and they threw their glasses into the urinals as well. God our later. The venue has people posted outside the men's restroom because so many guys have gone in in there to throw their glasses into the urinals that they now feel they need to stop every guest who's going in to check to make sure they don't have glass on them enter me with my camera, which I don't put down on a wedding day ever anywhere. They don't let me in the restroom because my camera has lenses that have my God and they're afraid I'll break one of our lenses in the toilet.	
2	Stupidest thing I've ever said it like it's so dumb.	
1	I can't even that wedding was a I love said couple the couple was just absolutely fantastic their guests were assholes.	
2	If you imagine you come home from the wedding you like Jen. I broke a 2000 our lens, but it was the fucking funniest thing in the world.	
1	People eventually made it into the restroom. I just gave my camera to Jen and when I got in there, it's just like well, there's just broken glass and piss all over the floor. I can't I don't have to go anymore.	
2	This is crazy solved all my problems for oh god. Well, you guys have given us some amazing Stories. So let's give you a few more. So this one I think is still from the tribe. Is that fair to say Rebecca? No different one. It right it. Okay. The bride was a former nun. That's awesome already who left her order not long after taking her vows to marry a friend of my significant others Family during the wedding ceremony the priest kept staring at her shaking his head slightly and making facial expressions that displayed his disappointment in her decision. It came as specially awkward during his homily when he said keeping the vows we make whether nuptial vows or religious says much about our integrity and sincerity dick. Oh, yeah, he's fun. That's not very nice. Let's invite him to the wedding. That's invited. That's really nice. By the way prayer before dinner. I forgot to tell people for the big boob ride host. It's in our group. So if you want to see that postcode fantasy Girl - yeah.

It's like the dress barely covers, you know, I don't care who you are. I have very large chest and mine are always never going to spill out like come on. Should we do a reenactment with you? Alright, my father-in-law was super hammered and came into my Bridal Suite screaming at me that my mom was a bitch nice. It took four bridesmaids to hold me down because I was going to punch him then my husband got pissed.

1	Alright, let's imagine you like making eye contact with him just staring him down and eating that chocolate actually guys like to see things in women's mouths, but I don't want to see them bite it that's true.	
2	And I was just like I've been avoiding doing this, but I have no shame anymore. I really want to eat chocolate right now. So if you would have licked it and then like looked at him looked it and then bit it that we've been fucking

2	He came all the way even funnier. Everyone's done it on a truck. From your hitch. Okay, sticky ride. Yeah for by the seats are so take. Okay. I'm choosing to ignore this. I'm going to repeat this again and see if you can get through without any dirty jokes. You can't I can't he came all the way on the train from your Hannah's Berg to Pretoria South Africa to see me. I was late so I ran towards him. Don't ask me why okay at this exact moment my sandal broke and I fell on my face. Face mid stride and pretty much get along the floor in front of him in the train station. That was our first and last date so sad, I don't think it was so funny. She ran towards him and she just this is their first day.	
1	That's a little little odd Oh, I thought it was the fact that he already came. So he wasn't going to work for it after that starts see someone running at you.	
2	And the first day you just turned start running back the other direction. Like no, I'm good. My date opened the car door for me. I panicked and slammed it shut. He must have been fucking ugly chivalry's not dead, darling. Next story I went out with a guy. I had met at a concert a few days before our date. He was 15 minutes late forgot his wallet asked for a ride to the bus so he could go to hang out with friends. And as for 20 bucks for a train ticket, very nice. Very nice Jesus.
