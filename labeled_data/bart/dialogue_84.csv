Anyway, you want words wallet Word of Mouth there anything besides words and what what's another w-why are we wishes if you want to wish upon a star for us. And why do we keep talking about this?	
3	I don't know. Let's move next section.	
4	What's the next section where we are going to talk about worst parenting store. So we're two part to the Reckoning this time. It's personal so this We bought our Christmas tree and decorated it.	
3	I don't know why people do that.	
4	Why buy a Christmas tree?	
2	It's because of Jesus Christ died in its time words were buy a tree put a lot of shit on it and then but wait, why are you little bit more? Yeah Presidents honor me and the most Pagan fashion possible.	
4	Big fat and gone who's taking this down years ago in John New Haven. I like it years ago in New Haven Connecticut. There was a tree on the green that supposedly a Jesus face on it. And I've not seen the tree but I'm gonna guarantee you it did not have Jesus face on it. It's just like my God. That's a guess. It's a guess.	
3	Here's why I say, why do you buy a tree so early by our tree in the 19th?	
4	Can I explain to you? Why can I explain to you?	
2	Why? Nope? That's all we have time for. We'll find out part 9.	
4	The reason is Mom and buried she does she enjoys what you might like to call Aka hanging out with the tree. You're a so-so. We put what he'll say so we I know what you said. We put the tree up we decorate it and then she spends the month hanging out watching Lifetime and Hallmark fucking bullshit Christmas movies. I had to watch the fucking the the football game in the bedroom last night on our worst TV because she needs to hang out with the tree in the living room with the lights on and all that shit when she needs to maximize it as much as possible. So we get the tree this weekend.	
2	The only reason we got it this early when you say hang out like you mean she will G near it. Yes. It's almost like a therapy tree. Sure. Yeah, but you know what? Hey, whatever floats your boat.	
4	It's good for her but Thanksgiving was so late. Like it was the last week of the month, which normally is not maybe not normally know sometimes it's earlier. Sometimes it falls on like the 23rd or something, right? So the 28th is someone who wants I think was a 2087.	
3	Yeah 28 28th, right?	
4	I know your daughter. At the I know so it's a little late and she just wants to maximize the amount of weekends we have with it, especially since we go to Connecticut for like the week of Christmas. I'm not luck Todd's of the tree surviving when it's right next to the fucking radiator is not great.	
3	Why do you go for so long the week of Christmas like wouldn't it be better just to go for like a night or two and then just like get back, you know, sometimes you know what we talked about this and another episode such everything you saying is is that it's know what	
2	You're fucking too much. You know what? This is the worst guy talking about power right with you too baggy for going to get into the real shit in a minute.	
4	God damn it.	
3	2400 hey, Mike, have you heard of Spotify before?

Also, make sure to follow me and Pete so you never miss an episode of the dead and buried show. - were talking first cuz I think Pete wants to and I'm cutting you off to tell you you're being open.	
2	You were being a little baby about once a your Christmas tree story and I want to let everyone know that you're being a baby and get a word in your fucking goddamn, right? It's the dead and buried podcast. Not the fucking Pete. Nobody's ever heard of podcast and Pete. And it's a newest. All right.	
4	So look Pete thinks it's ridiculous that are in my house. We get the Christmas tree. So early Nate just chimed in and said he agreed with my wife. He said hanging out with the trolls now and I go that's very sweet.	
3	Okay, so that's very strange what the new tradition that we have. I'll call it new because I think we my parents used to put up an honor not a live tree, but fake tree.	
4	Yeah, fake tree decide what you say not a light one. You to say a fake tree your you see, you know, like you say.	
3	Well first of all, it's Christmas trees in England are the grossest things you've ever they're like the most anemic. There's like a literally a branch and then there's tree.	
4	I literally it's so every time you mention something about your childhood in England. I have to remember the fact that you fucking grew up in England. I still don't believe it. Okay.	
3	Well so that that happened anyway, so then so then smash cut to my own family. Yeah.	
2	It's a smash cake from this. These sad trees like a me. Mommy. Should I put this little thing on their kids don't oh, that's going to Newark it.	
3	Are we getting a tree but that yeah, no bitch were waiting for the 19th of December.	
2	But why would we do this is amazing because it's gonna die and I'm not gonna die real quick and it happened but you gotta get a good tree. We've had trees at last the whole time.	
4	We have your Lana. I'm not yeah.	
3	Look inside your soul.	
4	You're lying inside. What's Soul I'm not lying the worst is when it's dead and it when your leap when your	
2	Moving it out. Yeah daggers into yeah just know we've had some where we were shocked.	
4	So we have a new tradition.	
3	This is the last four or five years where we will invite our Jewish friends over and they'll their kids get to help because they're excited to decorate the truck in love it. And by the way, I don't know if I didn't agree with me, but I think decorating trees kind of a pain in the ass. I agree 1 million percent which is why I was getting people that are more excited and much more work. So it is great while I stand my end.	
4	Google so we bought our tree on Saturday and because they fucked up the trunk as I said this on the live earlier, right? So like usually the tree place trims the trunk and trims the shitty branches the bottom of the tree cleans it up for you and I think because we bought a tree from like this look specials rack and we didn't realize it the guy didn't give us any fucking but he didn't even put it in the tree stand with a lot of times I do for you to have to worry about that. You didn't do that. So we get home and I get rid of some of these shitty branches and there's like two feet of just bear trunk. Mama Bear was not having it. So we didn't end up decorating on Saturday night. How tall is the tree at the end like four feet? No, it's actually still pretty tall because we got one without all that it was like bumping the top of the ceiling we have tall ceiling. Yeah, so we didn't end up decorating them Saturday night, which was the plan. So on Sunday morning. I had to saw part of the tree off with a hand saw and then we decorate it on Sunday afternoon and the entire time we're doing a time like I am so glad my nine-year-old is 9 years old so that he can decorate the tree so that I don't have I can do it except I still had to do wrap around with this is the worst part wrap around with the lights that and then like the beads and all that shit.	
2	And then the I fucking I have a tweet about this where like my son's like hey, can I help decorate the tree? I'm like, I'm like sure he's like, what do we do with like what we put up the lights and then Mom and tell mommy tells us what we did wrong goes through and rearrange the lights and fixes the branches.	
4	I just like I really I honestly don't give a shit. But what's funny about hanging out with the tree when I was a kid our tree was in the the living room which like we had a family room and the	
2	living room we get living room was like that and you were eight like an attic wild pheasant you say the family room was like nobody hung out in there except on the holidays really write the living room is where the TV was we hung out.	
4	So like there was no hanging out with the tree unless as a kid, maybe you want to hang out in there or like after the fact we're all the presents are under you're hanging out with the presents and stuff. But now you live in an apartment you have three rooms, right? And the tree is just in your face at all times.	
3	I mean, don't get me wrong. I do love a good Christmas tree hang It's just I like the time frame to be a little bit more condensed. Yeah just can't have it the whole time because guess what these trees.	
4	They absorb a lot of water. They did a water them all the time.	
3	By the way, that's sap, that's app is out for vengeance it is it hits you and your family.	
4	It's ready to kill some fucking people up in here so I can hear where it gets in here. It does get everywhere. I've seen National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. We're turning the magazine and if so, so look you may think that	
2	that this is the Christmas episode is not the Christmas episode is gonna be next week where we talk about shopping and stuff.	
4	This is chores. And I do think that's a good point you like that extra sound is that decorating the tree is not a common chore because you only do it once a year, but it is a shitty chore and it's actually one place where kids come in handy if they're old enough they're excited about it and they do a lot of the work and you can sit back and do whatever this weird thing you did you bitch that's a bit.	
2	What do you make that that can't German mulled wine?	
3	No Swedish glogg.	
4	Glug glug missed a good you look pretty Swedish. I am I'm Swedish. So last time if you remember correctly. Oh, I wanted to know I'm wearing my glasses today for the first using means everybody. Wow. I never wear my glasses today for the first time on the podcast because you know what the people demanded it. Yep and put up a poll and people voted for it. And the people that voted against it.	
2	I can see their names and they're going to get you know, a bag of dicks in the Male, you know we can actually fucking order those. You know, what is it makes you so much more sophisticated does make me sophisticated as you just demonstrated.	
4	Yeah with my disgusting burp. I apologize for any one who had to hear that. So last two weeks ago. We did the worst parent teachers episode. And basically we got through bedtime and a couple other times it's dinner time and some other shit and there's a lot of stuff we didn't get to and we had so many comments and so many different little topics within it that we wanted to finish it off. So that's what we're doing today and the first One of the top of the paper maybe not the top of the list but the top of the paper that I put together is homework. So today my kid gets home and he has to do like reading responses once a month where he has to do basically like a really brief book report on whatever book He's reading. I had to sit down with him and like help them structure it because like each there's three paragraphs and each one has to have kind of a different thing. I'm sitting with them and I much prefer this to math homework with him because the mass shit. I can't even do half it like it's getting more snow. He's in fourth grade is getting more sophisticated in the Common Core just the principles of it are tough. And before you start bashing Common Core. Yeah. I find it difficult. I understand the rationale behind it essentially is to give you like mechanisms be able to do math in your head in a more logical way the kind of the way that we do it like if you're breaking up a tip. You divide it by 10 you do all that shit right away with not really how we were taught. We were taught memorization and all that shit. Whatever. I'm not going to get in a comic or different app.	
2	We already got a micro lesson on we definitely did some we did some writing but so like he uses the computer to write his thing and you know, how like spell check or like a grammar like if there's a proper noun.	
3	He doesn't write it with him.	
4	No, they letting him use computers and like his handwriting sucks and he hates it. So we're like fine, you know, nobody's gonna be my handwriting is an absolute joke, it's based its cursive because I start to write so fast and it just it's a mess and no one can be I can't even read it. So he types which is fine. It's the skill he needs to learn but like he can't deal with the red line that shows you that it's like a misspelling or a grammar issue or it's a proper noun and I fucking even knows what proper nouns I don't know when they learn that.	
2	He's like, why is this show a red line? I'm like dude. I'm like that doesn't matter like you're writing on a fucking computer.	
4	You can spell check and fix all this stuff later. You just got to get your thoughts out right and he can't fucking	
2	Get past the red line and he's like I can't do it. I'm like dude. There's fucking Cisco just write your damn thoughts of a fink clean that up after know he won't do it.	
4	I fucking hate it and I hate sitting down and doing homework with my kid because of so, what does he and of course then complains about having to do it becomes like he's like flying and oh, yeah, or he throwing a fit or he gets so frustrated that it just puts the whole thing. That's a the proceedings come to a halt. It's just super A frustrating and I don't want to do homework.	
2	I spent 20 years of my life doing homework. I'm over it.	
3	Yeah, and I think everyone would agree.	
4	Well handmade is better says homework was her least favorite parenting chore. It brings out both of our ugly sides from her laziness and my stubbornness which is exactly right, right. Like he doesn't want to do it. He gets frustrated I give up so easily and then I'm like you have to fucking do it this way. I'm just fucking furious and it's too early to have a beer and you just like locked in this. Oh my God, and we are so similar. And we just it just it's a meltdown from the fucking start. G-dog Tha no idea if that's what I'm supposed to say GD OG Tha I like it you like when I break down the usernames got it figured out right on are in real time. She says not understanding the math getting them to do it and then whining the whole time yeah trying to break down the rationale behind someone like the Common Core techniques is beyond me half the time.	
3	Well, I'm often I go I go right to the internet. I'm just like common YouTube videos and shit.	
4	Yeah. Yeah, I don't really do that.	
3	You got to do that and then but also what I find out what I find sometimes works is if I start doing I'm like let me do it. Look no. No, you're doing it wrong. Like well, how do you do it and they're so pissed?	
4	Yeah.	
3	I'm about to do it. They start explaining it and like see and like you just did the problem and then like, oh, wow, look at me move this final hack hack life hack. So I gue antagonize just enough to get them to realize the To within themselves just like the movie Rudy. He wasn't agonized his whole life.	
2	He antagonize and on has underestimated.	
4	It wasn't Agony was he was there was a lot of good protagonist at their antagonizing that a lot of good protagonists. You're on the side of the bully listen shut with my sweater Beauty Rudy, but that movie anyway, so today my son was writing his little reading response. And and the the first sentence is this is the name that I've read the Artemis. As foul book and I didn't want to read it. But my dad this is what he's writing, but my dad forced me to and it turns out I liked it and as I'm reading he's like you can't say anything about that.	
2	You can't bully me. I'm like, I'm not gonna bully you but like you tell the kid for like months like you need to Branch out and recent you might like this thing and he's fucking so reluctant to admit it and then he finally admits any gets mad because I'm proofreading his thing.	
4	Yeah, but he was mad that I mean you can't take credit but you arm and I am like Mad Dog.	
2	Yeah.	
4	Well I do that I went to get when I put him to bed. Jay Sears, eiga bring-bring brings it a little bit broader. So it doesn't like the homework, but she hates all the school paper work the permission slips the lunch orders the hours each week. So my kid will bring home a folder. Yeah and a half of the folder is like homework or stuff for him. And the other half is like stuff for the parents. Look at that. Maybe once every three weeks missing all sorts of permission sense. Yeah. Yeah vital piece of but his teachers this year actually send emails would like here's tonight's homework and stuff that you can look at but look too many emails.	
3	Well as it get up. We're my middle schoolers on Jupiter Grades so that you can like log in at any time.	
4	Oh, yeah.	
3	We're not there yet, but I've heard that yeah, but having said that so are my oldest daughters 12 is in Middle School. Their school is taken an reduced homework stance. So they had I love it. They they're Or their pets Studies have shown there's no benefit and right and so I used to do a shitload of homework and I'm not an advocate of homework.	
4	I'm like really Jamie just causes frustration for everybody.	
3	I'm stupid and it doesn't you are stupid. So yeah and is because of all the homework I had to do all the homework made you stupid exactly and so but what they do is anything they give them periods in school. They let them finish their homework and if they don't finish it, they have to finish it home, right? Okay.	
2	But they give them time it's gonna do it which is like if you had a study hall right?	
4	You could do your homework. You're like Jack fucking pot.	
3	I know but except for I for whatever reason I somehow this actually works and they usually do most of their homework during that so I remember having study hall but I don't remember doing I don't know man.	
4	You know what I was like fucking Doogie Howser back then I fucking do it homework.	
3	You would do this dude, you fucking house.	
4	Yeah, you were super hot. I was writing a fucking computer.	
2	That's what that's pretty big. People remember about Doogie Howser lievable tight-ass. He's out. Yeah. What's how's that song go is that that was right.	
3	I'm just saying like I'm loving it just it's not that she has I think he's hot.	
4	You know what I'm just glad you need to bring the energy out. But I'm glad I got a little bit out of here.	
2	All right, you don't think to see houses attractive. How about now Neil Patrick Harris? He's unbelievable. Thank you. He's a quadruple threat.	
4	I saw him on stage and Hedwig and the Angry Inch. It was pretty impressive Dynamic performance you my wife made me go to that.	
2	You know what I'm a fucking renaissance man. Are you live in New York City? I take advantage of the culture you take advantage.	
4	All right.	
2	Have you seen the cats trailer is Tom have you it's like an absolute Abomination I can use this movie for it's like a parody doesn't make any sense. It's like as if someone made a movie within a movie that was supposed like it's like yeah, like it's like you're watching a movie like here's the shitty movie Hollywood made and they showed a clip from cat. Should be like in Tropic Thunder like one of those movies is the stupidest thing. Yeah, it looks like I don't even understand it. I don't understand. Why is the first CGI? Why can't they just wear cat bodysuits? Like on the the stage play? I don't fucking understand when I was a kid. I went to that.	
4	My parents bought me to Broadway. I saw three plays on Broadway. I think the same day. I don't know just have your internet's just made you cats which I fucking loved Phantom of the Opera which I fucking loved and lame as which I hated. And now the only I listened to Les Miz every once while I like it.	
2	Can you sing every say I can do you hear the people sing?	
4	Anyway, I met old Deuteronomy who's one of the cats and cats like it during one of the intermissions you go up and get it. He signed my playbill.	
2	It's a whole story is some fucking fat dude in the cat suits on my play. But you know, what if I went up to fucking Idris Elba who's in the new one, he wouldn't be in a cat suit. He was in fucking CGI, don't he?	
3	In a green suit, you'd be like, can you sign my play? Boom?	
4	Boom? Yeah, I put fucking you know what Stringer Bell he could sign anything he wants anyway, I don't know what how that just happened. We just got into cats.	
2	So now we're talking about doctors appointments. What a Segway. This is a podcast fantini 80 said taking kids for shots is terrible.	
4	We always lie and say we are going somewhere else and then spring it on them in the parking lot. It makes me feel so bad. That crying is terrible. It's like what you do to dogs.	
2	No, you can't do now that's what it was. So I didn't do that to my kids. I tell you that story how I went. I had to bring my kids for their flu shot last week and be like, hey, we like what we will go into like, you know the shot, you know them all and then the next thing you know, it's like actually going to get shots.	
4	Yep. Now they're scarred for life. Now, they're never going to trust you. It will never trust you ever again been teeny. I gotta be heard it from Pete. Yeah.	
2	It's get fucking psyched up, you know later in life game might turn you on sexually this do it, right? Sorry. That's it.	
4	That's how I had it done to me. Just being imposed a so they have to peel my son out of the car. He's afraid of shots. Even the finger prick. Yeah, aren't we all I'm fucking terrified of shots. I'm not into it the flu shot.	
2	Yeah, you know when they they do that thing they like take a little blood do a little dance.	
4	Well get down tonight.	
2	No, take a little blood like they do a little dance get down tonight. I don't think there's something they do they did it to me at my new job or they have a gun sight.	
4	I know she's petitioners that is that three weeks in a row with a wolf Federally or did we miss a week diet diet? Yeah - anyway, nobody likes shots fuck shots.	
2	I know the flu shot doesn't hurt and I'm still terrified every time I know what I saw.	
4	I like liquor shots less than I like actual fucking doctor shots at this age. They're more painful the next day. I want to kill myself if I take shots. So you would rather take know I was that was being fucking hyperbolic and facetious fucking deal with it. Little bit 1 1 1 3 says doctor The worst that's what my boys turn up their ass. Wholeness. That's why I'm Detective Munch turned up his ass on this of the shot. He was so scared about getting a shot and he was just fucking going. No, it's good.	
3	It's well, if we my wife I haven't done it in my wife. She brings all three and then they she says this kid this one's doing better than you and then they started competing who can take a shot better.	
2	I like I was trying that's what I try to do to my kid. Like you said like you do in Hamilton, what does that mean? I'm not gonna get into it.	
4	You won't appreciate it. Anyway, so I had to bring my three year old and my nine year old and I'm trying to get my nine-year-old to go first because I know my nine-year-old is fucking all in his head about this that if my three-year-old cries and he's three so he's gonna cry it's going to make my nine-year-old even more anxious and scared. So I'm trying to get him to go for as he refuses to go first.	
2	They do it to my nine-year-old. He doesn't even fucking know what happened hits his army goes would you do that for like it was like the most amazing thing I've ever seen didn't	
4	Right, I barely noticed it nine-year-old still just it was just like you had to strap them down. It was hysterical. He was hysterical.	
2	He just think he thinks about it so much he gets so anxious then it gets done and he won't even admit that it barely hurt even though it did five minutes later.	
4	He's fucking having the time of his life. Just asking to play video games or whatever and you're like you fucking realize we just put me through.	
3	I doubt that. He's having the time of his life, but you know what? Yeah.	
4	You don't know he did the whole dance. He jumped onto Patrick Swayze's arms. He was having the time. Okay, Caitlin. Riordan says she hates shots hit her daughter has a condition that requires a shot every night. Oh, oh no and a different shot one time a week. So Mom a very has Ms. And one of the the medication she was on required a shot like three times a week and you have to rotate where you take it on your body or else it gets like a yeah, like scar and bring yeah, and I had to do the shot a lot of the times fucking nightmares. It was worse. Me than it was for obviously. It wasn't but like being the person who's not a Doctor Who's like I is the whole little there's a whole little shop machine is a machine that shoots in in but like every time like she like flipped like a diabetes one where you like it goes pound. It just says it's sort of like a sort of yeah sure exact probably exactly like that.	
2	But just it made me so nervous like when she felt pain from and I felt bad giving somebody a shot sucks, especially if you have to give it to a kid, so I feel for Kaitlyn.	
3	It wasn't like a nightmare needle that you'd like putting her on how the doctors kind of like a oh, no.	
4	No, it was encased you put in case to the thing and had like a mechanism where I went but it still sucked em cede√±o 1981 of our patrons said that my kid has a rare disease hyper insolent hyperinsulinism sounds related to diabetes maybe the reverse which means we have to constantly check his blood sugar throughout the day and night. So guess who's getting up at 4 a.m. Late night drinking equals. Nope. Nope, we do what we have to do and I wouldn't change it for the world. World except you know, maybe not have the for am thing.	
3	Oh, wow, man. That's a lie, right? That's really yeah.	
4	That sucks. I mean Caitlin Reardon MCD 1980 that sucks to have to fuck. Yeah. I mean that's deal with that. We're gonna we're gonna do an episode on yeah like yeah ADHD and all that kind of stuff we're going to do that eventually probably in the new year because we're trying to keep it light. We're trying to keep it light and then you as we close out 2018 or 2019 next year's going to be fucking arm again when we close out a leg down here.	
3	Hmm, it's gonna be great 2019 of you're making fun of me eventually the 2020 we're gonna hit 2020 with a with a scorcher being diagnosed your kick off the new year you go guys.	
4	All right. So the next shitty time of day was the morning and I had a fucking disaster with my son this morning, but Monica send oval new no says preparing breakfast for school because they don't eat it and I have to wake them up lat 1075 frequent commentator says waking them up early when they're young but she has a 16 year old now and the attitude and laziness sucks. I told my son the other day because he was like astonished that he had like slept till 8:00 one weekend day and I'm like when you're a teenager like in college, you're going to sleep to like one. Yeah, I'm gonna blow your mind and it was the best thing in the world doing that.	
3	I loved it because well did it did he continued his late sleeping or does he get up early 90s, so we had this issue where kids would	
4	Always come up in the middle of the night are or we tried to stop them. You can't come up until five and they would come in and lay with us. Is that over the past like two weeks seems like that has stopped ocean and now I have to go down and get them which is has its pros and cons but is better than I'm sleeping better because they're not coming to my room and waking me up and wake yourself up now, but I got to wake myself up but I also have to go get them up and it makes things more urgent right because they're less awake because they haven't woken up already and If you go down there and sometimes they're still asleep.	
3	And is that like what 6:30 6:45, it's for the yeah. Okay. Yeah, the we're definitely in the you know, the tweenage with my oldest daughter who's you know every but what's really interesting actually even my nine-year-old will on Saturday mornings. 6:30 boom, both of them, you know the weekend why you've nothing going on for the future have any of the equipment that you have? No appointments. You've nothing going on for the first half of the day and then the next thing you know these guys but they're they're all awake at 6 o'clock in the morning. But but on of course on the on the school day, it's a nightmare to get these guys up and I think that's a human thing though.	
4	I don't think that's just kids right? So like It's a little bit different when you have kids you been conditioned by work and having kids the but yeah, it's like but on a Saturday you're like, I want half.	
2	I'm gonna have fun today. I'm gonna do what I want. And so that's when you're in school you like.	
4	I don't want to get up and go to the fucking drudge of school and super frustrating though.	
3	So I normally get up do breakfast get the kids up and do the lunches.	
4	Yeah, we've talked about that's unbelievable. We talked about the last episodes of the packing lunch.	
3	It is when the amount of food that just comes back. I just want to be like wow, I don't give a fuck if you eat or not. I actually don't just because I want you to be so hyung don think you're going into the garbage.	
2	They have free meals at the school. Yeah, but they're like little Groove my kid comes home today and says all he had was I don't remember what he said. All I had was this they had mozzarella sticks. It was gross and like if they fucking surf mozzarella sticks for free at my school. I would be fucking 500 pounds. What are you talking about? Kid doesn't like mozzarella sticks. I don't really like mozzarella.	
4	That's what your point was caused because he's like you already are from him and you fat shit.	
2	You know, what's keeping post-thanksgiving.	
4	It's rude. So a my best, you know, what try a little harder Dana bows day says, I'm so low in the am getting them ready for school and I often find myself saying why are you naked? But yeah, it's hard to get she said she has a hard time getting close our kids.	
3	How about socks? Oh my God. Fuck.	
4	Yeah is the very hard with socks very cool socks.	
3	We have this countertop. I can't always see what's going on. Everyone will be fully dressed now that okay. Let's go to the bus is here. We hit down the stairs. I turn the corner not a single kid has size socks on they wear it so they go to school without socks.	
2	No, they don't of course it goes but oh your kids your mic. No, not that I think saying you got to the bus known and all these	
3	You know what?	
2	Watch it on. What do you mean? She's ever seen to be filled out those jeans.	
3	So Cycles are in his jeans. Yeah.	
4	So this morning my kid, he will come up and and a lot of times like so I lay out his clothes the night before a lot of times just because I don't find be with that makes a lot more sense and and every morning he'll be like you didn't bring me socks and I'm like	
2	Back and put the socks there and then I wait for him to go and I'm like they're there and it will go and then you just wait for him to say.	
4	Oh I found him or he just didn't say anything and then magically appear to the song but nobody does now sometimes	
3	This has nothing to do with socks.	
4	I'll bring him up because he they sleep downstairs and I'll bring them up and he'll fucking instead of like sitting on the bench at The Breakfast Table to eat. He'll lie down on the floor. Oh cuz he's tired like in his fetal position and like light on like he's gonna sleep. Yep. And then you like you got to hurry up. I'm moving you think I'm tired.	
2	Yeah, I'm fucking tired too. Yeah. What do you think?	
4	No, I work for a living you're tired and he'd be like, yeah, but that's rich.	
3	It's that's been a new occurrence though.	
4	Oh, wow, you know, I guess that because you usually work in fucking Yeah, yeah because he didn't say something under his breath today and said what do you say? Yeah when I'm upset, I don't know it wasn't about me being unemployed. It was about me being a failure when I was leaving. Yeah, J and M K 102 says the morning routine before working school is painful chaos, which really does sum it up. Mrs. Underscore gutful morning. Wake up routine because get out of bed for fuckity fuck sake I have to go to work. That's the other thing.	
2	It's like we're on a schedule like I'm not doing this. Us for kicks like we have to catch the bus if you miss the bus it fuck's up my entire day.	
4	It really does and everyone's days and I'll be so fucking pissed and you won't like it you already think I'm too fucking grumpy is the word they use for Dad hates his life. You're always so grumpy. That's their euphemism. Yeah. Well that's perpetuated by you.	
2	I'm just grumpy. I'm not pissed you. Yeah, right exactly.	
4	Exactly. Mmm Newcombe getting my two-year-old and five years ready for school in the morning.	
2	Before we go that's the thing. It's always we have things to do is half. The reason we need to get them situated and finished and done. It's really it really sucks. I really hate it Sweet Melissa 78-77.	
4	Oh the bus stop. I'm not a morning person to begin with me. Neither. I gotta get up at 6:30 get my daughter up and ready do her hair. I don't have to do that. I gotta get dressed and I gotta go outside with a son is still coming up. So that's what I do. So today I worked from home and when I work from home, I'll bring him to the bus stop like in a hoodie and my flip-flops sometimes and then come back and maybe get back in bed if I can or if I have work to do just start doing work, but it's just a little bit more comfortable. Like I don't have to race to the bus stop but most days I bring them to the bus stop and immediately leave like tomorrow and I just get on the train and I get to work but I am not at all awake in the morning and what wakes me up is my temper at them not being awake.	
3	It's like better than alarm clock. Well, that's a gift that keeps on giving then that's the gift that they've given you. Pure unadulterated anger anger.	
2	That's what having kids is all about.	
4	All right, so we got past that bullshit laundry and dishes neither of them ever end. No ever they don't laundry Nate.	
3	You have no idea.	
4	It seems unfathomable know how much fucking laundry there is it's to me.	
2	I don't understand it. You have three kids and girls.	
3	Yeah. Okay.	
2	I get I mean I can't even imagine but I'd be amount of clothes. My fucking toddler has it it blows your mind. It will blow your mind and I don't understand my wife when she folds close, but she never does anymore.	
4	I fold I fold every fucking item of clothing when she's like patent for us. This has nothing to with any just made me angry because today I was unpacking from Thanksgiving she folds shirts down the middle. Okay, like in half like this this just this I'm up its up.	
2	But you do you fold the sleeves over and you fold I would I would write for her.	
3	What is right or wrong.	
2	I take my Duncan Middle just don't like just here is just holds it in half and puts it in. Like what are you doing? What are you doing? I look like an asshole. Am I fucking meeting? I got a present and I got a long line down the center of my shirt here what you're close to yes, I'm saying the only time she falls closes if we're like packing or leave them somewhere because putting the luggage together so pack that's what He does he takes a T-shirt and should just fucking fold it in half.	
3	Why are you wearing t-shirt to a meeting?	
2	You know what stop poking holes. Where you going? It's a fucking I don't work at an agency, right?	
4	We're here to play ping-pong.	
3	No, so, I recently I had to do the packing. So my wife obviously we've talked about this. It's a no-fly zone when it comes to packing the kids for any trip. I'm relegated to one. Shutting the hell up at all. So why don't you just basically my wife does all the packing I can't do anything. I can't touch anything. That's great. It is good except for Thanksgiving this past Thanksgiving where my wife was like, you know, what because she didn't join us the whole Thanksgiving so you went early. No we went together, but my wife and my daughter came back to the city and then write for the ballet my other two kids. Yeah. We I stayed on for another few days. So she's like it's show time. Welcome to the show.	
4	You got a macaque. Yeah real you got a parachute to come home with yes.	
3	So then what happened I'm packing and I'm not I got this sound machine, like books got my what about the clothes? Come and lie under packed you under patroclus underpacked I under pack because I didn't not not a sweatshirt to be found. You don't know where anything is. No, I do know everything is but I just I didn't put a sweatshirt in because first of all I'm packing in the morning just before we go because yeah hectic.	
2	Well, you know where the clothes probably are still in the fucking Dryer no.	
3	Well, exactly. Well the because they're never not the point is is we had a lot of reusing of closed this weekend is a new Conway all and by the way it	
4	Green, yeah, it wasn't a lot of nobody smelled.	
3	I mean, I'm sure but they always knew you were drunk.	
4	Anyway, three sheets to the wind and I smell in the pits ugly.	
3	But the point is you make do with what you got. It's going to be.	
4	All right, I hate folding clothes and doing laundry and I'll bring a lot of times what happens is will bring the laundry up and the basket just sits there full of clothes like a lot of people dump him on a chair on the bed and then just move them to the floor and it was just then eventually it's like you need to rewash them. They're so rich Wrinkled. So AE Dimock says changing betting after those fucking idiots piss themselves, which is another twist. So if you like wake up and we'll let your kid gets sick or pees himself and you have to like change sheets or like do laundry in the middle the night that sucks.	
3	So, yes, we definitely have that situation a situation to where that's what going through that. But yeah, it's really tough to like every more every other morning or whatever having to change his sheets having to follow like it.	
4	Don't even do it. Just throw it out.	
3	They're expensive and they're not like a mini baby bells.	
4	They're expensive Halima Maya 2.0 says fuck kids socks and where they disappear to so people have told me about like dryer traps where like there's like spots and dryers whir socks like gets sucked into the crevasse. I believe it but I don't have any proof.	
3	What are you doing China? Just you're squeezing the camp.	
4	It is it is tricky. Shelby Tellier says dishes and laundry. Literally Never End which we talked about Paula policy world's biggest CFL fans his laundry just never ends.

2	Hi. You don't have Ramen dishes. I don't I don't give a shit.	
3	Shit about you know, I do we do dishes 24 hours a day, but I don't there's something kind of very I disagree 1 million plus I'll do dishes all day long and like putting into a dishwasher. Well Nate is agreeing with you be like useless fuck dishes for up until I was what 32 didn't have a dishwasher?	
4	No. Yeah.	
3	Great same so doing dishes like actually doing dishes from when you're 17, or whatever College to yeah being 32. That will make you fucking love doing dishes when it's like wait. So all I do is I just put them in this thing close it up and then open it up like a like an hour later you saying doing the dishes when you have a dishwasher is a lot easier than doing.	
4	This is when you don't but that's not really doing the dishes know when you have a dishwasher.	
2	It's not doing the dishes. I think it's so I watched and I have a dishwasher.	
4	You're right. So right I do that and I only have a one basin sink which sucks a to basin sink will change your life. Life, yeah, really? Well, I had it once it's fucking mind blowing because you can put the shit you not dealing with too much on one side. And then you use this one of the basin's to fucking deal your everyday stuff. And there's some rinse these it's really great. There's that that movie that break up with Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston where there's a part where like they're having an argument in the beginning and and he's complaining about having to do the decisions and she's like I want you to do the dishes. He's I want you to undo heels.	
2	She goes I want you to want to do the dishes she goes	
4	Why would I want to do the dishes obviously her point is like I want you to want to like help out around the house and stuff. But I've I mean that fucking quote. Why would I want to do the dishes really sticks with me? Because doing the dishes sucks shit.	
2	I will agree that maybe I prefer to do dishes to do laundry and folding laundry.	
4	Exactly.	
2	That's what when I'm filming laundry.	
4	I can like watch a show. Yeah, right when I was unemployed. I would be like alright fucking kids. I put the kid to nap. I'm gonna fucking watch.

4	Of course, he does. It's a it's a mess. All right, so cleaning up so case usually am alive. I've earlier wanted to mention this and I don't have daughters and this makes me glad I don't have daughters. She says where we going with the cleaning their fucking bedrooms is the worst. She says the mold growing food crusted towels used to listen to me towels used his toilet paper. She has a think a 13 year old and a 10 year old hair clogged sinks sniffing underwear to see if it's clean or dirty and bloody pads not wrapped in toilet paper in trash cans. Oh my God, this is making me angry typing all this out.	
2	It's making me angry. Dang it. No one better. Tell me girls aren't gross.	
4	I don't even know how to respond to that.	
3	We're going to take about 40 to 45 minutes to cover this thing. First of all food. What's food doing bedroom?	
2	What do you mean? You never had food in your bedroom when your kids get older they grab the food and then bring it up to their room and they're like, I don't want to fucking deal with you people not in your house because you're fucking Google fucking good.	
3	You're gonna go go.	
2	You know, what wake me up when she's 13.	
3	I will I will I got it looks like sleep for years really beca.	
2	Great.	
4	Third oldest rowing. What's how well this is this beca great.	
2	13 says cleaning up food off the floor.	
4	Whether it's Jack's. Oh my God, or the paste where my to you.	
3	The paste I don't know. He's just like pieces probably like oh, yeah, I did and I put it on the floor and come out of his mouth when he threw it on the floor while y'all I called, uh meeting all done.	
4	I loathe cleaning up more than anything.	
2	So look you're saying there's no food in your kids bedrooms.	
3	No, we don't need answers. We don't it's a rule. No because of that because of just that I can't wait what?	
2	I'm sorry, we're gonna bring mergent.	
4	We're going to bring the murders and shoes in the house going to bring blow your mind fucking stupid to not wear your shoes. We're going to bring mergers and Acquisitions on the air and he's going to tell me where fucking secret a secret food stashes, but cleaning up I did I tell you I did say this. I can't even believe I read that Bloody pads comment out. It made me the Blake's milk. I'm were not there not there yet. We'll have to go have to revisit will do a puberty episode in a year or two, but they're them already.	
3	The gun is in my mouth their bedroom, but they definitely have to they're asked to clean the rooms every day. And they do an okay job of it. But the not bloody pads, so I ruined the kitchen the food on the floor just in general just like oh, what was this? Oh used to be like a is this a grape if I can't have no rights like AB.	
4	Yeah, so nasty. So under the couch shit that ends up under the couch. I don't even want to this is disgusting. So Daniel and Potter says getting his give the came up at clean up after themselves and get them to clean their nasty room is his worst parenting chore so our situation a little bit different because Our downstairs is like kind of like not a loft but like kind of a big open space and there aren't separate rooms and we've tried to divide it so that there's a section where their bedroom that they share is one area. And then there's like a little couch with the TV but the whole place is just it's just absolute like right now, it's like my wife any time she walks in the house. She says this place is a fucking disaster and like seven out of ten times no fun six out of ten times. That's true. Most of the time is just like chill is Not that big a deal relax downstairs is almost always a disaster like every toy they have they pull out. It's everywhere if they eat something down there. They don't bring it back up fucking yogurt containers mini-muffin bags and all that shit fucking goldfish crumbs everywhere absolute it's really hard and telling them to like go down and clean their room.	
2	It's such a big space.	
4	It's like almost too much to ask the king for them. It's like overwhelming and for us we kind of understand like there's no real specific. It between it so it's not so much like go to they go to your room. It's like go downstairs. So it's a little bit harder.	
3	We basically ran some we've talked about this. We weaponized TV.	
4	Tellin ya if you want we do that ya gotta do your thing.	
3	And then I owe the thing that does work at least has worked for some of the kids actually works quite often is when I walk in and I'll tell my kids to clean up and I'll be like who cleaned us up you didn't clean up because you're just yeah that couldn't	
2	Possible this off who tell me who I did that I did. I'm like, there's no no.	
3	No, of course, you couldn't have done something amazing like the fucking there's no way you know, and it's like a little game we play I enjoy it.	
4	So I enjoyed it. Yeah, a lot of people complain about wiping the the high chair down.	
3	That's the grossest thing.	
4	Oh because it's like porridge just say everything comes out. Well, first of all, if you have fabric on that high chair. Oh God, you gotta get your you made a mistake me to fuck you made a big mistake if you're not fast.	
3	If not, you're not using the Ikea high chair that was invented by God himself. Oh was it?	
4	Yeah, because God and Faith day. He invented the Ikea high chair.	
3	These guys have been through enough. Let me just give him a high chair that you can easily wipe down and is the best thing that's ever been invented.	
4	I don't have an Ikea high chair, but I don't like that idea white. I know I assume I can picture it there at Ikea if you go to eat it at Ikea there a dyke when I met my next lunch break so, Texas Margaret, Cleaning up vomit is just the worst. I mean look, I don't care if you're a parent or not. The I don't want to hear about vomit.	
3	I don't want anything to do with it. I just told people about puke the pupil episode of people who people yeah, they're like, yeah. Should I have one people you're making I told them about you and they said what does he do have a puke blanket?	
2	And then you say no the article about me and they said that follow him.	
4	That's what they fucking said. Don't lie to me now. Ya puke carpet.	
2	No use a fucking bucket or a trash pan. You don't have a dedicated piece that you you you fucking use it. You gotta get it. It's not dedicated. It's your fucking vomit bull house it a dedicated. What else do you use it? We have as much out of it.	
4	You fucking suck makes me sick. So another big category was the diapers potty training poop situation. So obviously terrible There's one of my least favorite things ever, which I had to do this weekend because my kids still not fucking fully potty-trained. He only sleeps in an overnight diaper. Yeah, but he only shits in the diaper. He won't shit in the potty. You haven't cracked that code yet. That is we have a Diaper Genie still.	
3	Yep.	
4	Nothing makes me more nervous than first of all. Yeah. No just stepping on the pedal or I made that.	
2	Yeah, you did make that me happens to me all the time. You get your whiff of that fucking cylinder of fucking repulsive.

3	No, he will be for in January.	
4	And yeah, that's that know. That was normal.	
2	I'm not saying it's abnormal.	
4	Thermal I'm saying it's sucking Mike relax, your kid is fine. But the worst thing ever is when you have to change the Diaper Genie out and you have to carry the sack of diapers. Nothing is more terrifying if that thing fucking breaks. I used to live in apartment. And when we live in Raleigh, it's not that much. I had to walk down like four flights to carry that thing fucking absolutely terrifying of this thing fucking brakes on the stairwell.	
2	Yes, there's an elevator but look there's a lot of fucking break. It's fucking plastic. This should break. Times when you're changing it, you accidentally poked a hole in it and you don't remember that when you're pulling it out later shut up. You know what you don't think it's never broken on somebody the Diaper Genie ya know the bag from it. Yeah. I know. No, it's definitely 100 broken on people. Yeah. It's a thing that and those people were drunk it scares me.	
4	All right, everybody who's had the Diaper Genie bag break on them. Yeah send it to Pete send the diapers to fucking Pete.	
3	You know, the only thing that might have happened is that there's not enough plastic as you at the very end.	
4	Yay. Had a fuckin eat, right?	
2	Like a tiny knot and it but imagine the knives lips open and all this shitty diapers fall out on the floor and I don't want imagine I would just leave I would just get in the car and fucking drive off a cliff like thumb and Louise that's when you that's when you pull out the old dad sander, I'm gonna get serious for ever gonna get cigarettes.

3	I always have my my son who's 5 now. He's like Dad. I went poop. Can you wipe me? I'm like you wipe first. And then yeah, you'll come and do the reconnaissance Recon and it was great. It all worked and I was like, let me stay cast.

Genie is the worst and this is what I'm talking about and I know guarantees are paid, so they're nervous. And for Diaper Genie afford a 4G, I think Debora diniz just a catch-all. It's like tissue at this point or Kleenex, right it just or Coke.	
3	No, I'm just saying them being on the same side as you for your oh, please everybody is scared of emptying the Diaper Genie.

3	Watch out baby bottles constantly putting them in packing the diaper bag.	
4	I remember as being the biggest fucking so we still have to pack a bag like for my toddler when we go places like just snacks and shit and like diapers and wipes just in case or underwear and every time I go to pack the fucking Fox backpack or whatever all the snacks from last time are still in there like that. Every meeting them they eat whatever you like. If you go somewhere you end up getting them food. It's just a bunch of fucking old shit or like Ziploc bags full of Just go through them in ground in the dust. It just benches manhandling so many times or apples that just shouldn't all my God. No, they're not even apples anymore, but there wasn't baby bottles thing.	
2	I remember like seeing that in movies and even seeing my friends do it where like you they boil them. We didn't really do that. What I remember why we didn't like boil our shit. You know, I'm not I mean, yes, I like sterilized otherwise babies, but then just fucking washing them and then there's constantly like churning them.

3	What about it when your kids in between age when you gotta bring the street? Yeah. No the kid, but sometimes that's a lifesaver though, but if you like because you know, they don't whine and you're not going to carry them but you gotta like carry that piece of gear.	
4	Yes. It can be definitely be a half and if you're not if you're not super smart, you don't have a super slim. Yeah, like an umbrella. Yeah, get full of yeah tiny one. So we bring our sometimes because we have like the pipe dream that the hammer might fall asleep. Like if we go somewhere and he's tired stroller. We have a big one that we've had but we don't we have to write so we have the big one and we have the umbrella one that you can fold up really easily and doesn't take up any space. We still do bring the stroller not every time but like as you know, it's going to be like, I don't want to walk anymore.	
2	Carry me and it's like fuck I don't want to do that.	
4	Just get in the fucking stroller makes it easier and I told that story last week with the kid he flew out of the Roller, and I only reason I put a minute was because we had to move really quickly.	
3	Well, right so but definitely three to five but my son luckily is in the zone for we've stopped in the Fun Zone. We stopped even bringing the stroller look at you and now the scary transition. That's what all he does is whine and I'm like, you know, what no Bakugan man up know what Bakugan that's a show he watches. Don't worry. I'm not going to look it up.
