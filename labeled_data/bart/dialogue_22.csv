1	Hello, beautiful tribe and welcome to ancient wisdom Today podcast. I love you so much. It is so wonderful to love all of you all over the world. Some of you I've met you come to some of my fans and my my meet and greets and have come into to learn Shamanism and about your own self and what your own power and some of you haven't and I've seen you in the dream world. And you know, it doesn't matter. If you haven't met we haven't met in person. I'd want you to know I love you and we are connected and if you are here part of this tribe, we were definitely connected in heaven and will be in the many lives to come and also here on Earth as well. So I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you and I acknowledge you and I'm thankful. Well for you and being on this planet and incarnating at this time in our Evolution because right now we are about to set the roof on fire and take it to a whole nother plane of Consciousness because what we are doing is forging new thinking into the minds of human beings by not tolerating lower. For thinking in our friends and our family and our loved ones and in people in general, I mean just the other day, you know, I was at GameStop and I was getting this video game for my nephew and the woman behind the counter, you know, she was saying that she wasn't so smart. She was so dumb and I said nah, I'm sorry. I just I will not sit here in front of the presence of a child of God a powerful. Being if you believe God or not and listen to you speak against yourself in incorrect way. You are powerful and smart. Do you believe that? She said well, sometimes I said, no I said claim it now right now claim it because it's never a sometimes and it's never a maybe and even when I say that I get emotional saying that because it's never a son times and it's never a maybe. And I'm so so sorry that you had to go through an idea in your mind from something that happened to you that you would ever think. It's sometimes or maybe are not at all. You know, I was just talking to my friend today was very emotional conversation. I think you've heard me talk about it before no my me I get emotional at times but it's good as according to Danielle page me getting in feeling these emotions are really good and she was talking to a friend of mine and he you know, he was touching story with me. I don't know if you if you listen to the episode that I did on signs about, you know, being able to pay attention to science it is The mic swaggered such a beautiful soul totem long time ago. Don't go to go camping with my friend don't go off the grid with my friend because it was going to be a horrible death and it was going to change his life forever and he's going to end up in tattoos and end up in prison and so forth. And so, you know, he called me today from prison. I accepted his his call from prison. You know, he had said to me the last time he saw me when he was not in prison when he got out on parole. I went to go visit him and he was staying at this motel with this girl friend of his and his kind of, you know, just catching up and he was doing some rap songs and he was performing them and saying them to me and sharing them with me and you know, and I said well now that you're out, you know, what are you doing with your life then he said, you know. I'm working for a construction company and I'm doing you know odd jobs here and there and so forth. And so I said that's great as if you ever need anything financially or whatever. It may be I'm there for you a hundred percent and I love you and he goes I love you too. And he goes, you know, I wish I would have listened to you when you told me not to take that trip. You're right. I did end up in prison and I did lose my mind and everything, you know, and I said, yes, I just just listen to me and you know, and I'll guide you but you have to listen to me, you know. Because I was pythia in my other life time. I was the Oracle of Delphi. I see things very clearly and you know, he wouldn't talk for a while and then one day I was at home and I was doing things and I was out and about and I was going to pick up some things for a friend and I just stopped in the middle of the street and like grabbed my phone and called him and was like, are you okay? Something's wrong. Are you? Okay? And he said yeah. No, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. he told me today that it you know, when I asked him if he was okay, he was actually in the middle of about to perform an armed robbery and he said that I knew he's like you knew that I was going to do it and you called me and you checked on me and I wasn't being honest and he's like and he's like why didn't I be honest I could have just told you the truth, you know and And he didn't he didn't tell me the truth and it's unfortunate because it ended him going back to prison and now he has a longer sentence. He has 12 years now and you know, I think about a lot on how we are as human beings and I was telling him, you know, I'm working out a program with his prison to be able to go there and offer. Versus to do workshops for the inmates and so forth. So I'm in conversation about that and that really makes me happy. But the thing is, you know, they wouldn't be these types of situations in life. And that's what I was thinking about today. That's why I got emotional a second ago because there wouldn't be these types of situations if we were in a system that supported us to see See the greatest potential of who we can become and who we are. I mean, there's so many people on this planet who don't even love themself or see how beautiful they are how smart they are intelligent creative. They are how loved they are. There's so many people on this planet who don't even hold strong to them saying they're smart or that things come to them easily or that life can happen for them. You know, they'll II mean just the other day. I was on my Instagram and person wrote, you know, my Instagram you go to my Instagram page. I have little boxes that I do and then I after that I put like a neon light word in neon light because I love bright things. I love bright colors. I think that's my ET nature like things that glow and brighten the luminescent colors and so forth and you know, one of the ones that I put up was winning and someone wrote, you know, will not never winning, you know. And it's the idea of saying I never I never is such a long time.	
3	It's like eternity.	
1	It's like we have to really pay attention to what we are putting into the universe what we're putting into life. What are we saying? You know, I'll never I'll never you know, or like, you know, things don't happen for I mean like you're basically saying this is my reality and I'm accepting it and I'm claiming it and this is the whole thing as I was thinking about my friend Mike because thinking wow, you know, he probably had in his mind the same exact thing and that's what led him down that path and how many other people on our planet are in that same predicament people who are you know, alcoholics or people who have just gotten to a place where they just keep, you know sabotaging. Every opportunity that comes their way are people who are you know constantly having poverty Consciousness in scarcity Consciousness where they every time money comes at leaves and every time they get ahead they fall down and you know something they build something and then someone comes and tears it away or rips it away and it's all because of the way we interact with our power with ourselves our power. I loves our power is so important. It and you got to start with your children. You got to start with your children. I mean, you got it. Like I saw my nieces and nephew there visiting the visiting for Guadalajara and I saw my and they said Tio Tio we love you so much and I said, I love you too. And you're so smart and you're so beautiful and you're intelligent and you make anything happen and beautiful things are always showing up for you and you're so you're so healthy and you have such vibrancy in you and so much full of light and so much creativity. Cavity and you know one of my friends you know, she she heard me and she looked at me she said oh my God, I love that you do that for the children.	
3	I said, why wouldn't I we have to start now we have to make sure that their fortified that they are is not one ounce of Doubt of how wonderful they are.	
1	How beautiful they are how smart they are. How capable they are. Psychic they are how in tune they are how everything we have to find every word that we can use because every word is a building block of foundation that will either launch them to see the power and creativity that they have and the in the divineness that they are or it will not and and we're never too old.	
3	Okay, like we're not too old to start with ourselves now.	
1	I mean, I grew up I didn't have that I can tell you right now. I got you're an idiot. You're stupid. You're never going to amount to anything and people aren't going to like you because the color of your skin people hate black people. You know, I got I was told that I was people called me, you know gay because I was feminine even though it was not you know, but if he's like, you know every single thing, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if you know a lot of those things that were being said were just there. Really strengthen me, you know and I mean they were there to strengthen me but I'm saying strengthen me in the sense of like being clear about who I am, right? And so, you know a lot of those things which in it took me a while to figure out especially, you know, when I was going through my training is to understand that like everything my stepmom would say to me. I mean, she even told me things like every time I wanted to do something she would say, oh they're going to laugh at you. Everyone's gonna laugh at you. They're gonna beat you up in there laugh at you and I remember seeing this movie Carrie and they kept the mother keep going on.	
3	They're gonna laugh at you. They gonna laugh at you. They're gonna laugh at you. Oh, they're gonna love you. Everyone's gonna laugh at you. You can't go you can't go.	
1	I was like, oh my god. Did my dad my stepmom stay up at night and watch that show and decide what she was going to say to me. Is she like plagiarizing this the scary movie this very Hora thick film that don't go watch it. It's not worth it. But the point is is that if I can almost like she was literally saying everything she could to take me to hell it was like every time she said something awake came on me and then another way and then another way and then another way and whereas you look like I was standing on the floor and I felt like my waist was in the floor, but my legs were in that getting pulled down the hell and I mean I literally was like more and more Darkness every time she would say it every time she would say it every time I Remember would say it, you know and I mean growing up with a Hawaiian Hawaiian Japanese Filipino family is not I mean, I don't know if you have Filipino families, but my family is one side of the family is Japanese and Hawaiian. The other side is from the Philippines. And when you have a Filipino family, first of all, let me explain to you. You are a servant in your home to a Filipino family. Like there's not a moment where I could sit and rest myself without my entities or my mom. My stepmom who's my mom right would say?	
3	Hey brah. So watch you going to clean the kitchen. I thought the kitchen was clean.	
1	No, you don't you think the kitchen is clean while you don't check them.	
3	Now you go over there and clean the kitchen.	
1	I'll give you lickin's bra and I go clean the kitchen. Okay. So why do you have so much energy?	
3	Why don't you go clean the basin's 200, you know what, you know, what else you need to clean go over there and take the clothes at it. But we have a housekeeper. Oh, so you think the housekeeper gonna do everything we say do you go in the kitchen right now and you go clean the kitchen then you go. Clean the Basin and then you go to take the clothes and you can follow all the clothes and put them away. Okay, bro, and after you gonna finish that you better go do your homework? Okay. Are you going to get good lickin's tonight?	
1	It's like never a moment. Never moment. Oh, what are you doing?	
3	I'm resting are you you have so much time to rest. You can come in the kitchen and help me with the Adobo chicken. I mean like really but Auntie would be sitting in the living room. She's like, she's like dude good. I'm like what Aunty she goes choking me too kind. I got Auntie what kind you like? She goes the kind over there. So I go to pick up the controller. And she said okay come bring me the controller now mine you she's only but a couple steps away from it and I'm all the way on the other side of the house, but I become the house servant and it's like a bra. You know what you can get me give me some water fund refrigerator over there. Okay, Aunty you like anything else? No, but you're gonna check them out. Okay. What now? I gotta check out over there in my bag. I wouldn't leave one. One number phone guy. I'm going to call him later. Okay fine I go over there and get your bag. What you want? Okay, nothing else. Okay go. Okay go already. Alright, great. Thank you.	
1	Can I go get my and my pal my power which in Hawaiian means finish you pal?	
3	Okay pal, how are you pal for now bra go relax.	
1	And then I go relax and here comes my stepmom.	
3	Also you like relax. You have so much time on your hands. So, you know, what you workin. Do. You know what you can you can make them over there go there and take this thing from inside the car and go bring them aside in the house. Okay, because you know what? I want to make some fresh point tonight and we're going to have all kinds. Kinds of you know, Kahlua Kalua Pig and you know all this kind of stuff and you know what you're going to help me with it bra and if you don't you're going to get good lickin's migrate, everything is like I can never rest in my home. And the thing is is that when you grow up in that kind of family, you just like go go go go go and then on top of that you have the people calling you like names like a by you won by your heart when like, which means are you a faggot?	
1	Are you gay? You know and then everything was like a comet everything was like a and then Hawaii I was known as hop Apollo because my stepmom is Hawaiian, but still I'm black because of my father's side, which is from Africa right from Ghana. So then you have and then of course no one wanted to recognize my mother side because my stepmoms in the picture. So that was just out of the box and so I would be called hop-up Ebola which means half black for whatever reason and every time the lights went off in Hawaii.	
3	Everyone goes are bra a broad open. Miles for the like income, you know, it's like really really okay.	
1	And so, you know, it was challenging dealing just with that with the intensity of that all the time all and when I say all the time, I mean like I mean my sister and I make jokes about it to this day, but literally, I don't think I've ever had a moment of pause to enjoy something for myself in my home without someone coming up behind me or my ENT or Auntie Panini or you know, my auntie Alana, you know, any of my auntie's I had many entities and and you know, some of my auntie's are like nails we say in Hawaiian. So it's like she's Nails, right which means like she's so thick and so like like intense and so strong and can blow up any second. So you just have to kind of like walk on eggshells. And the other thing is too is like in Hawaii when you when you do something let's say for instance. Okay, let's say it my friends are at my house. Okay, and I do something I get in trouble. Okay, and then I go to my friend's house and them and their Mata the their mom says, oh, I want to hear from your NTU.	
3	When you know Uncle Lionel was was fishing over there by the docks and he won't tell us about how you want to make one quick one big problem for your family.	
1	You know what I'm going to give you a licking and so they said pop my face or pop my ear and then I go to go with my friends. We want to get shave ice with the bubble gun and I go to the Shave Ice place and the woman, you know, she knows oh Auntie momma.	
3	Well you are to you what you know, you got to shave ice today when you one bad boy, like everybody knows your business, right?	
1	So you deal with that and then you have people calling you names like making fun of you or like me or more. Set mom constantly telling you you're an idiot or you're stupid or dumb or this you're not and after a while.	
3	You start to think what am I stupid?	
1	Am I dumb am I these things and so it's not just me who's gone to that many people go through that on the earth and sometimes people are still going through that right now.	
3	Even some people right now who are who are who are who are in this tribal Circle right now that I'm looking at right now and my mind's Vision right now.	
1	I'm looking at you and you're still letting that show up in your life.	
2	Abuse right.	
1	That's abuse my Hawaiian family by Filipino family. They were abusive and I it took me a while to figure out what abuse was, you know, I thought you know abuse was just me getting you know beat which is also something I went through but abuse also comes in many forms and we have to be able to recognize it and isolate it and eliminate it and be done with it quickly. We have no time for any abuse in our life because when we allow abuse what we're basically Basically saying to ourselves is you're not you are not lovable. And if you feel that you're not lovable and you keep hearing that over and over again, and it doesn't even have to come as words. Sometimes that I'm not lovable can come through someone's actions towards you and someone's emotions that are unspoken. Like someone could be in the room ignoring you deliberately, you know withholding from you or doing things to you that aren't even like blatantly in your face, but Shanley felt because of their energy and that also makes you feel like you're not lovable because a lovable person doesn't get that kind of treatment and so we have created a lot of people on planet Earth to feel unlovable including ourselves and we have to take responsibility for that. We have to take responsibility for the fact that we keep prolonging abuse every time we won't commit to something that we are that's beautiful. Wonderful. Gracious loving supportive nurturing profound creative geniusness abundant prosperous human being right kings and queens Majesty's of great honor meaning that I'm not going to say, I'm not smart. I'm not going to say well, I think I'm not I mean, maybe I'm smart know, there's no maybes there's no I don't need to think about it. I don't need to sit there and ponder it and I definitely don't need 20,000 people. Coming the Roman telling me it before I believe it.	
3	See that's the state.	
1	That's the mistake we make because we go and we wait and we wait and we wait and we think one day they're going to tell us that were lovable one day. They're going to say to us that we're smart one day. They're going to tell us how creative we are. Our that we can do anything and that we're powerful and that we're going to succeed and then that's when I'm going to go out there and live my life. Well, guess what that day may never come my stepmom never told me all the way up to the point of her death that I was something special or one. Teufel and delightful all the love that I gave every time I kissed her and she pushed away every time I gave love to my Hawaiian family and they were just hard on me. I think good morning, Auntie. Okay.	
3	Did you go over there with your auntie and practice the hula, you know, we have one loo out today and you know, you you didn't you didn't you didn't Crush that the Taro Roots so you can make the POI.	
1	So the people going to come for from the law because why because my grandfather lo and behold had a travel company and the way the travel company worked was instead of putting them in hotels, which is what you should do. He would take their money and put them in my dad's house because my dad had this big house, but guess what they would overflow the house. So I would have to give up my room and go sleep on the couch in the living room. And so the thing is is that there was never a moment. It was never like. Oh, we really appreciate you giving up your room. We love you so much. You're so caught you're so kind with a generous kind person you are it was like expected of you Elders always have the last word in my home. It's very traditional and if you come from a Filipino family I can tell you when your entities pushing her lips out. She's pointing to something she wants you to get she's not like saying like, oh, by the way, she's pushing her lips out to show you where the thing is that she wants you to fetch when you're sleeping and it's 3 o'clock in the morning and you get this scream of your name through the house because one of your entities are your mom or your dad or your uncle or anyone who's happened to be in the house at the time because in Hawaiian Filipino family the house is like a revolving door. Okay, and it's like the smells from like a double chicken to like kimchi to like everything. You can smell like the smell of seafood. I mean there are times where I walk in the house. I thought I was going to throw up all over myself because I was just like what is this smell something new? It's a whole new thing and then my grandfather he was big on his crab and the making the lobster and like, you know, and then I had to spend time, you know, making the POI all the time and we and my grandfather had to travel agency. So he always made us do luaus so we had to learn. Earn the hukala. We had to learn all of the Hawaiian dancing and the hula and we had to learn how to make the Kalua Pig the old-fashioned way where we put it with the rock salt and you put them in underneath the banana leaves and you put them in the earth, you know, and you wait and then you bring them out and then you shred the meat and you know, and then you can put like on a plate you can put that with some like, you know some poor boy. And of course we had the Filipino side we had some of the double chicken and we had like all kinds of stuff like I mean the chicken chow mein. I mean the list would I was on and you know, you have the food and then everyone you do the ceremony that I had to go. So I had to get up at like 4:00 in the morning. I would have to do all the Lays with my auntie. You don't make one mistake in a Hawaiian Filipino family. So you doing the lathe and then you make the leis and then after the leis and then you put them in the box and then everyone has that if you're depending on how many people are coming from out of town to do the luau and then you have to do the dance with your auntie in the morning and she's very strict about the dance. Because you have to have everyone has to have the dance perfect. So you have to practice the hula over and over and again and then you go help your aunt your uncle make the Kalua Pig and then you go help in the kitchen and then you go do whatever chores that the elders want you to do. I mean literally they could have me scratched or as far as I'm concerned because that's how much they were putting us to slave work. But the point I'm making is is that there is no tolerance for abuse and what I realized is that when someone is calling you a name and someone is playing. Things to do. There are people right now who are in this tribal Circle who are listening right now who are still putting up with abuse? And I'm going to say this to you and I'm going to say this to you and I'm going to say this directly to you with love in my heart because I love you. You have no right to receive abuse except abuse or allow abuse anything that is not coming from unconditional love and that is supportive and nurturing and lifting you and shifting you and coming from a place of sweetness and kindness for the fact that You are created and that you are a child of God if anyone is calling you names putting you down making fun of you mocking you, okay, withholding sex from you putting any kind of restraints or restrictions upon you because they aren't comfortable with it or because they don't get it. And so they're going to put it down and make fun of you is not coming from love. I don't care if they tell you. They're sorry. I don't care if they tell you that they did. No, everyone knows the difference between what feels loving and what doesn't feel loving even a child knows the difference between what is loving and what is not loving don't let them fool you. Okay, if someone is acting in an abusive way towards you my thing to tell you is to bless them with love and get the hell out of there because the more you decide to stay in the abuse. You are telling your mind your spirit your emotions your Being that you are not lovable and that you deserve this and that you have to endure this and then you'll create all these lies. I call them the in between life and the in between lines look like this. It's like, oh, I know he's very abusive. I know she's very abusive to me. But you know what? I love them so much and I know they're going to come out of this and they just told me they're going to work on themselves and they going to get help and they're going to seek someone and they're going to this and they're going to that it's all nonsense. Okay, it's smoking mirrors. That's exactly what it is. It's called it's called bait and switch. It means I'm going to tell you that I'm going to do these things but I plan on doing absolutely nothing and if we say we argue this time you're going to argue we're going to argue again. If you're fighting to the point where you're screaming and calling your the names where you feel like you literally a feel like you're in one of these crazy films and you're jumping out of cars and chasing each other down the streets and doing these types of things you are and what we call a very very very very very very very very abusive relationship and it's time to cut that cord. I don't care if the person buys you flowers. I've Seen It All Before I don't care if they tell you they're so sorry that they did this to you and they love you and they don't mean to do this. I know they don't mean to do this, but they're doing it and that's all that matters.	
3	I don't care if they did it yesterday.	
1	That's enough to say goodbye. There is no more tolerance for abuse tribe. We will not be able to go through this dark period on Earth for the next 15 years cycle that we have to go through if we put up with abuse.	
3	There's no tolerance from abuse.	
1	And if your children are abusing you and that means you're abusing you because your children are reflections of yourself.	
3	So if your children are abusing you, then you need to pipe down sit down meditate and ask yourself. Where do you feel like you deserve to be punished or be the better that you're the bad mom or dad and if your person your spouse or your boyfriend or your girlfriend is abusing you that's because you're abusing you.	
1	It's time to wise up.	
3	It's time to wise up there is you know, there is no room for abuse and there's never going to be room for abuse and I don't care how you slice it.	
1	I don't care how many times you but, you know try to to, you know, get into a space where you want to convince yourself.	
3	You know that you are going to move through this this this way, it's just not okay, and it's not. Okay because You are basically saying again and again and again and again and again and again and again to yourself that you're not lovable and that is enough for you to give that message to God because if you're willing to accept abuse and say I'm not lovable then you're basically saying God, I don't love you because God created you to be you as you are. Not you as you are.	
1	Comfortable because you're in a relationship with someone who can't deal with all the other parts of you, but they can only deal with 20 or 10% or 15% of you maybe even thirty percent.	
3	Sorry. It's a no-go. They can't deal with you a hundred percent. It's a no-go if they're calling you names and mocking you. Uh, it's a no-go they need to check themselves.	
1	They need to get correct.	
3	They need to get help and it's not for you to jump in and try to be there counselor or their healer. I don't care. You say I have healing powers Shaman dirt. I can heal them.	
1	No because it changes the dimension of the relationship from a power struggle and makes the other person feel that they're lower than you and you're higher than them because you have the ability to help them. It makes it come off arrogant and it makes them want to fight and hurt you more because they're hurting inside. Look if someone is abusing you it's because they're hurting inside. My stepmom was hurting. My dad was hurting my aunt's were hurting all of them were hurting. Okay, and that's why They did the horrific things that they did to a beautiful innocent child as myself who is Angelic and loving and nurturing and ET and Jaguar Type and full of love and full of laughter and color and spend and energy and sensuality and playfulness and laughter and Discovery and a cute little smile with beautiful big eyes that says, I love you everyone. I love you and no matter what I said and no matter how I told them I loved them.	
3	They did everything they could.	
1	To get me not to love them and I still kept loving them but I realized that they were abusive and that they were in pain and that they were sick and now I'm going to explain to you what sick means. Okay, when someone my love is operating in a field of Consciousness where they cannot come from a place of Love they have to say nasty things to you. They have to spout out of their mouth curses and At T and they have to act out of character. They have to call you out of your name and and they have to to say things to you too. True to bring you down or to just yell at you in general. They are sec. Okay, there are flus that happen on the physical level. Okay that are cumulative of certain viruses bacterias and you know accumulation of free radicals in the system that break down the immune system that can cause you to pick up one of these viruses and bacterias and all kinds of things that are out there.	
3	Okay on the physical level. Yes, but there are also spiritual thicknesses. And you got to be mindful of them. Now.	
1	What is a spiritual sickness a spiritual sickness is someone who cannot stop speaking about negative things.	
3	They're sick my darlings. Be careful what you listen to you might catch it. It's a virus of sickness piss parasitic energy inside of their energetic field as a shaman. We see them as parasites. viruses bacterias fun guys that are not the good kind	
1	Okay, when I say fungi, I'm talking like mold things that will corrupt you things that will that will the imprint you with poisonous ideas and emotional ideas and feelings that are poisoned when riddled with viruses and bacterias that when they open their mouth you start feeling the effects of their that poison in that energy. That is why that is why you must see them as sick. You must not react to them. Because the moment you react the moment you come back with some flashy word or some witty comment or you want to debate them or it fight them or prove to them that they're wrong. You have just taken in the poison.	
3	Mhm. That's right. Yes, that means that if someone is arguing with me and I engage that argument I am now accepting the	
1	Poison, uh-huh. He spirit always gives you a moment to pause.	
3	There's a beautiful pause in life a beautiful pause a moment to just pause sometimes someone may say something to you and ask you a question.	
1	You don't need to answer the question right away.	
3	You can say hmm this brings some interesting thoughts to my mind.	
1	So profound I want to give you the right information or I want to give you the right expression that is in that I feel From what you're saying in the only way I can do that is I need to think upon this I might need to sleep on this take as much time as you want to my darlings there times people will say something to me in an interview and I think it's funny because you know, my friend Gwyneth. She taught me something very valuable interviews. I asked her one day. We were sitting in our kitchen and I said when I said sis, what is what do you do when people ask you questions in interviews that are just completely Like something they shouldn't be asking you she goes. I answer it the way I want to answer it. Sometimes I don't even answer the question. I just answer a different question and pretend they ask me a different question. They have no idea. What's really going on.	
3	I thought oh my God, bye-bye. God. I think she's got it. I think she's got it I sit back. I said she said what's going on? I said I have to take in your words. I need a moment.	
1	I need a moment so that my mind can digest what you just said sis. She said yes, you know many times. I've done films and people have made little comments and things that I didn't like I don't answer their questions. You don't need to answer their questions. She said to me I said mmmm. I gotta put my Mind on this I need to get up and take a little walk you said okay, and I get up and I walk past her kitchen into the living room. I just pace around the living room and come back. She said she said she said what's going on she starts laughing I said I had to digest that tell me more. And so the next time I was in I was in Sweden in Stockholm and it was good that I had that conversation with her. She is very smart smart cookie that one, you know, and I'm sitting in Stockholm and I'm sitting	
3	being in an interview with this guy and he's asking me so how much money do you have in your bank account?	
1	And I remember what what she said and I looked at him and I said, you know, it's so beautiful when we think about prosperity and how we can collectively start, you know, understanding how we can start bringing that in for each other by the way that we operate in business and the way we operate in life and how we deal with money within Cells and then how we bring that to the greater public as a as a way that we treat other people so they can learn through show of example, and he said that wasn't the question that I asked Shaman I said, oh it wasn't he said no, but let's move on and huh.	
3	It worked.	
1	I realized that just because someone asked me a question. I don't need to jump to I don't need to respond just because you feel like you need a response there times when people will try you to get me into a question and notice I said try because that's what they do. They try to get me to answer a question. I simply look at them and I smile and I said hmm that without that is a question indeed and I'm going to have to take some time and think about that. I'm going to I'm going to sleep on it. I noticed that when I sleep on things I have a much more clearer perspective.	
3	Shall I get back to you in two days about that?	
1	Two days without be will that be okay? If I get back to you in two days?	
3	They're like, oh sure. Yeah definitely take as much time as you need. I'm like a thank you so much. Appreciate it. I don't need to jump. I'm not here to jump for you and like you to jump in asking how high can I jump for you or you can jump really high. Okay, is it high enough? Can I jump for you high enough or you can jump even higher? Oh how much higher can I jump?	
1	No, I am not anyone's puppet. Does it look like I have strings attached to my arm.	
3	And my legs and my feet, I don't think so.	
1	I'm a free bird and being that I'm a free bird.	
3	I can answer to the word went that I heard when I choose to join us and I can answer to the word that I heard when I choose to and when someone talks out of character when someone is coming from a place where they're spouting out all kinds of disgraceful things uncouth things things that are not pleasant. To the soul to the light to the energy to the frequency of love those things that are just, you know, just a bunch of wacky doodle nonsense just flying around ricocheting and knocking things down like a big corruptness is what I call it a big corruptness like my word, you know, you corrupt us your corrupt.	
1	This is what you are people say, what is a corrupt as your corrupt this that's what you're doing right now, you're corrupting the energy in our space with this nonsense coming out of your mouth. You think we're all going to sit here and listen to you speak. Out a bunch of nonsense coming out of your mouth when you're so intelligent and smart. You can think in a different way use your words use your words, right?	
3	And as we got to say use your words use your words word that up use your words. How do we bless those words? Let's bless up those words use your words word it up because I'm not going to sit here and listen to every horrible thing. You want to tell me about this person or this or that are these things they have no bearing on on the way in which I love and how I create prosperity and how I be able to bring healing into the minds and the hearts of people and how can show people how to be their own leader and how to lead others into Legacy and how to leave a legacy on Earth. Do you think I have time to be filling up my modus operandi my brain space my data space with this nonsense. Are you kidding me? You better check it. Because you're about to wreck it because I don't go into that. I'm very Disney. Okay, people have to understand so you may hear me curse and things like that. But I use the curse words as empowerment tools. I'm not cursing to put you down. I'm not gonna put you down very Disney. Okay, when you're around me think you're in a Disney cartoon, I start lifting you up and dancing with you and skipping down the street and showing you the way to live life happy. Okay, I'm Disney. I like to go Disney on people. I'm not sitting here listening. Listening to this nonsense coming people in mouth. Yes, if you're sick, honey. You're sick. You got the flu. Look at you go Caillou talking you're talking like are you talking you? Every time you open your mouth to sing a cursed every time you say something you're speaking against yourself you speaking against your children speaking against your husband. I got friends who like speaking to be against his boyfriend this man speaking against his wife. Just been speaking about his girlfriend his girlfriend speaking about her man. Everybody speaking about co-workers person speaking about this person. This was just speaking about that person and nothing is coming. I mean out of their mouth that are intelligent language. intelligent language means intelligence speak speak speak love intelligence. Speak is speak speak love speaks be glove. That's intelligent. Speak intelligent. Speak lifts you shifts. You ignites you invites you it welcomes you it takes you higher it sets you on fire. It's not makes you feel like you got weights and caring you down into the ground. So you can get pulled down into the hell regions into the underworld where the spirits are constantly rewinding that rhetoric of nonsense and you wonder why Here negative voices in your head because there's start that telling you and you're listening to them instead of taking them to the light that constant rhetoric of nonsense on a loop. Telling you you're fat. You're fat. You're fat. You're fat know. If you keeps if you keep listening to that, you know you I'm sorry, excuse me, except I mean, hold on a minute. Excuse me. What did you say you are fat people don't like you or we and who are you to say such a thing to the child of God to a creative illuminated being a Quantum creator of here s another Then power are you a spirit? They are you at entity. Are you a being from the underworld that thinks that you're going to speak up in my head that kind of nonsense really?	
1	Well, you definitely did come to the right place because I'm going to send you to the light so you can go home and be with your family and be back in your original form where you came from, which is light before you took an embodiment and couldn't forgive yourself after you died and you end up going in the Underworld and you think you're going to tap into my mental out.	
3	The rhythms and you're going to speak up in my head you got to have negative speak in my head you gonna tell me I'm fat when I know I'm beautiful you're gonna tell me I'm fat when I know I'm constantly losing weight and then my body's getting bigger and thinner and feeling better and good and when I'm working out I'm getting the highest level work on everything I'm doing is just being the best for my being and you're going to sit here and think I'm going to speak against myself or do you have some do you do you do you have that much belief in your power to override the Child of Light? See, that's how you have to talk. When someone calls you stupid be like, I'm sorry. What did you say? What did you say you have a flu you need you because they only care for your flu is love baby. Okay, so I'm gonna give you some love right now because I know the words that are coming out your mouth is because of your sickness. It's your flu I once was working with this woman in turkey and she called me all kinds of names in the book all kinds of names and she was sick. I said, you're sick. I thought the pears are like, I'm so sorry for I'm so sorry for her saying all these things to you. I said, oh no, don't worry about that. Don't worry about that. She's sick. She's sick. She's The flu she got the flu. She got the plague. She got something going on. We got a heel that stuff first. That's the first thing we got to heal. We got to bring spiritual awareness mental awareness of Love unconditional lovable Consciousness. We got to take it up. We gotta go higher we gotta we gotta burn the roof down on this we gotta burn it down Burnin It Down Burnin It Down burnin it down. We gotta burn it down. We gotta Burn It Down down Burnin It Down Burnin It Down burnin it down if we're going to make some changes here because all that nonsense all those languages all those words all those things that you hear all those things that are going on inside of that person's head is a virus. It's a bacteria. It's a parasite and it is wanting to get to you from another person. You think darkness just works its way through individuals Darkness has its minions to okay? When someone is operating and bobblehead Consciousness where they just accept everything, they're told without thinking and opposition to some of the nonsense that they're hearing in the world things where they think that God doesn't love them. Unless they do this this this this this this this and then finally they're going to get into the gate to heaven, please you ain't getting to Heaven if you can't be truthful and it's not because God's going to block the doors either it's because you're going to block the door because you're going to see how much of your life you wasted away. I'll nonsense and you're going to say oh no. Oh, no, I can't let go. I can't lie. Go and that's when you're gonna go in the Underworld and then people who are in the lady committee have to come and get you out of there and bring you back to the light because you didn't recognize yourself as the powerful being that you are and you turned your back on the light because you were too busy trying to be righteous. You're too busy trying to be Pious. You're too busy trying to be I have it all figured out been tality. You ain't got nothing figured out only thing you can ever figure out which will always be the only thing you really need to ever figure out is that you are being of love you come from a powerful source, which is pure Of orgasmic love when I say orgasmic. I mean it is orgasmic.	
1	That's how Universe isn't galaxies get developed in every per second millisecond that goes by if you're thinking more Galaxies have just been formed because of that orgasmic love energy and it's also unconditional love energy.	
3	It's not love energy based in the consciousness of if you do this, if you don't saying if you don't do this you don't do this and these things are going to happen, please and you wonder why there's so many sick people out there saying all kinds of of doing all kinds of abuse of things to other people abuse. Did it just start in that person abuse was bred into that person by another person and that other person was bred into them by another person and the other person it was bred into them babies from another person. That's abuse abuse is a sickness that gets transferred. It is a virus. It is a virus. My love's a sickness a virus that gets spread through words through actions through certain types of things. That they do as a human being it gets spread through the abuse and the moment that person receives it and accepts it as a being. Okay, it's not okay and don't pretend that you forgave anybody to because that's the most annoying thing ever when I had people go I forgave my father know you didn't you can't because if you try to forgive your father the moment you try to forgive your mother the moment you try to forgive that husband or your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend, whoever it is that you're with Is the moment you go into quantum entanglement. It's the moment.	
1	Someone has to be right and someone has to be wrong and that creates Duality and that creates a quantum entanglement and you are stuck and tangled up together in purgatory.	
3	The only way you can truly forgive a human being is to acceptance.	
1	Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it real acceptance everyone.	
3	Let's say it together acceptance acceptance acceptance. Let's say it again acceptance acceptance acceptance if you cannot accept They did horrible things to you and you're not an acceptance of that. You are not going to be able to let go of it. That's it. That's it. Because remember all suffering is cycled psychology its cycled psychology playing over in Loops because you have not come to acceptance you try to forgive your in purgatory quantum entanglement your entangled to that person as long as you stay in that act of forgiveness because forgiveness is I was there to trap you it is what I call forgiveness. Yes, I call a shackles. I call it being Shackled to another person.	
1	I don't want to be Shackled to my dad. I love my father and why I know people say to me but you talk about your father alive. Yes, I do because I like to be transparent in the way that I teach you and share with you knowledge and wisdom.	
3	So you don't think I'm just the sittings person sitting on a cloud and everything was so peachy King so everything so happy and so go lucky and everything was fine and nothing nothing, you know, the shaman shit don't stink. Mmm. No, I'm sorry. Yes, it does. It does.	
1	All the time because I eat very healthy. But what I'm saying is in the metaphor of it the metaphor of the idea that I have gone through things to not because I'm a victim not because I need your sympathy not because I'm like, oh my God, so I mean I'm so happy sad that went through to you.	
3	Don't be sad for anything that I want through. You should be Rejoice full that I was beaten as a child. You should be Rejoice full that I was molested. You should be Rejoice, 'full that I was an alcoholic you should be rejoiceful that I did drugs. You should be rejoiceful that I went to jail for a year. You should be Rejoice 'full for me dying and all the things that I've gone through in my life and all my health struggles that I've gone through you should be rejoiceful.	
1	You know, why you should be rejoiceful tribe. Let me tell you why because if you weren't rejoiceful for those things, then you're not rejoice for for the love that I give you a shaman Derek. Let's get it real 1000% on fire.	
3	You cannot sit back and judge those things as wrong. What you have to do is accept them. I see.	
1	So in this life my training was to have a parent like you who caused you all this pain and suffering.	
3	I don't forgive you but I accept you you bet I do I accept you and that's how me and my dad can have a great relationship. That's how come he and my mom can have a great relationship. That's me and friends who have you know, tried to take me to court and sue me things and do all these things to me and try to to do things to hurt me and take me down and all this kind of stuff and try to embarrass me in public. That's why I can embrace them. Because it was through their behavior of their illness and their sickness taught me how to become immune to their sickness and also use that as a plateau to understand deeper and more deeper and more depth and more deep in the crevice of what it means to love unconditionally. It means I can love beyond your darkness that that's what my dad and my stepmom and my	
1	Family from Hawaii taught me that's what they taught me is.	
3	Oh, I can love be on your craziness. I can love be on your Darkness. I can love be on your illness your sickness that you got to deal with and if you need my support, I can support you by giving you tools, but you're the one who's going to have to really seek that to be found in you because you have to make those shifts in those and those changes in yourself for you to be able to see. Redemption in yourself you see in my days and the things that I want do I've heard a lot of people I had to find redemption in myself so that I'm able to show up for those people that I hurt and be corrected which means be refined into something that's different from what they knew. Do you understand? That's true. That's true Evolution. Their right to evolution is not trying to sit back and act like nothing you did nothing wrong. You know, I see a lot People don't ever acknowledge when they did something on my daddy's always said to me you always acknowledge when you do something wrong.	
1	So I said, of course I do how else am I am going to redeem myself to understand myself to gather myself so that I can love myself even more. I'm not going to rely upon you to do it.	
3	Because what you say has nothing to do with me what you say has only to do with you Dad he goes. Oh, you're such a smart one.	
1	You just like your grandmother. No wonder why she chose you to be the shaman, of course, of course.	
3	Well, you know you were her Apprentice you could have been the shaman but you chose to run away from it.	
1	That's your choice. And I love you regardless the thing what we have to understand is I accept it and that I accept that he ran away. I accept that. He didn't step into that path. Like I did he didn't get in there.	
3	He didn't get in that and that mud in that trench with Grandma. And really get to learn the ways of our family and our lineage he could have he got bits and pieces of it, but he got afraid of his own power. How many people right now are in this tribe right now who are afraid of their power because someone told you that if you do something that what you want to do it so not okay for you to do because of the fact that they don't do it. Who are they? Who are they I'm sorry. Who are they? Are they going to be with you when you leave this planet? No, they're not.	
1	They're not going to be with you.	
3	When you leave this planet when you have to face your inner child, which is your soul, which is God and explain to God why you didn't live your life to the fullest because you put labels restrictions, you lied to yourself you did what other people wanted you to do and you lived under not being nice instead of being truthful. So you were eating a lot of apple pie. You just put that apple pie laughing your face you would like I love myself an apple pie. But you weren't willing to be truthful to get the kingdom. And it's not like God's gonna sit there and punish you because God don't even know what punishment is. That's a human trait. All you're gonna do is guys and say well, okay, then let go of it and the urine be like, well, I can't let go that's where you that's why we have beings in the Underworld you see because they couldn't let go so they go there to process their stuff and he meanwhile, they tap into the algorithms of your mind and start processing their information to your brain. And you start thinking it's you first time the next time you ever hear something negative in your head. I want you to do this next time. Here's something negative. What what are you serious? Did you actually think that was going to be okay? You need me to take you to the light. I'm going to take you to the light because I'm a king. I'm a queen. I'm a queen. I'm a king. I'm a king. I'm a queen. I'm a king. I'm a queen. I'm a queen.	
1	I'm a king. I'm a queen. I'm a king. I'm a king.	
3	I'm a queen I come from Majesty I come from Majesty. I'm the light on the light. I don't fight. I'm the light on the light. I don't fight. I'm a light. I'm a light. I don't fight on the light because the light just shines the light makes everything bright and that turns day from night and that's how we Lift ourselves to a higher site. You understand a higher site means what it means higher Paradigm higher Consciousness highest evolution, you know outside of box mentality and into the greater understanding of universal dimensional Quantum availability. That's how we get lit. That's how we stay lit and that's how we keep the fire burning so we can burn down the house because we gotta burn the Down the house has to come down because the house was built in correctly.	
1	We got to rebuild our foundation and the way you start building. Your foundation is start simple be like, I love how beautiful I am. I love how when I walk into a room the room lights up people love the energy that I bring.	
3	I love how generous I am. I love how when I'm standing next to someone.	
1	I have powerful healing energies penetrating in their cells and their organs and their Consciousness and their emotions and just lifting and shifting them.	
3	I love Creative I am I love how sensual I am that I can taste food to the highest level of pleasure. I can hug someone to the highest level of pleasure. I can sing. I can dance I can create I can play musical instruments. I can connect with nature and animals to the highest pleasure because I am a sensual being I'm prosperous. I'm a Floodgate Of abundant prosperous energy of currency that flows to me easily and effortlessly that doesn't take take any energies from me because my energy is constant and fulfilling. I am constantly Reviving and lifting and shifting my possibilities into higher realities that are joyful and filled with bliss and ecstasy and pleasure on all levels of my being physically emotionally mentally and spiritually, what word Up. That is how you stay lit as you start there by saying the truth and when someone says something to you that's abusive. You say I don't have time for that. You know, I don't have you ever heard that song so funny song goes. I don't got no time for that. I don't got no time for that. I don't got no time for that. That's going to be your you got to make that like your lyrical lyrics right? And when I say lyrical legs, that means that every time you're dealing with nonsense, you just got to play that in your head right just him here. Me saying that in your head. Someone says to you like you're such an idiot like I don't got no time for that. I don't got no time for that. I don't have the time for that. And if someone says like oh, you know, there's this problem going to happen if you go into business like that, but like I don't got no time for that. I don't got no time for that. I don't got no time for that. Why because you don't got no time for nonsense, right? Someone says to me. Oh Simon Derek and this person was talking about I said I've got time for that. I don't have time for that. I don't have time for that because I felt was talking about me. I don't have time for that. Why am I gonna listen to you? Tell me that I don't got no time for that. I got things to do. Right? I got I got I got bleeders to build to build Legacy. What are you talking about? I don't got no time for that. Oh such and such and this person and this person. I don't have time for that. I don't got time for that. I don't got time for that. See that's what I see.	
1	I'm programming that income program that and you right now right you're going to hear that high-pitched voice come in your head every time you Every time you getting some kind of nonsense, someone says to you.	
3	Oh you're this and you're that you go see a shaman and you take these workshops. They're like, I don't have time for that. I'm going to Top Again. I don't have a type of that. You don't even have to respond just smile at them. That's it. They're sick. They need medicine and that's love unconditional love and you can even say to them, you know, the things that you're saying aren't showing up from love aren't coming from Love Don't resonate with love and aren't love. However, I am love so I'm going to impart some wisdom on to you. You know, you believe what you want to believe that's what you choose to believe. That's okay. Okay, but I know who I am, and I don't Anything I don't need to prove anything to you. I'm not thing to prove to you, but I will say this I won't tolerate abuse and if you're going to say something to me again, it better come from a place of love because if it comes from abuse again, we're done. I don't care if we got kids. I don't care how we going to slice it and dice it.	
1	There's no room for abuse in my life and you're going to end up being alone if that's what you want because you want to push people away.	
3	So you can prove a point that you're not lovable. Then you need to go get some help, but I'm not I don't have time for that. I don't got time for that. I don't got no time for that. I don't got time for that. That's the only way because look here's the reality of it. All right, you really don't have time for it. You really don't every time if you just put it this way. Let's say for instance everything in your life was based on money. Okay. I'm going to put it to you like this. Everything in life is based on money. So if everything based on money, okay, every time you spend a minute you're either if it's going in the direction of supporting your life in the highest way you get paid, but if it's not going in the direction that supporting your highest Lake Leo highest light in your highest life in your best life, then you lose money. So someone comes and tells you oh, yeah, so, you know this person was talking bad about you and the moment you decide to listen all of a sudden your bank account starts going down. Okay, trust me. You are going to stop listening to gossip. You are going to stop listening to nonsense. You going to stop listening to keep I'm you got to be like top of that. I don't have time for that. I don't got time for that. You're going to immediately stop but hold on. That and you're going to shift gears back into focusing directing and surging your power your energy your litmus into the thing that you want to amplify the multiply and the thing that you want to fly you understand amplify multiply fly.	
1	That's what you're going to do.	
3	You're not going to be sitting back watching your bank account dwindle because you're putting your energy into something that you shouldn't have no time for so when you're dealing with sick people you gotta understand their When you deal with sick people you don't yell at them when you do a sick people you don't get mad at them. You can just dealing with sick people you stay in a place a common love, you know, they're sick. They're going through enough already a lot of turmoil inside a lot of turmoil. You just come from love. I know those things that you're saying are not who you are, but I have to let you know something and I really want you to understand and listen to me clearly. I am willing to love you unconditionally as I do right now that will always be there but I love myself more. Do you understand what that means? That means I love myself more than I love you.	
1	So let me get clear with you on that what that looks like that means I will not tolerate abuse. I will not tolerate abuse. I will not tolerate.	
3	I won't tolerate I won't tolerate abuse so That's it. So if you don't understand that I'm going to lay it out for you right now so we can end this conversation and we won't have to go through this anymore. If you make one more abusive comments to me you are going to spend your time being alone. I will still love you unconditionally, but I'm going to I'm going to love you from a distance and our way from you because you have an illness and you need to go work on that illness and I don't have time to be nurse Nancy and figure that out for you or nurse Paul are. Nurse Donovan on Earth to me qva are nourished Rashad on Earth o Muhammad or Mom at all. Never sorry. Nothing. Sorry. I have no nurse time for you. Okay, I don't have time for that. I don't have the time for that. I don't got time for that and that's it. That's how you do it and that those words of I don't got the time for that sink right into your subconscious mind. So every time you hear that high-pitched out the shaman Derek made. I don't got time for that because you have no time to be letting your spiritual bank account go down because you keep getting caught up with people who are caught up in sickness and illnesses and you can't see they have a virus and you're trying to argue with someone who's sick. I mean, do you think it's okay to go to the hospital? So yelling at people who are sick? No you let them be you give them your love. I love you, but you have an illness right now. And if you want my help, I'm here to support you. I can give you some ideas.

Come to the park or meditate with me at the beach go do something. Okay, it doesn't have to be any of those things. It could be a bunch of things. I'm just giving you some hints. But if you can't correct this this sickness and I giving you what I can give you I can only give you Band-Aids that I can give you the medicine of love.	
1	But if you cannot correct this sickness, I can't be up in it and that's it. And I said but don't pretend that you're forgiven people you accept them, but you don't have to forgive them because forgiveness puts you in purgatory and you don't need to be in purgatory because you don't got time for that.	
3	Okay, you're no time for Purgatory.	
1	So we have to honor ourselves. We have to love ourselves more than we love our we have to love ourselves more than we love our husbands our wives our boyfriends or girlfriends. We have to love ourselves more. Are we are not going to make things correct for us, which Not allow them to have correctness within them. Okay, you got to love yourself more you can love them. But you got to love yourself more and that's what it comes down to right no disrespect get it. Correct. Right? No abuse no more. That's it. And I love you so much. And that's that's what I wanted to share with you. Is my love for you because every like I go talking about my friend Mike Mike didn't just end up in that place on his own. He had ended up on that place because he had parents that spoke down to him. He had friends that spoke down to him. He had voices the spoke down to him and eventually it took him deeper and deeper and deeper into his Spirit was in the Underworld and all he could do is act out of character against himself. Which led him to incarceration? There are many people who are lost souls in this world many people. But they didn't get there because they're horrible people because they were born that way.	
3	It was in bred into them.	
1	Because someone didn't tell them the right words the truth, perhaps they didn't tell them self the truth. Perhaps they thought well, I'm not that until people acknowledge me unless I do something really great in life. I can tell myself. I'm a great person or I'm smart or intelligent or I'm creative I can make tons of money or I can be very successful. No. You don't need to wait on anyone not anymore. I give you full permission to shine radiate and illuminate this planet and burn the lights like a lighthouse that blazes in the night.

3	To survive on this planet in harmony with nature and build a different type of system that supports everyone so that we will be able to connect with our Intergalactic brothers and sisters and they won't not be like Oh, I'm not gonna land over there because you know how those humans are soon as we give them this new technology that will clean all their water and gave will give them long lasting life and all of these amazing things that they will be able to do and create new vegetation where places couldn't be created and you know, and they're sicknesses where they won't have cancer. Or any kind of crazy viruses anymore that would take their bodies out. They're gonna shoot us down and go to war with us and then sell it off and the black market and they're gonna kill each other.
