1	Oh, that's right guys. Today's episode is going to be on Jaws one of the most popular Monster movies of all time. We playing some soundtrack for the movie as well. So get ready. The information is from the Jaws vici. Here we go. The one and only original Jaws gross more than a half a billion dollars at the box office and it was the number one movie of all time until Star Wars came out two years later. George was a mixture of Terror and humor that just ignited the 1975 public that summer Steven Spielberg had caused his many people to stay out of the water as offer Hitchcock did with his shower scene from the film psycho.	
2	And today the film still stands as one of the best of its kind the movie success is someone who surprised as the shark is insane except for bits and pieces and shadows under water for an hour and 20 minutes.	
1	And as a result of that. The first time I learned is out of the water grown men peed their pants scream, like little girls and those with the faint of heart grab their nitroglycerin pills and the shark which was designed by joelle's and cost almost a quarter million dollars can be seen as part of universal.	
2	I was movie to her. So you and I are going to go behind the scenes and learn more about the fin-tastic stars of the Jaws franchise all five sharks. So let's get to it shall we the first particular particular incarnation of the shark was depicted in the film Jaws released in 1975. And in addition to that there were slightly similar looking sharks depicted on the sequel's Jaws Jaws 2 3 & 4. However, the shark design is depicted in the first film is by far. The most rare is by far the most perspective very end of all of them and the shark was originally called Bruce and it was named after it was named after Steven Spielberg's lawyer Bruce Raymer. And a and it was its knowledgeable thin fans tend to use that name as an official moniker. And a Halo static copy of groups from the film was discovered in a junkyard years later and and is an essence of fourth Bruce were pulled from old from the mechanical shark used in the production of the film and serious fans of Jaws have named this rare find junkyard Bruce or jyb Bruce was around 25 feet long and weighed around three tons. It's like when said 25 3 tons of them. And he could easily bite through a leader on a fishing line that was made of steel piano wire and he smashed the Hall of the Orca boat with his great strength Bruce's Behavior was quite unique because while normal great whites hunt prey such as seals fish and tuna Bruce preferred the taste of human flesh. He was a he was a known Maneater there were no specific patterns to Bruce's attacks, and he did not hesitate to attack swimmers by night or day. And the movie Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfuss believe that Bruce was also clever enough to lowered his pursuers into the open ocean where he had the advantage of speed and strength. he also knew that that it couldn't that it could incapacitate the Orca by disabling the hall and due to limitations in design production at the time the film making the great white shark in Jaws is depicted as an attack posture who are all I go along with it with its mouth open and pulled back and then mouth is not presented in its cruising where the nose of the shark is no longer pulled back when the shark is cruising and is longer and streamlined and this was not intentional in the design as clips of actual great whites were using the The super in the cage and as a substitute for that there was a guy named Frank Sparks. He was a substitute for it was the stand-in for Richard Dreyfuss. So when you first see Richard Dreyfuss scream, that's not Richards face, and those aren't Richards eyes. That's Frank's parks. And and because Bruce was 25 feet long a dwarf diver. What way it was used to create to was used to create the correct scale and there was one guy came in with a big strong shark and there was a cage was hanging on the wireless hatch to a winch and the shark some No guards. No was caught in the bridal try to swim forward and they got stuck and whenever great white shark its traffic was nuts. And for the and for the live-action scenes involving great whites footage of a real Bray Wyatt was circling the cage and a major stuntman plate. Matt Hooper was filmed as Bruce's 25 feet. A dwarf driver was used to help each other to create the right scale. And Bruce because Bruce Bruce became such a pop public icon that his name was used several other times in other films including as a moniker for an animatronic bull shark in the Discovery Channel show called called anatomy of a shark bite and and it's also the name of a great white that was spotted off of Guadalupe Island and also the name of a great white that it appeared in the film Finding Nemo.	
1	Remember that scene in Finding Nemo where we're Bruce cried saying, he never knew his father. This is 2 this is who you his father might have been just and in reality many of the features that Bruce accomplished at the films were like impossible for real great whites to do and although great white shark definitely damaged boat. You can't sink it in one strike and the shark is by know me and real great. Whites are also used. I mean real great whites. Also also can't pull three barrels under the water like Bruce did and Quinn said it himself and Hooper said, he's starting to wonder Quinn said he can't with three barrels on him. Not with three he can't that's amazing. And Bruce has size is and and Bruce's size is exceedingly large for a great white. But some sharks have have approached him in size such as such as the legendary female great white known as submarine and she's a supposed to 23 footer that lives in false Bay South Africa during the 1980s. And another individual known as deep blue.	
2	She's a large female that was seen enough Guadalupe Island in Mexico and Mexico in 2013, and she measures about 20 feet long and this shark was likely a similar way to Bruce due to her pregnancy at the time. She was being filmed and a third female which is known as The Hunchback was a 21-footer who regularly visited the Farallon Islands which by 50 miles off the coast of San Francisco and only female great.	
1	Whites are no intermediate to reach a length of over 20 feet.	
2	And it may and males only go up to 16 or 18 feet. So this makes Bruce who's a male like passive even for one of his kind and Bruce's great size may also be due to his longevity as as real great.	
1	Whites are capable of living of living up to 72 years and it is likely that the Bruce may be of advantage today Advanced age, which also explains his size. Excuse me. And in the movie Bruce's attack on Alex kentner. He's a little boy was originally intended to be a lot more brutal. Excuse me, and it was a shame. It was meant to show the shark's head actually rising up jump on him. And Anna and that was filmed but if they were but they couldn't show it was too violent and the scene where that guy in the Estuary got pulled under there was a scene there was a deleted scene where it shows the shark dragging him along the surface of the water and he with the young boy and how that scene worked was was he was in this little bucket seats trapped into it and the shark fin was behind him on a sled. He had the kid in his arms, and he was going to take him under water, but then he let him go and then the sled underwater and and and now we are going to discuss Bruce set that that's the female from Jaws to and the novelization of Jaws 2 which is written by Hank Searles. It is revealed early in the book that rousset was in fact Bruce's mate. The members was a shark that originally terrorized Amity Island.	
2	We're turning to the same Waters Bruce Bruce that manages to give birth to one shark pup of either before or during the time. She was being electrocuted. That and years later during the events of the novelization for jostle Revenge, which is also written by about bye-bye sterols. Okay, Bruce has ever set sole surviving pup of return would return as an adult, but I'll get to that in a moment. And now we are going to discuss the sharks that appears in Jaws 3-D. There's one called Danny and and he was that he was a nickname for the baby shark and and Michael Brownie and Michael Brody and K encounter him during their search for Shelby Overman in the lagoon where he attacked them.	
1	Although they fortunately escaped with the help of the parks resident Dolphins. They informed SeaWorld's park manager Calvin Bouchard of the Sharks presence, but he doesn't believe them and although the news all over the news is exciting to all those news is exciting to the underwater filmmaker Philip fitzroyce who stated his intention to kill the shark on network TV K was able to Kate was able to convince him that capturing and keeping the shark in captivity. When make people roll in a lot more. And after getting permission from Bouchard Daniel, Danny was captured and placed in SeaWorld's nursing tank in order to nurse him back to health and Calvin desperate to start the money rolling in and rolling it immediately prematurely orders. It moves to a small tank for exhibited with appliqu√©s permission. So he did it behind her back and K and Michael rushed they they rushed to help Danny as a crowds watch and while they were watching the shark started to the shark started to behave rather strangely kind of tilting upwards. It on its side and what and what they try to do was they tried to rescue him. They they tried to they tried to put a hose in his mouth. So water can flow over his gills to get him irrigators. We can breathe but sadly he succumbed to the stress of exposure and he passed away. But then Danny's mommy bruschetta whoo-hoo roughly measures 35 feet making her the biggest Jaws shark in the entire franchise revealed herself and began to exact her Revenge by attacking SeaWorld's underwater tunnel and causing causing water to leak into the tunnel trapping everyone and she was held captive at SeaWorld and after and after she kills diver and and after she kills divers Shelby Shelby Overman and to Cole thieves in Cold Blood as well as terrorizing other part visitors.	
2	Mike is able to use a metal. It's time to put for the pin out of the hand grenade blowing through shatters apart. Bruce has had a part in killing her and her Jaws are then shown flowing towards screen. And now the final straw people discuss is Vengeance. The one one from Jaws the Revenge this particular shark returns to wreak havoc on the Brody family. And and for some reason he apparently follows them all the way to the Bahamas to avenge Bruce and Bruce set.	
1	So so Vengeance was actually it was actually he was their son the the sum of the first and second shark. Because they were husband and wife apparently and but how Mike kills him is that he as a blast the shark would wear it with electrical impulses and that begins to drive him mad and repeatedly jumps out of the water roaring in pain and then Ellen Brody turns the boat. So I didn't show the front of it stabs the shark causing him to there's two versions of that scene. There's one where he where he explodes and and the other one is where just impales him and he just sinks to the Bottom of the Sea along.	
2	rest of the boat	
1	And now we will discuss the merchandise that jaws has that jaws has made maybe consistence Jaws are so popular there have been many there have been many games and toys there have been many many games and toys that are based on him and I will discuss them right away. So I'm just laying out the soundtrack for the movie. So there is something called the Bruce Lee Bruce the shark maquette and and that is and that is by far the most recognized model for for the shark in Jaws and he's got like a little standee stands on and and it shows him with his mouth open and and you can't take them off the stand play with him in the water if you want to do that. There's one where he is, there's one where I'm actually looking at these pictures as I'm talking. There's one where it shows him with with with the three barrels on his back. He's trying to pull them there was one there's one where it shows him actually on the platform. He was attached to during the scene and during the movie. So that's what made him move and the a mechanical shark fin. Most of the film broken down. It was unavailable for certain scenes. So therefore so therefore Steven Spielberg decided to use the camera as the shark and film from the Sharks perspective, which actually made it scarier. But yeah, because the shark wasn't working. That's what they would say. There's the shark is not working repeat. The shark is not working and and and I don't have any of these Jaws toys, but I really wish I did and I'm just looking them up as I'm talking there's one of the shark where there's there's a shark statue of him.	
2	There's that there's a Jaws maquette shot.	
1	It's by the brand Sideshow Collectibles. So If you guys want you guys want it and now you probably know what comes from and there's also one is also one complete set where it where it shows him attacking him attacking the boat. It doesn't come in like shirts are pieces altogether the except the only action figure comes with as Quint and Quint goes in the shark's mouth. And also if you look hard enough when Quint is being eaten, you can notice that you can notice a look close enough when Quince being eaten. You can notice the Sharks rubber teeth bending at his waist and any original squint was Quint dies by Drowning the road from the Harpoon that he fires up the shark wraps around his foot and he gets pulled under and he shuts for Brody to hand him a knife but it is decided that that Quinn should be eaten. So the script was changed to what's in the film. And when people first saw this movie, they were so scared that they won't even turn on the bath water and and also and the scene where Hooper Quinton Brody are out on the boat in the dark looking for the shark. You can see a meteorite shoot past Roy scheider's right shoulder. That was a real one. The second one you see was actually just added. And there's also a game called Jaws Unleashed where you are where you play as a great white shark and you get to terrorize a video and it takes place 35 years after the events of Jaws, I think. Well, I want for the we call Jaws ultimate Predator does. Oh, I also forgot I also forgot to mention that that there's noticeable jowls on Bruce the mechanical shark depicted in the film. This is clearly a mistake as well as real great whites don't have this picture. And and and a lot of people tend to go to college called the shark in the film Jaws, but they were separate sharks just like I said before.	
2	And I'm going to conclude this episode here.
