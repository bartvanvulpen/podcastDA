1	Welcome back to the thoughts by everybody is your to host up in the building. I ran the introvert and big booty Kevin here for another round another episode of the current season and today's topic is going to be all about masculinity all the toxic traits of it. Basically everything that needs to be changed and the constructs within this patriarchy and we think about it exactly all the shit that is not good and all the shit that needs to be changed. So sit back relax. Today's topic will blow you away. All right, so masculinity.	
2	I definitely feel like you would have more to say hmm. Not just being a guy yourself but being a gay man. Yes, and also being a first-generation Asian-American Damien.	
1	Yes. Yes, absolutely. So before we delve into that when you think of the word masculinity what comes into your head?	
2	Well, I feel like people typically think guys with masculinity have to be the providers. Hmm. They have to have certain criteria that they have to take off their list like the job the career certain accomplishments in life the money and yeah, so the money and then also the physical attributes of what a typical masculine man. Have and if they don't have those criterias, I feel like they're seen as you know less than or not as masculine.	
1	Exactly.	
2	And also I feel like it's masculine traits are seen to not be expressive of emotions kind of like the repression of emotions, you know what I'm saying? Because it's seen as feminine or week to express yourself. Absolutely.	
1	Yeah, so I'm glad you mentioned all those because we're going to be covering all those topics today. And first I want to go into a little bit of the origin of How masculinity started so I think the idea and concept of it really dates back to when we were cavemen and during the era of hunter-gatherers and men were the ones who had to leave the house and leave the common space in order to find food and venture out and provide for the families while women stayed home and where the nurturers yeah, and you know that was cool for cave managed to but you know, it's 2019 now, even though the concept of this is still pretty archaic. We're still suffering from its. As a society as a whole and its impact still affects humans today and I think one of the most toxic things about masculinity and its presence within humans is that it creates this standard of what men need to be exactly now don't get me wrong men. Of course, we'll always be well not always but men are the dominant ones in the society and they definitely have privilege compared to women. However, that doesn't mean that We don't experience problems ourselves. Yeah, you know and so like going along those lines.	
2	I do feel like when I was, you know coming into my own womanly powers and kind of being more of a feminist a part of the things that came with it is this weird hatred towards men. Mmm and over the years. I kind of learned that that's also not healthy right part of being powerful is also to see the power and others and that, you know men go through shit, too, and they	
1	Their own powers in themselves and you need to validate other people's issues and what they go through as well exactly a lot of the times people mistake feminism for man-hating which it really isn't because if you hate men and that's what you build your entire repertoire off of your not really a feminist because feminism is all about equality. It's really just people who believe in the political and economic and social equality for all Sexes Beyonce. I mean she melanda Aditi and go Cozy could not have said it better herself, you know, but it's really not about man-hating. It's about wanting equality for all and so going back to how masculinity how it deviates from that concept is just the fact that it's always it's plague men and it's made them think that they have to be the providers and places all this pressure on them to fit a certain mold and to fit a certain standard when they have to assume the role of this provider we have to think about we have to ask what does that entail? and all the responsibilities and the pressure that we place upon them to look a certain way and to have all these things and to just provide all these things, you know and some and you know, like some women even got it twisted in are always looking at their male counterparts or their male interests as their ATM machines and you know things that are supposed to provide solely for them and that they're just supposed to be this person that keeps giving to them over and over again and I don't feel like some people understand that there's a reciprocation any has to be held and understood and not only that but another one of the topics that we Branch onto is body image, you know masculinity is what humans are very visual creatures. And so when it's impossible to talk about what it means to be a man without addressing the preconceived notion of what you what a man has to look like and so of course, we all know that at the end of the day the biggest standard and the most desirable in Of a man is one that super buff super muscular and extremely strong. Right and of course that also dates back to the hunter-gatherer thing because based on your appearance whether or not you were strong dictated how well you were going to do and how well you were going to provide and I think that it's still one of the that's still a lasting tray in the last thing idea that we see within people if a man is, you know toned and muscular and super super defined has this, you know, like thick body we see them as more desirable and we see Them as more manly for example, skinny boys me love. You know what I mean our skin boseley some love it too, but I'm going along that.	
2	I do feel like a lot of that pressure is self-imposed. Oh definitely. I have to defend my sister's up in here or just feminine the feminine people. It doesn't have to be girl. You could be a feminine guy in the relationship. But I do feel like a lot of the masculine is have this self-imposed pressure they put on them. of to be the provider right just because in my experience I've dated so many guys who had this immense pressure that they put on themselves to be this provider and if they weren't where they wanted to be in their career or school or whatever they had to break it off with me because they needed to have those accomplishments lined up before they felt worthy enough to daily or they just felt like they didn't have enough time to put in a relationship because they needed to accomplish what they needed accomplish first, which is Fine, but I feel like it's also not the healthiest thing to it does have that pressure on yourself because you you are worthwhile regardless of your accomplishments in my eyes, but that's just something I've observed my but it's also something that's been taught.	
1	Yeah. So the man is well, you know like men are raised being taught that they have to be the one to supply everything and they have to be this strong Rock that's able to just support the woman or a support their counterparts in any A necessary and I think that it does bring a lot of men to say and when they're not able to provide or when they're not in a position of Financial Security. Yeah, and it does leave a bit of a stain on their psyche, you know, like if it's something that definitely bothers them but I think that the important thing to remember is that we're all human and that we're all going to have struggles and you're not going to always be okay all the time, you know, and it's okay to just it's okay to reciprocate and to bounce back off of each other.	
2	But that being said like I feel like there's so many times where I tried to tell someone, you know, it's okay. If you don't have enough money to be you know, paying for my dinner all the time, like I'm not asking for you to pay for my dinner or we don't have to go out all the time. You don't have to be paying for everything all the time. Right? I tell people that but then they have that pressure on themselves. Anyways thinking that well if we if it's more of an equal thing that I failed you as a man exactly because it's so	
1	So their head that they have to be the ones who are constantly on top of it and they have to be the ones who assumed the higher position of being the strong figure that supplies you with everything and don't get me wrong. I think it's it comes from some people genuinely want to provide because that's their way of showing you. Hey, I care about you. I really dig you and yeah, it's a love language definitely just giving some people are so giving you know what I mean, but at the same time you also have to recognize that you're worth isn't just what you can give. You know, it's not just what you can give and what you can provide it's also determined in the way that you love and the way you care for other people, but do you think men are taught that love is not important?	
2	It's just about what you can provide for someone.	
1	Oh, I definitely think that's how it can be sometimes and people have that. That's why people have that dis they have that Distortion when it comes to what love is that's why I feel like so many people just want somebody to give them things and they just want to indulge in all the material gifts that someone can provide with them or The material comfort of having a physical human who was there who can supply them with all these things? Am I making sense? Yeah.	
2	Do you think as a guy yourself you feel this pressure at all?	
1	Or I do I do so. Yeah, I do I feel it because there's just a certain. I mean, I feel like it's kind of hard when you're gay because there's so much fluidity between certain people. I mean nothing is ever super black and white and it's definitely not black and white right within the gay community. I feel like everything is based off individuals in certain situations, especially within our community.	
2	You have to say though. I hear a lot from like gay friends. I have like, oh I want to sugar daddy.	
1	Oh, yeah. Well, I mean to be honest. I feel like everybody wants a sugar daddy. I don't want to sugar daddy why I feel like if you if anybody would have the option of having somebody pay for this shit. They live in Italy with my shit.	
2	Oh, oh, all right.	
1	Oh someone something well, look. I'm just saying if you just take me out to dinner and I have to listen to all your problems and then you just want to pay my tuition or pay for my shit. And that's fine.	
2	I'm sorry. That's your Capricorn Moon time.	
1	Okay, I got no problem. Look no. It's a fair exchange though. If I'm I've lived I'm a I know it may not seem like this thought spot audience, but I'm actually a great listener and I give bomb-ass advise. You can ask my old roommate. Shout out to cab Suarez. Okay. I was helping him through his shit. Okay. I'ma give somebody. Matthew do you really do I do so, I feel like even though it's a common Trend that we would rather I think for some people they would just they want to go the easy route. And of course have his fantasy of somebody who's just going to give them everything they want and more like, you know, all jokes aside, but I think that within the gay community it's not is sometimes it's not going to be super black and white to see who's going to assume a position of power, but sometimes I don't really see it that way because I feel as though if I'm the one asking somebody out if When he's expressing interest. Okay, then I kind of be the one who has to take initiative to pay for someone's food or to you know, take them out and do all these things for them and just kind of provide and I feel like in any situation. It should always be both parties reciprocating in both parties putting in an equal and mutual amount of effort. Yeah, definitely. Do you feel as though the whole conversation about providing makes some people think that they can take a back seat and not put as much effort.	
2	Effort in I definitely feel like there's people who take advantage of that because I do hear a lot from you know, co-workers or friends that they have or want sugar daddies and yeah like that or they want to be that stay-at-home. Mom just takes care of the kids and holds the home down while the husband is out getting the money, right but I feel like since I didn't grow up in a typical home where my mom was the stay-at-home mom. I didn't grow up with those, you know social Rex because both of my parents work and my mom didn't she wasn't the type to come home and like cook dinner my mom and dad were both equally not very parental. So I feel like for me personally, I don't feel comfortable with someone providing for me. Okay.	
1	I'm very much so independent person because you've had to do it all on your own.	
2	Yeah. I feel like I would never be comfortable with living off of someone like that because I have this fear of being dependent. I don't want to be dependent I want to Have my own career. I want to have my own shit going on and I don't want people paying for me all the time. I mean, it's fine if you pay for my stuff, but I also have to give you something back right type of right? I definitely feel like there are people who take advantage of it and a lot of girls are just feminine people in general that date masculine people. They do see them as like providers, but I feel like a lot of at the same time A lot of people are growing out of that. But I don't I don't know. I do see a lot of it disappoints me. I would say when I do see you know girls or guys just taking advantage of these providers and being so fucking lazy and not having anything going through them.	
1	Like it just it even irritates me. Just when I see all this shit online about like, oh, well, what can he do for me?	
2	Of course, not everybody is like this, you know, it's like a shot me I'll send you feet pictures for $500.	
1	Okay now see, hold on. I don't think that's the issue. Hold on. Hold on wait, pause pause Irene. I will have to as your colleague and as your friend and as the homie, I will have to politely disagree on this with you one of the percent if if you can provide a service that somebody is paying for then why the hell not look if you want some feet pics. All right, then. Well, you gonna get some feed pigs. There's going to be a fee and you could pay up. I honestly think that shit is hella funny.	
2	I think I'm just put off because I knew a girl in real life that wanted to do shit.	
1	That and so she didn't actually do it. She wasn't about it.	
2	She was just all - anything because I don't know who's listening and who's not oh little bit of my personal experience with her just like I don't know it wasn't it didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.	
1	I just don't like people exploiting others and just being lazy.	
2	Yeah, like the lazy part is the biggest thing. Okay, because you feel like it's just it's one thing to have your own job and hustle and then on the side, this is your extra money. Oh, you're just sitting pretty at home. Homesteading feet pictures and getting hella money for that.	
1	It just puts me off. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what? I understand why you're saying that and I understand where that's coming from. I agree with you and I can see why you have that opinion. But I also feel as though because women are exploited and because women are the ones who are oppressed that they have every right to exploit men in any way they can and if it's just only people exploiting right? I don't you know, I don't like that either, you know at the end of the day, it's not okay, but it's You know and no one's being harmed in this process. If this is a very well-off person who clearly you well off if you paying $500 for some goddamn feet pictures. Alright, let's be clear on that. It's mostly just that situation makes me sad right I can still keep I can see why it makes you sad but at the same time like if you really are out here paying $500 for feet take Simon no judgment, but you might want to see if there are any like, I mean, I like look we all have our fetishes in our Kings. I'm not knocking on you like, you know, do what you want with those pictures, but It you paying $500 for that then that well, I mean keep doing it because the people taking the pictures need that so, you know, what do you keep giving people their coins? Okay, I support you I support both ends of the party exactly exactly. Oh, yeah. So now on to our second topic our second branch of our main topic today, and that is body image, so we touched a little bit based on that.	
2	That but a lot to say about this, I have lots of down this to you on the first I could go first Margo first baby go first. So your girl has been on. Tender for a while Yoshi. Has he been you've been real on and off, you know real on and apparently it's a thing because I asked guys on there just because I'm a very curious as person what it's like to talk to girls on Tinder and they say that it's very common for girls to put in their bios. You have to be this height. You have to look like this do these Hobbies blah blah blah blah. I was so surprised when I heard that girls will straight up be like you have to be 6 feet or above Stuff like that and that's it hisses me heard this so many times from different guys. I've been on Tinder and it makes me so sad. It's very common Apparently after you match for a girl to just right off the bat be like, how tall are you?	
1	That's so sad. Right? I've seen people do that to know people. Yeah people be having insane fucking standards on their profiles and a lot of their on Grindr. Racist but they be taught they body shaming people on there too. So while this does surprise me because this is a heterosexual World point of view. It kind of doesn't surprise me at the end of the day because I've just been saying a lot of people slandering short men or men who are just like five eight and under who might be an average high and that shit pisses me off because yeah because short men all men desire everybody deserves to be validated and seeing like Fuck Y'all. You know what? I mean? It's annoying because women are the ones who deal with all this. Shit about having to look a certain way and are the ones who go through the most pressure. Yeah to be beautiful and some meet a certain requirement. Otherwise, they're not seen as valuable, you know, as humans were all taught that were our value is based in what other people see in us, you know, we have to constantly be validated and feel good through other people and while women experience that on a whole different level than men do it's very different men still go through it too, you know. Men feel emasculated a when they're not tall be when they're not muscular or if they're bigger and more plus size and you know to just be flat out that shallow and to just dismiss somebody simply because of their height and to dismiss somebody because of their body type is just it's not you know, like fuck you don't be shallow give somebody a chance, you know what I mean? And you know, like I feel like we're all Hypocrites of this. I was having a huge we were having this huge discussion at our house remember but yeah, we this got so huge discussion. It was like all my Union City friends and we were just all getting into this huge argument because my friends were saying like they were saying like, oh, I would never like you if I don't find somebody cute I'm not going to talk to them. Like I'm not gonna talk to the ugly girl. I'm not going to talk too ugly dude, and I was like, well, excuse me. Like, why would you say like that like, come on just give somebody a chance and you know, I'm not gonna lie like my best friend Caitlyn called me out and she was like Okay Kevin, but don't lie though. You are pretty superficial sometimes and I Like oh, yeah, like no I know for a fact I am and I feel like we all are as human beings, but I just and you know, like everybody has different preferences and that's not that's I'm not saying that everybody has preferences as a way to justify you being flat out this rude and dismissive of other people, but I'm saying go about it in a gentle way and not only that but find it in you to give somebody else a chance be more open-minded. A more open-minded, you know, like I know girls I know girls who date guys who are shorter than them. Yeah, and they've had and they have great experiences.	
2	I mean, look at Joe Jonas and his girlfriend.	
1	Oh, she's taller than him.	
2	She's pretty here. I'll show you a picture like whenever they're together. It's kind of like she's the more masculine looking one.	
1	Oh, yes exalting him go him, but he looks so good. I wish that was more normalized. I wish it was more normalized say hello work it exactly they do you honestly the best I love that. Yeah, and that's the thing too. People are so afraid of what other people think that they just don't take a chance and they just don't even give it a second thought because they think oh it's going to look weird. It's going to be this is going to be that and you're not living for yourself and you just living for other people and I feel like that's why a lot of girls don't I was cute. I love that. I love that girl costume. Yeah cosplay, but I think that's what's so funny. I forgot what I was going to say, but I think that's why you just need to give other people chances. Like I'm not gonna lie. I sit here and act like I'm Mother Teresa and that I've just been this I'm this amazing super kind like person that you should look up to because I've definitely had my moments where I've been shallow. I mean, I could be superficial sometimes too. But at the end of the day I try my best and I'd say there's a voice inside me. That's always saying hey, Give somebody a chance or is like at least say hi back or you know, like politely know that you're not tell them that you're not interested if anything should happen, you know what I mean? But I think that completely like I've seen bitches like just say shit on Tinder where they just say. Oh, you're five five exactly and I saw that and this girl was just like he's a what do you mean exactly and she said what am I supposed to do pet you and I was like, oh come on now, she's basically treating him like an animal like it. Like you can't as invalidate him just because he masculine him like yeah, you can't do that. What if he's a great person and what if he has bomb-ass dig you're missing out just because some people that show doesn't mean they have a little digs now. Come on now, come on now.	
2	Okay. I was with a guy who's six seven and he had the smallest dick, you know, any of them. Oh, yeah. Let's hope he's not listening to this point.	
1	Let's hope he isn't no but yeah, no for real of a moment of silence soldiers. But um, Yeah, no, we need to we need to give our men love to you know, like you don't need to be having some washboard abs and some bulging pecs and bit fat ass biceps just to be considered beautiful.	
2	Now that you said that I've been with guys before that were so insecure about how their body look that. They had to keep their clothes on while we you know, my mom's in the other room. So I'm not going to say it out loud moments mamasan knows what's going down in the podcast. They'll just say shit like Oh, I have a dad bod right now. And I feel like that's so sad because you guys are staring that intimate moment with each other like who the fuck cares it's kind of like their insecurities rubs off on me in a sense where I'll look at them in that way that they're looking at themselves like, oh, you're right. You are kind of yeah. Yeah, you have to own up to it. We're just not care. Like if you look a little fat that day, like don't even mention it. Just do you and if I'm not paying attention then in you're not paying attention who?	
1	Who fucking cares, you know, you know, it's interesting that you say that because I think that what you just said brings us back to the topic of or brings me back to the topic of the mind and how if something matters to you, it will be obvious and that is what your focus will be fixated on but if you carry yourself with confidence, which is not the easiest thing to do in life, sometimes let's be real you are going to prevail. You're going to persevere and I'm glad you brought that up because I will be completely honest. There's been times where I haven't like take I keep certain articles of clothing on because I feel self-conscious. Really. Yes. There's been times when I've we have done that because if I don't know you that well or if I'm in a brand-new situation, I'll be self-conscious but depending on how I feel and how had I think because I don't think girls care.	
2	Hmm because I don't know something about I feel like as a A woman when I'm intimately with a guy well something the back of my mind that tells me like he honestly doesn't give a fuck what I look like but I feel like with a lot of guys I've met it's not like that for them. They're really insecure about their bodies for some reason. Hmm.	
1	Well, I think it is just because it goes back to the whole being insecure thing and just not even controls would be more insecure.	
2	Right?	
1	Well, I think that everyone's different and at the end of the day there has to be some women who've On to what have done the same things that the guys you've been with have done that wouldn't surprise me either but I think that it's just about realizing that certain things really don't matter in life and they're going to have a negative effect on you because you view them in a negative way. You know my your the way your body looks isn't going to affect your ability to fuck, you know what I mean or like get down in the bedroom, you know, and I think that it's good that we acknowledge that you know, because if you're going to be intimate with them And let's be real if y'all genitals are going to be interacting then your body the rest of your body should be too you know, so I think it's something that we have to remind ourselves that is very quite literally superficial at the end of the day and going back to the topic.	
2	Okay. Now that you said that I have a series where I shoot nude men and I have a couple of them where they're older men. Mmm, and the last older guy shot the whole time. I was shooting him. He was just Like oh, you know I'm old now, so my body is doesn't look as good as it used to and I'm just like, okay and he's like if you don't mind can you edit my stomach to be smaller in the photos? And I was okay but in my mind, I was just like dude, you're literally not to make it sound mean but you're literally 60 something years old who the fuck cares about if you have a stomach or not that says nothing about who you are as a person. Yeah, and the fact that he kept pointing it out and pointing it out. Maybe just look at him in a different. Different way yeah in a sense where if you were to just own it and just not care or bring it up. I would think he's I would see him as a human being and I appreciate him for that. But the fact that he kept, you know, putting out this insecurity and trying to validate himself and say, oh I used to look good is just now I you know, I'm older but I don't know. It's just it was really sad for me to see that.	
1	Yeah it is because everybody should be confident. I feel at the end of the day everybody deserves to love themselves and to be In content with who they are not just for who they used to be and what they look like, but the person they are now in the person that they're growing into in the person that they are becoming it also makes me wonder what he was like when he was young if he's superficial now as an older Grandpa, he probably he's probably one of those people who can't let go of the past.	
2	Yeah and can't like back in the day. I was a football player type of a guy.	
1	Yeah, exactly. I think it's important to accept the chapters of our Lives and come to terms with how chapters in our lives and and the only thing that matters is the present along and also along with superficiality.	
2	I think it's okay to care about what you look like absolutely care about your fashion how you put yourself out there. But I also feel like you need to be easier on yourself in a sense where if you're not looking too cute that day. It doesn't make you less of a person. Yeah, it doesn't say that again say that so then also there's just more to a person than their looks. Actually, I've met people on Tinder where they look good, but when it comes down to it, they can't fucking keep a conversation going and I no matter how good you look I will not want to keep on going on dates with you. I don't want to feel like I'm talking to a wall like I want to connect with someone.	
1	I want to hear what they're passionate about all that shit, you know, exactly exactly and you can only do so much with image. Yeah, you know, so I'm glad you're saying that because caring about how you look there's nothing wrong with that and I was talking about again. with one of my really close friends and she was saying that she she opened up to me about how she is so tired of constantly worrying about how she looks and how she also feels guilty for it and I agreed on her 100% because I'm in the same boat with her and we connected and bonded over the fact that we Both share the similar guilt for constantly worrying about our look and worrying about our vanity how that's always on our minds and how tiring and how exhausting it is. And you know, everything in life is okay, but there needs to be there needs to be you need to draw a line somewhere at the end of the day and everything is okay with in moderation. It's not bad to care about the way you look it's a good thing. Make sure your presentable make sure you feel confident.	
2	Look at it self-expression type exactly.	
1	Like for me fashion fashion is an extension of my identity and my personality so I sold that stuff matters a lot to me but there's certain boundaries that need to be drawn because it could cross over to being unhealthy real quick and real fast and I feel as though for people like me that is our struggle in life drawing that line and found finding that balance. Boundary and knowing when to say okay. Well, maybe I don't look that great today. Maybe I'm not that popping this day, but bitch I'm still popping at the end of the day regardless because it's not about the person that's it's not about the clothes that you wear. It's about the person wearing the clothes you feel me and it's about the person behind the muscles the person behind that body behind all that. Yeah, who are you at the end of the day? Yeah.	
2	I didn't know you cared about	
1	Superficiality that much I do I do because I was bullied a lot when I was younger for being overweight and really yeah. I was yeah, I was over there. I was a junkie kid. I know I know my limbs grew out. I'm like, I'm super lanky. I went from chunky Kev to lanky kid real quick. Yeah. So I think that also contributes to why sometimes I have body dysmorphia to do you really I don't know if I want mean yeah because I feel like it is somewhat of I'm still exploring myself. So I don't know if I want to flat out call it that yeah, but I know that vanity is something that I do struggle with to and confidence is are all things that I struggle with and I know that it's something that men struggle a lot with two and going back to that conversation. There are some men develop an unhealthy Obsession where they just even get me started. Yeah, I mean they feel as though they're not enough no matter what they do. No matter how much they work out. No matter how much they discipline themselves. They're not enough and there's a flaw and they're too small. Can I share a story about please do please do baby hit my thoughts pot hit my thoughts my baby.	
2	Okay. So my first experience with this whole body image and Men. Type of deal was with one of my last eggs that my last serious relationship horrible one, right? Yeah. He was okay. He fucked me up so bad, right but I dated him for two years right him sis drag him know I went by but I do want to share this in case other guys suffer with the or girls are dating someone or guys are dating someone that is like this but he was so obsessed with how his body looked and he had such bad body dysmorphia that he always thought he was fat and he wasn't muscular and it was to a point where he didn't know. He never wanted me to see him. Wow, because he thought he was so ugly. Wow, he would work out three hours a day and not eat anything. And yeah, and I wasn't it was so bad that I wasn't allowed to eat in front of him.	
1	Are you serious? Yeah, you couldn't eat in front of him.	
2	No because if I was eating something it would make him hungry because he's smelling the food and it would make him want to eat and once he started eating. He couldn't just eat a normal amount. He would binge eat. So he had a binge eating issue and also anorexia on top of that. There was no in-between. It was just once he ate it's like he has to just like fuck it. It's all ruined for him. He might as well eat a large pizza and a whole liter of Coke and eat just shit for the rest of the day. So intense, yeah, I remember after we broke up he even gone to steroids. I heard from Rachel friend. Oh my God. Yeah, and he was just so into how he looked he always wanted to his dream was to you know, go into a bodybuilding / aesthetic competition. That's a whole nother topic. I think that's so fucking sad.	
1	Yeah the whole car that's definitely the male the male counterpart of beauty pageants. Hmm.	
2	Oh for sure. Yeah, but that was my first time really witnessing how much pressure men go through. Yeah when it comes to obtaining that ideal. Yes that occur.	
1	Money and there are a lot of people who kind of don't realize it or invalidate the struggles that men go through and the thing is he looks so good in my eyes and everyone else thought.	
2	He looked amazing but behind closed doors and in his own mind, he was just suffering so much. He was not happy. I mean, of course, you know, I can be happy for not fucking eating anything, but he was just so obsessed with how he looked yeah and even guys I've casually dated after him they were All just obsessed with how they looked and working out which is okay because working out is good for your physical health, but once it takes over your mind where that's all you can think about and talk about feel like that's just so unhealthy. You never hear girls just constantly talking about working out and looking a certain way.	
1	I feel like the way they express their concern with vanity diverged. That's where they diverge because it's expressed through different habits and different expressions. I mean, I think yeah, typically typically that makeup is a whole nother situation. That's a whole another topic for another time. But women Express that through I guess more so through fashion and through comparison and through sometimes I feel like cattiness and pettiness where they where they antagonize one another and males do it. But I think they do it in a more low key way where if they are comparing themselves and competing against one another it's more internalized. And so yeah, that's what they just I feel like that's just how there's different definitely different forms of how they express and deal with that internalized struggle. Yeah, but it really is surprising to see how the extent to which people care about how they look and how far they're willing to go to achieve a certain look and how it's constantly on their mind constantly what they think about and I feel as though everybody in life experiences. This sort of thoughts at least once. Yeah, I mean, it's always refreshing to meet people who don't care about how they look it's so refreshing. I've met people who are just not superficial at all and they don't give a shit and they don't really care and it's not something that concerns them and that's not to say that they should be admired more or more valuable than other people who do but it's just the matter of different interests and different things that you Prioritize in life but coming from somebody who does worry about all those types of things. It's refreshing to meet somebody like that. There's been situations where I've come across people who have just been able to give me such a rejuvenating perception because it's something that's so different from the world that I'm constantly living and I definitely appreciate that because it reminds you that at the end of the day you have your head you have your brain and you have your heart and that's what's going to triumph over anything at the end of the day, you know, like don't let The way you look stop you from sure from making friends and making connections, you know, like accomplishing exactly exactly because I'm like, I'm hella skinny, like I'm lanky as fuck. Okay, like I'm lanky as fuck and I'm flabby butt and so in the summer like when we're going to and yeah, and I'm pretty insecure about it and but during the summer when we're going on camping trips when we're taking pictures when we're doing all those things. I think to myself am I really not going to have a good time and not am I going to let not having quote the perfect body deter me from having a good time. Deter me from having fun and deter me from dancing a living my best life. I'm not going to I'm never going to do that never in my life. Am I going to do that? I'm always going to have fun and try to be the best version of myself, wherever I am wherever I may be.	
2	Yeah and you attract what you put out there. So if you're just comfortable in your own skin and you are confident and you like you for who you are Zach people are not gonna people are going to Give you that same energy. They're just gonna you know, go along with your Vibes and not care about how you look but if you're just constantly, you know, looking insecure and just like hiding yourself. Then people are going to notice that and give that same Vibe back to you. Exactly it's there's nothing more beautiful than somebody who loves himself and and someone who's confident truly truly people enjoy confident people because how many times have someone pointed out something about themselves that they're so insecure about it and then you don't even notice.	
1	Is it exactly and that's such a human thing to do to like everybody is always saying or obsessing and putting down a certain quality that they have whether it's physical or mental and we all have that friend or we've always been that friend who was quite surprised at what they've said because we don't think it's an issue or we see it, but it's nowhere near as big as they make it out to be because we're Our Own Worst critics.	
2	You know, I really changed my mind. The whole body image thing boy, not only that X that I had but also as a photographer who shoots people I've taken four years of Photoshop learning how to edit people to look the way they do and I'm not going to lie. I shoot pretty good-looking models and even I have to edit them and those models are also insecure as fuck. You know what I mean? Oh, absolutely and that really showed me no matter how good you look you're still going to be insecure exactly.	
1	You know, why because cuz you have to maintain that appearance. Oh, yeah, and not only do you have to maintain it. But your tart or you see it as one of your most valuable assets and because of the fact that beauty is fleeting. It's never permanent because there's going to come a day where you outer beauty phase that's it will fade. You know, you're not always going to be that beautiful 20 something and you have to be careful because you cannot make Your beauty as your main asset.	
2	Yeah, we're all going to die one day exactly get wrinkly. We're all going to shit in our diapers and we're all gonna die.	
1	Exactly exactly. Maybe hopefully it's not that depressing feel me but it's all going to happen. All our beauty is going to fade and all our outer beauty is going to fade and not only that but it's not wise to put your worth and to place of your importance in the way. You look it's so temporary.	
2	Yeah, and you just can't trust Photos and social media nowadays. You have no idea how many hours I put into editing the photos.	
1	I be posting, you know, the people that people and the pictures that people themselves post. So first all curating is all period we've all had our catfish moments when we have a bomb-ass picture you feel me, you know, how you know what I mean times I'm out with my girlfriends and we take a picture and then spend the next two hours editing it just to post it.	
2	That stuff is so fucking you can't trust social media nowadays or how many times you	
1	We take the picture because somebody didn't like the way they look. Oh, yeah, I've been that person to well actually no, I'm that person when I went myself with some selfies bomb never be that from like, hey, that's it again. Yeah palletized. It's just relax just have them block out your face. You put a Mosey on if you don't want to be in that shit.	
2	Okay, but I feel like we're going off topic from masculine.	
1	We know we know but we I think that these are all within the Campo. Yeah for sure.	
2	I just don't want to keep going down side path.	
1	No. No totally totally.	
2	I asked a little bit of questions that people had on my Instagram and I could just address them right now and see what we have to say. So I asked a question. What's your experience with toxic masculinity and ironically no guy replied with their experience damn because I feel like men are scared to express themselves. They see it as weakness. Hmm. So I know I could literally see how many guys have seen this and only woman replied.	
1	Dude, would you say you have an equal ratio of male to female viewers? Yes and followers. Yeah.	
2	Okay, but let's see one girl said I wish men could express their emotions more without being labeled as too sensitive gay or being too feminine. What do you think about that?	
1	Oh, I have a lot of things that I think about that. I think that it's absolutely ridiculous men have been taught that once again that they need to be these big strong solid rock. That they have to be the providers and that nothing can shake them. They have to be these strong statues that are unwavering. You know, they can't let there's always this culture of oh don't let them know that it affects you which is fair and which of course I agree with at certain times, but it's not cool all the time. You know, you can only go so long pretending like something doesn't bother you until you come crashing down because it's human beings if you are not emotionally intelligent if you are not checking in with yourself, if you're not able to express your feelings, or if you're not able to release your feelings in a healthy way or process them or process them in a healthy way you you will come crashing down and you will definitely feel the effects of all that because of all that you're depriving yourself from its it's a beautiful thing to be able to feel emotion and sometimes we get a bad rep bad rep as sensitive people, especially Pisces not, you know being people who are too emotional we're seeing this week and we're seeing a sensitive but there is so much strength and vulnerability. We will tell you that right now because I would much rather and it's not even just my opinion. It's not even my opinion, but would you rather have somebody who is just this who doesn't open up to you and it's just this cold cold stuff like Stone Cold person who's just emotionless all the time and just reject any idea of emotion or would you rather have somebody that you can connect with and somebody who is Open and honest with you and telling you about an opening up to you about their fears and their loves and their interests. And what makes them light up and what makes them feel alive. There's so much power and emotion and we at the end of the day, we are human beings. We are all going through something. Everybody is fighting a battle, you know, are you you need to as a human being you need to be able to sit down with yourself and check in with yourself and ask yourself. How am I doing? What's bothering me? Why is this bothering me is everything okay, like check in with yourself, you know and ask yourself. How am I handling this? What am I going to do or how am I going to handle this?	
2	Because emotions make everyone unique and it's really do you know they call it in the spiritual World they call it the 5D and also the 3D. So 3D is what you accomplished in the Physical Realm where as 5D is what you accomplished in the spiritual mental emotional realm and if you If you think about it, the 3D realm is boring. It's like you get a job you go to college blah blah blah get your degree. You can tog refer. It's very like, you know, these specific steps. Whereas the 5D dots when people are different and how you process your emotions dictates what you do in life and who you decide to become what you decide to accomplish is all from processing your emotions and your thoughts. So I feel like if you are suppressing that side of yourself, are you truly who you're supposed to be? Or are you just following along with the guidelines of what Society is telling you to follow?	
1	Yeah. I mean, you're not living your life at all. If you are basing your life and you living your life to a set of standards and living life based off what somebody or what something is telling you to do or to be That's not healthy at all and you're not living in your truth. You're not being honest, but however, it's something that's taught to our men and talk to our boys. They're taught. That they cannot feel emotion that that they're not allowed to cry and they're not allowed to do things and more. So why is it that men aren't allowed to be unique and they're not allowed to be different anytime. We put men in such a small box. We really do we put them in such a small box of this of this Hardman as chimamanda. Adichie ngozi said we put them in this box with all these restrictions and a very very clear short description of what a man should be and anytime. Man deviates and Strays a little bit outside that box. The first thing that is called into question is their sexuality. Oh, you're gay you're gay you're gay you're gay this this is gay. That's just gay all but that's how the gay I'll fuck with that gay shit fuck out of here with that gay shit. You know what? I mean? Like, it's always that that's being called into question. It's sighs guys can't even take care of their personal hygiene without can't even give a shit about their hygiene without being called Gay that is a stylistic exactly exactly. Lee you don't want your you don't want men to be presentable you think that it's okay for men to be stuck to still be out here crusty as well because it's gay to to wash your face and not be Ashy and to moisturize come on now.	
2	Come on people want those skin flakes.	
1	They like it on. No, not me. Oh, not me. Oh, not me baby.	
2	Yeah. It's so funny. You say that because one of my best friends always gets mistaken for being gay just because he really does not care about how he presents himself. So like he wears quote feminine clothes. Yeah, like they could be pink. They could have floral stuff all over it. I don't know just the stuff. He does. He's more expressive and expresses emotions a little bit more animated. Yeah. Yeah, and he's just very open to everyone. He likes to make gay jokes a lot not making fun of gay people right you like to act like he's Gala. Right? Right. He's just more in touch with his feminine side, but I always saw that as just that's him. Right over the years.	
1	He always tells me that people think he's gay, right and it always makes me wonder why because I think that I mean as a society in general, I think that we really do shun individuality.	
2	We really do I feel like women nowadays there could be the very early feminine girl there could be that strong powerful independent girl like we have so much freedom to act and dress.	
1	However, we right right.	
2	There's some right like men are still boxed into this. Right right and they can't even Wear certain clothes without seeing being seen as more feminine or gay.	
1	Yes. Yes. Okay. I'm so glad you brought this up because I've always thought that this was such an interesting oxymoron to or such an interesting juxtaposition because of the fact that women are the ones who are clearly oppressed clearly oppressed in life. We live in this misogynistic patriarchy, okay, but it's always been so interesting to me how men are the ones who have every bit of restraints placed on them in terms of self-expression. Ian and fashion, whereas women are free with anything women are encouraged to be androgynous women are encouraged to wear everything in to experiment with all these different colors and fabrics and textures. Now, of course women still have certain standards placed upon them to be pretty and all those. Yeah all those things. But of course at the end of the day, we can all agree that women have so much more freedom when it comes to fashion and men really don't because the minute that they do something that's a little bit more extravagant a little bit more flare. Can I throw something out there automatically deemed gay what's up?	
2	So whatever just in general. I feel like women have been more oppressed over the years. Hmm. Do you feel like because of that oppression women are so unafraid to just Express themselves because of that because they're just like well, fuck it. Like we have nothing to lose. Whereas men since they have more privileged there. They have less of a drive to go outside the box because they're just you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm getting at.	
1	That's that I definitely feel like that too.	
2	I feel like because I mean, Simple thing like red carpet, you see all the fucking dresses. They're so beautiful or like a woman comes in a suit like Lady Gaga. Mmm, and then all the guys are literally wearing black tuxedos, you know, right? Why do they feel the need to do that?	
1	I feel like just because of the fact that Beauty has plays a larger role and has a bigger emphasis in women. There's a huge. How do I put this people give a shit about how men look to but they give more shits when it's women because	
2	That is supposed to be some of a woman's main concern is how she looks but then again, I feel like if these men want to go outside the box and wear something different, even if they wanted to they they would feel like they would get judged for it.	
1	So they know absolutely there's a whole bunch of people who don't do so because they don't want to be perceived as gay but at the end of the day if you are secure enough with yourself as a human being if you're secure enough in your sexuality and your masculinity, it wouldn't be a problem. There's dudes who died there are bunch of colors. Who are all these different things who do all these different things and are super unique and they're flat out straight and they do not give a shit and they joke around with their friends because they're so comfortable with who they are and they don't see who they are as an issue and they don't restrict. They don't Place recite these restrictions upon themselves, and I feel like that's how you're truly able to Enlighten yourself and live your life. Once you've freed yourself from all of that.	
2	I guess. I'm just trying to figure out why Since men are seen as more privileged and have more freedom to do what they want.	
1	Why do they technically suppress themselves more than women do because even though men are privileged that we still you have to remember that. We still hold them to a standard. We still put them in that small box. You know, we still put them in that box to be this person to be this man to fit this image and going outside of that dressing a certain way coming off a certain way discredits them. And this Associates them from that image.	
2	So for example, I'm trying to get at this concept where you and your siblings. There's always the good child and then the bad child if there's that bad child that's always getting accused of doing some shit or thinking some shit and to a certain extent that that child is going to just over the years be like, well, they're gonna judge me anyway, so I might as well just do whatever the fuck I want. Whereas the grandchild has so many things to live up to that even if they wanted to step out of the box, they don't because they have like this image to I feel like that's the concept of men just staying within their safe little box. Right? It's not that people are suppressing them. It's like a self-imposed pressure type of a thing. Well, yeah, but I feel like if men wanted to step out of the box and dress different or act different they do have the freedom to do that, but they're just suppressing themselves. Exactly.	
1	Exactly.	
2	I agree with you 100% whereas woman it's more of a suppression from an outside Source, but over a Year's like women, you know decided to just go Go against it regardless and Empower themselves. Whereas I feel like men don't have that outside suppression. It's like more of an inner suppression.	
1	Oh, yeah, like they don't that's what I'm pretty good which is what are you trying to say that they don't really have a community or other people. They can look towards to empower them when they're feeling a certain way when they're suppressing them.	
2	So it's just self-suppression to just stay in a safe realm. Mmm. Whereas in reality if they want to step outside the box people were will respect them because men are respect.	
1	Exactly. Like I don't I love when a man is confident enough to rock like not even just romantically would like thinking thinking it's attractive but I think it's dope when a guy is expressing himself in some loud clothing and he's rocking it at the end of the day. You can walk anything. Yeah be your fucking self and have the confidence to wear it because when you turn heads it's there's nothing. I mean, there's nothing like it not saying that it's everything in life. But you know, you kind of know you're doing something right you being Loud and standing out is a great thing in life. It's fun. And it's it helps you grow into yourself more it strengthens you and I believe that being loud with who you are and the way you present yourself and being different is you getting closer to yourself because one of my favorite YouTubers said that strength and confidence comes from putting yourself out there and I think there's nothing more powerful than somebody who knows that they look good. Well, who's there's nothing more powerful than somebody. Is willing to try different things and is willing to go out their comfort zones and is willing to be comfortable in themselves and learn more about themselves.	
2	I think what I'm trying to get at is I feel like so for example women are just historically more suppressed. Right? Right. So it's kind of a mentality of what do I have to lose type of a thing where men since they aren't suppress their mostly encouraged throughout Society. It kind of makes it so that they don't feel the need to step outside the box. It's more of a false impression rather than freshen from society	
1	Okay. Okay. I you know what? I did I do I do explain this I do get it but can you say just one more time?	
2	So okay.	
1	So for example because I do feel like men are suppressed like even though they're privileged.	
2	They're they're giving that makes them even more self suppressed.	
1	Yes, because while they do have the upper hand, they're given a very specific list of instructions on who they can and can't be not necessary.	
2	Okay. So what I'm trying to get at is okay say there's two people stepping up to box each other. One person has had many losses leading up to it and a few wins. Whereas another guy has them all wins and no losses. The person who loses more will go into it just being like well, what do I have to lose? I'm going to give it 100% And like go outside their box into winning the match. Whereas the other guy who wins all the time. He knows that doing certain things will get him that win and he has an experienced law. So he's like, I'll stick to this thing that I know know know possibly win. In you know, okay. Do you know that concept I'm trying to get out I get what you're trying to get at. So if things are already working out with you throughout life the what's the point of stepping out the box, you're just the typical say if you're just like a normal last guy standardized body. You're pretty good at school. You have a pretty good job. Then why do you feel the need to go outside your box and venture out into different fashion and two different Hobbies. Well Frant passions.	
1	Well what I'm saying? Well, yes because I think it's just Because of the fact that they don't feel the need to grow or change because they're safe. Yeah, but at the same time that's not self oppression.	
2	I don't feel like you're not letting yourself go outside your box true because you're safe. Whereas if you're constantly feeling oppressed or like you're not accepted and you're just at one point, you're just like fuck it. I'll try different things got nothing to lose.	
1	Oh, yeah. Fuck. Yeah and it makes you strive for more. Yeah. I tried different things. Yeah. Well, I think that that kind of deviates from what we were talking about and I think that just turns into the character of the individual because if you're constantly told that you have it on that you're good and that you don't need to do shit. Then that's on you.	
2	Then you you should I as a human's you should challenge yourself and you should want to put yourself out there and you should want to because for the most part when I meet grow the LGBT community or other women, I feel like they are so much more expressive and no themselves so much more than Just a standard hetero straight man. Oh because o because we've had to do all this self reflection we've had to do is bring oppressed by Society forces you to go outside your box and figure things out whereas if you're just accepted right away, then you're just safe in your own little box.	
1	Alright, and that's a form of ignorance because you haven't had no, I'm not in a bad way. No. No, that's not I'm not joking like that nyree, but it's a form of ignorance in the sense that there's certain struggles and	
2	And certain Concepts that they haven't had to think about but do you think that's why there's those guidelines of masculinity because they're already accepted like that. So they just stay in that safe little box like good body career. And then bam you're good to go.	
1	Oh are you saying that's why some men lack Dimension and depth to them and substance because they haven't really told that there's anything that about them that they need to build and grow and change. Yeah for so many years. I well. I mean definitely and why some of them just focus on the way they look and They have why they have that body dysmorphia and all this talk about is, you know working out and see yeah, I get that I get that. I definitely think that that's probably what it is. They probably are some people are just told that they don't need to strive and that they don't need to do anything else to change. But I also think I also want to challenge that because I think that men are the ones in society who are taught that they have more of a chance and they and I feel as though they are validated more where they're taught that they can be the pioneers and that they can do anything they put their minds to more. So than girls and their value more and their their potential is seen a lot more from an earlier age. Yeah, so that's what I have to say on that subject.	
2	Yeah, but I'd are oppressed in different ways.	
1	They are that it's a different Dynamic for each in general.	
2	They're accepted a lot better and right off the bat but in that same sense because they're so readily accepted. It makes them fearful to step outside the box because they're already accepted for you.	
1	Yes, it brings masculine. Yes, it branches off in different ways.	
2	Yeah, definitely definitely whereas if you're oppressed from the start and it's harder for you in life to be accepted at some point, even though it's harder early on when you're still trying to figure self yourself out later on in life. You kind of have that upper hand because you've learned to you know, love yourself for who you are. Yes, and you go out to discover who you actually are outside of that.	
1	I'm Russian because I know what you're talking about like you have to Win you a part of a marginalized Community. You have to take a step back and evaluate who you are your identity. Yeah, and all these things that make you you and all these things that have affected you and your struggle and your war with your inner self. So I think that in terms of speaking from a sexual orientation based point of view the LGBT community where some people are a lot more have had to be a lot more introspective and Because there are pressed. Yeah, and some people who are a lot more flamboyant or very much so extremely expressive with how they are. They are I feel as though that's their defense mechanism and their way of saying, you know what you don't accept me. So I'm going to be as gay as I fucking want and bitch Imma Be me till the day I die. And here I am and you can't do shit about it. If you don't like it suck my dick. Yes, I've mentality. Yeah, you know, and I think that it's rightfully so because you just fed these constant Has of your inadequate you're wrong. You shouldn't be like this. The shit is like is weird.	
2	It's not normal and isn't that fraying in a way though?	
1	It's I think it can be it's freeing when somebody has come to terms with who they are and accepted themselves in spring when somebody has when somebody release the shackles in the chains, but one thing on themselves, but some people will never get to that point if they weren't oppressed in the first place.	
2	You know what I'm saying? Right? I mean	
1	I mean, well if everything was okay in the world and there was no more ignorance and hate that everyone could just be who they were everybody would just be celebrated but that's not the case people are celebrated. We have to find our own celebration within our own communities because we are shunned and ostracized and others but that is where we find our love and our home and that's where we find ourselves as well and comfort and peace with who we are.	
2	I'm just thinking about My brother's for example their amazing men, but they're just such standard straight men. Yeah, where are they? They're so I don't have to say it is all be mean but good. They're just very basic straight men. Yeah and outside of their accomplishments like career wife girlfriend school. I don't know what else there is to them. You know, I would like to see them discover themselves more but it's almost like they just they feel safe with who they are now and they're accepted for it. So they don't feel the need to even Branch out, right?	
1	Right. Well, you know what? I I think that this situation this particular type of situation can be very specific for men and women, but I think that you really just described the basic human population. There's a lot of people who don't give a shit about there's a lot of people on this planet who don't give a shit about growing and changing and wanting to do better because for them their world is their own little world where they're happy with going to they're not two fives and they're happy with their wives and Husbands and their happy with just doing that and living a really normal life and that's no say to anybody but I'm just saying that could not be me. Yeah, that could not be me. I can't live up land as life like that. No offense, but I can't I'm sorry, but and you know, there's nothing wrong with it because you know, like that's your life. And if yeah, that's what makes you happy. Then by all means go ahead and do that. There's nothing wrong with that, but I think that of course And you know not to say that we're better than other people. That's not at all what I'm saying because everybody is valid in the lives that they choose and the decisions that they choose to make and what makes them happy at the end of the day, but of course as artists, we're always calling things like this into question. Oh, you're constantly wondering about the world and wanting to learn about the world and wanting to learn about other people and I think we're naturally very inquisitive people who always make a point to learn and to express ourselves wherever we go in with whatever it is that we learn and that's I think that people like us will always feel and experience so and get so much more out of life because we know that there is more to life than just going to a 9:00 to 5:00 and just settling down and just living in that little world and that little bubble for the rest of our lives because we know that there's so much more so much more, you know, and not everything can be understood and that everything could be understood and there's exactly like, for example, we can't understand that lifestyle and those people living in those life.	
2	Stiles can't really understand that so for sure but you know what times I'm with my family and they know not to talk about their 9 to 5s with me because I have no input and likewise.	
1	I can't talk about my photography to them because they literally have no input exactly just don't talk about it exactly and but at the same time I as hard as it is, you know, we're still able or not hard but you know as much as we dismiss it we can still respect people who have differences in people who lead different lives and we do and I think that's what it all comes down to it the end of the day, but do you think we talked enough about the gay community and the suppression? Oh, I was just thinking about that. We did not talk about it.	
2	I kind of went into a little bit but not in dear.	
1	Okay. So yeah, let me do my community Justice and we'll talk about this situation. So going back to the topic of masculinity within the gay community specifically. Yeah. Oh Soldier hold onto your seat belts because this is a this is you know, this was a thing until you told, you know, see this really was not a thing women don't eat Friends who are girls when I tell them this there so surprised because they don't know. I mean it's like but it's like how could you know because you're not the one in that Community, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, like so of course I shouldn't be that surprised that most of my friends are ignorant to this, but I wonder if it's the same with lesbians. I actually don't know I feel like lesbians are too though.	
2	Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So is it just a mint man thing to be like suppressing all the time? You know what I'm saying?	
1	I think so. I think I think there's This I mean there's definitely hi.	
2	I'm pretty sure lesbians have their own struggles that they go through definitely feel like they're I mean, I could be totally wrong but I feel like they're a lot more open not as superficial as yeah, it seems for because I feel like lesbians a lot more chill.	
1	Whereas men are like, oh shit hide this. Hi guys.	
2	I'm very visual people.	
1	Yeah, because which explains why because I know that there's this running joke, we're lesbians want to settle down. I don't have a quick and with gay guys. It's like being being being in a one-year relationship is like five years to a decade because we're just hella fast. I fucking everybody in gay relationships.	
2	Cheating is very common as well.	
1	Yes it is. I've an expiry I never been in a relationship before that. I have heard things people just be soaked with your worst fear, though. Nah, my worst fear is being alone. My worst fear is not being good enough, you know, I guess that could Branch off into cheating, but I'm not I mean, I'm not worried about that. I mean, of course, I haven't experienced love yet. So but so talk more about preferences in the gay community. Right? Right. So I'm I'm uses mm and like right certain body Sanders So within the gay community masculinity is a huge issue because masculinity is seen as The most desirable trait to have and it is considered the default is considered the standard and you really don't know that much about the gay male community and World until you access dating apps and things like grinder where that is, literally your gateway into our society our community and the standards that are upheld in that society. And so the more masculine you are the quote like manly are you are the more attractive you are the deeper your voice is Is the bigger your muscles are the taller you are all that stuff because it just makes you more attractive. It's seen as it you. If you have those qualities, you are closer to the quote essence of what a man is. And so there's a lot of people on so there's a lot of internalized homophobia within the gay community and a lot of people because you're taught that it's not okay to be gay. It's wrong and it's a bad thing. Yeah, and there's a lot of people who are also down low and not only that but there's Down low and deal means not out still in the closet. And even if there are people who are out, they put their thing they put things in their dating profiles like no queens or no fems and what that means is no feminine people. Yeah, and no queens Queen is obviously a term for gay men who are super flamboyant and very expressive and so we shame people and Men We shame gay men for being feminine and for coming off the surface. Away, because it's seen as ugly and undesirable and that's the craziest thing because you would think that as a community who has gone through so much shit who has gone through so much oppression that we would be this loving group of people who accept one another in all our forms, but that is not the way it is. It is not like that at all quite literally it's basically in terms of like social media and the way you come off and you know, dating and all that shit. It's quite literally like Like a competition to see who can come off as the least gay as quote the least gay whatever that means, you know less feminine. Yes less feminine more masculine because masculine men are always going to be put up to the front, you know, and and their masculine men are seen as the tops is the penetrators is the people who are like as the standard of Beauty and the most desirable and the most powerful whereas bottoms of the ones who are seen as weak effeminate and you know more slender more skinny and just Just yeah and invalidated in the long run when really you can't have one without the other. Yeah, and there's nothing wrong with living in your truth and being yeah are so many people have so much on their profile and they say like no fats. No fems o only in 2 in shape muscular guys. You asked a mask for mask. That's a very common term that you see that means I'm masculine and I'm looking for somebody who's masking and I only want somebody who's masking. He's like me there's so much of that. Islamophobia and all that rhetoric that lives within who we are as people and everybody everybody who's gay has gone through it to some extent. Yeah, you know, like it doesn't matter the level of intensity you've experienced it at but you definitely go through it and people still go through it.	
2	You know, it just clicked in my brain that analogy I made earlier where men keep themselves in that safe box because they know it's already accepted or feel like that applies to this situation as well because these For pressed gay men felt like they didn't fit into that normal box. They try to draw that box within their community. So within the gay community, they're like since we weren't accepted in that first box. We're going to draw in a second box in this community so that we could feel like we're you know casting people out of that box and we're accepted well as more masculine and you know, all that stuff, but why does there have to be a box? Why do you have to oppress others in order to feel accepted because because at the end of the day hey,	
1	eight nurses hate and hate gives birth to more hate and the same thing with ignorance people who reinforce those constructs and those Norms don't realize that they're doing it because they have internalized homophobia themselves because truth be told if somebody at like their people I pick up on these things, you know, like there's people who don't want to be seen with feminine people. There's people who don't want it within the gay community. Yeah, there's no one. Yeah, there's people who don't want to see be seen with them to people hang out with them or even be with them because it makes them look bad. But how does somebody make you if you really secure with yourself? How would they make you look bad if you were okay with yourself and okay with your identity and secure with your orientation, then why should the way somebody else comes off? Matter, how does that affect you in any way?	
2	You know that was a thing.	
1	It is a thing people may not talk about it. But it's a thing people. It's like people who you know hang out with people who look pretty yeah, you know, like, oh, there's a certain standard of what is acceptable for me to hang around you or associate myself with you.	
2	I didn't know in within the gay community that Femmes are that look down upon it is where like you would be ashamed to even be Be seen with them.	
1	Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's just things that like I've in my experience. I haven't flat. I haven't heard anybody flat out say it but you know, you feel it.	
2	You know, you feel it you feel it for like you just feel more confident with a masculine person type of a thing.	
1	No, not me.	
2	I'm just no I'm saying you as in in general me as a person. So I mean you as in a person oh a person.	
1	Oh, I guess so. Yeah come for me. I was like, no I was like, I like hanging out with a bouquet going along.	
2	That line do you feel like in the lesbian Community? They're just more open to whatever because women are just oppressed in general where it's kind of a thing where it will just accept people for who they are.	
1	I was you know, I cannot speak on that because I don't know I can't speak.	
2	I'm just conceptualizing did putting different loads up or just tell me what you think.	
1	Well from the few interactions that I've had. Well, I can't really say the same because in a with like, you know, we were talking about it before interaction with a with A straight woman and a gay male is completely different from a straight woman and a straight man, you know therefore and like when lesbians and a gay and gay dudes like come together and interact with one another that's going to be different from how lesbians are seeing with each other as whole, you know what I mean? Because they're still attracted not saying that they can't be friends, but they're still attracted to one another but or some of the ones that I've met there really chill and really cool people like I don't want to make this a gender thing, but I just feel like regardless of sexuality.	
2	Woman people more for who they are then it just seems like across-the-board men oppresses themselves or suppresses others either some reason.	
1	Well, here's the thing. I think that I don't think you can just say suffer price because the self oppression comes from it is yes, it it did not start itself, you know, it was birthed from what we were told and what we're taught. However it is Your responsibilities as a functioning human being but it just didn't listen. Listen. Yes. It is your responsibility as a human being to unlearn the shit that you've been taught as a human being it is your responsibility to sit down and say I'm not I make up a society and I'm an individual but I'm not just I'm not just I can't just say that I don't have responsibilities in changing the world and changing Society because one person does have so much power and if you refuse to Acknowledge your power. Then you give up that power and you won't be making any changes at all. You need to look within yourself and see the issues that have and you need to see the ignorance that's been planted in your heart and planted in your mind. And when you free yourself of that that's how you are able to love and interact with people in a whole new way.	
2	I'm going to lose my train of thought write it down.	
1	What was it?	
2	I was going to say I agree with you. It just seems like women are are a lot more willing to step outside that oppression like you mean they're more chill with it. Not that they're more chill is just since they're oppressed in general. They're more willing because I mean going along with the me to movement. You don't see guys who witness sexual assault standing up for The Other Woman or other men who are victims like because they're already accepted their comfortable where they are whereas women they're the ones who are oppressed. So they're more likely to just be like, fuck it. To stand up for this girl. I'm going to back her story up. I'm going to believe her because people aren't going to accept me compared to another man or another straight man. I feel like women across Society have been oppressed just as a gender so much so that they're just more willing to step outside the box and they have less to lose and that sense.	
1	Yeah, because yeah, I get what you're saying. Yeah, but then I feel like it also takes a lot for them to stand up and to be vocal because but what	
2	I'm trying to get at is it I feel like it takes a certain amount of Oppression to just say fuck it. I'm just going to yeah, go outside the box and do it. Yeah, and I feel like men just haven't been oppressed Enough by Society to just get to that point of being like fuck it besides maybe the LGBT community.	
1	Right? Right, but at the same time, I think that people have all types of pain and standards. Yeah placed upon them and there are individuals out there who free themselves of that and say fuck it. I'm just going to oh, yeah for sure. How they liberate themselves and going back to the whole oppression thing within like the gay community. I think that when you know yourself and you free yourself of all that negative shit, you're able to treat other people with respect and treat them the way that they deserve to be treated because then it wouldn't matter what somebody looks like. It wasn't matter how it the way somebody talks. It wouldn't matter about their mannerisms of the way that they look especially how muscular they are and all that shit. Yeah, because at the end of the day it really is just it's just vanity.	
2	Yeah, and that just comes down to security and insecurity.	
1	I've got nothing to do with yeah. Yeah because you taught to place importance on certain thing. Yeah, and you taught that you're not important unless you're not this unless you're not a b and c do you see that issue getting better in the gay community or no? I mean, I know you know what though? I know I actually do. You know, I met a guy an old guy one time and he was just having a conversation and he Gay guys are so vain and I was like, oh Sue. We really are and that was before I and I was like, you know Main Street. No, he was a gay man. So we just having like we were just having an awesome conversation. Like, we really just we were at a coffee shop and we were just like talking and about it and it was great. It was one of the best conversations I had that just liberated my mind because you know, he's older he is a lot more he's experienced a lot more in life. And he was also talking about how gay men have body dysmorphia with and it's just not Enough and they're just So Vain and constantly caring about how they look.	
2	Yeah, and because they're already oppressed.	
1	So they feel like they have to overcompensate and yeah, they have to overcompensate for and within their own communities. They wait. What was your original question though?	
2	You were telling me like do you feel like it's gonna get better?	
1	Oh do I feel like I'm gonna get better vanity thing.	
2	Yeah and policing one another to had on how to act and what do you feel like that's only happening in this phase because it's only recently getting more accepted so it's kind of like you can't just go from like Oppressed to being free it has to be as you're getting free. You have to face this self oppression within the community. I think we could be fully free.	
1	I think that that's how it is. But at the same time I think certain communities just have their different standards and their different norms and different values and one of the gay community's values is definitely vanity and the way you look and I do see that getting better because online under there's a know there's an active effort with advertisements and sayings to be kind to one another really. Yeah, and so and so block pages and Report pages that have racism because touching base on that. There's hella shit. Like I've seen how the shit I've been treated with micro aggressions and racism to ongoing. Yeah where people just like where people just emasculate Asians and think Asians are all the bottoms and just a whole nother. Oh, that's a whole and that's a whole nother topic of the time but it's hella people who A skate them and say like I've saw one profile that said why are there so many Asians on here bitch? You're the babysitter and San Jose. What the fuck is you talking about? For real move your ass to like fucking I don't know Idaho's want to see more white people or some shit, you know, like there's been an effort to there's advertisements that encourage you to report races profiles and all that stuff and I as someone who is just a user of that app recognizes. As that effort and appreciated. Yes because it's a huge step in the right direction. And it's this entity not just saying not dismissing their platform and saying oh, well, that's we can't help it if racist people use our app. Yeah, they're taking a step forward. They're putting their foot on the ground and saying no, you know what we understand that we are the number one default. We are the most used app amongst his community that's good. And we are going to do something about it. We're going to stand up against hate and ignorance and we're going to do something about it. That's really	
2	Self-aware it is. I'm glad you said that because they have that on Tinder to because I got an email from Tinder we do. Yeah, they had a thing that you could click into and the title was how to properly break up with someone and not just go stem. So they wow, they're very aware of people are on here. They have feelings too. So if you decide to, you know date each other talk or whatever Meetup you have to still have respect for each other good. No, it's just I didn't read it, but I read the title and Like the general first few sentences of the email and I just thought that was really and it's still stayed in your mouth. Yeah, and it got brought up in my mind as soon as you had that story. Yeah.	
1	Yeah, I think at the end of the day just be kind. So just don't be a fucking asshole UK just be open-minded be you know, empathetic towards other people. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. I couldn't agree more and do you have anything else to say I guess going along with that?	
2	Preference thing I think it's okay to have your preferences just as long as it doesn't turn into discrimination and ignorance and just be open-minded to people that you wouldn't typically be attracted to but if you are open-minded and it's still not working out because you don't like their personality then you know, that's fine. At least you really like open to it.	
1	That's a valid reason as long as you try as long as you keep an open mind as long as you are an open and reasonable person.	
2	Everything is good because I have dated. People outside my preference just to give them a shot and I realize I just didn't like their personality.	
1	So and I just like ended it because of that but it's not because of how they look exactly like you tried and you know, and you really made an effort. Yes. Exactly.	
2	Well, do you have anything else to say I guess for those who are listening? I would like to hear back from my fellow lesbian listeners is their oppression within your community. I would like to hear about that just because we don't have That much knowledge.

Please give us an insight into the constructs of your community what you guys go through certain struggles that you guys deal with and how you guys interact with one another all that good stuff.

1	So, how's the vibe between y'all?	
2	Yeah, and I just want to challenge our mail listeners regardless of your sexuality to yeah, be more expressive with your who you are regardless of the constructs of society and what they deem as more masculine and whatnot.
