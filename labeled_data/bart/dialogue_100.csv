1	I love it. I love this. I really do. We've had a few questions from people and a lot of the weird random diems have to do with us and like the most absolutely hammered we've ever been It seems like we give the impression that we're drinking which we are we do. We do give that impression and I just want to say that yes, we enjoyed a drink but like we don't we don't do that every day, and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. No, it's we're working on it. We're working on our no so as we're drinking wine, so no, so basically a lot of them had to do. With stories of us and like the most Hammer we've been together and we were thinking and I said to myself. Well, I mean the most hammered I've ever been just hasn't been with her. Yeah. We kind of came to that conclusion that like we have been very much hammered together college high school, but God well no together. No, I know but you mean other than like being together. I like we're going to tell some stories and one of my stories of the most drunk. I've ever been has been in high school. I started early start him young start him young I really did. Like I had like a lot of things in high school, which mine was in college mines mines pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to start? I'll start. All right. Okay our love. Okay. So this was when I was 20 years old, so I wasn't 21 yet and I feel like when I turn 21 Unlike just a side note like I tamed down a little bit. That's not like as like yeah. Yeah, you're 21 like drinking song is fun anymore. Yeah, like don't get me wrong. There was no thrill. I mean there was a thrill they're still a threat or so, but this was back when it was like Wild and Woolly. Okay, so I was 20 and it was about three months before I was going to be 21 years old. So a bunch of my friends at that time. We're turning 21. It was junior year. Everybody was like had that calendar out, you know what I mean when like they were had like the 21 countdown. Oh, yeah, three months two months one month. So my friend had a birthday in January and she decided to hold it at this club called story bill and it's in Boston and it's it used to be super fun. I don't really know what it's like now, but I said to myself I'm going to go and it's going to be awesome and we're gonna we're gonna get in there and I had a fake ID at the time and it was a Real a real fake ID if that makes any sense. It was a real human being I had a girl from Suffolk who just like totally hooked me up like she had dark hair and blue eyes and just like she just let me have it. I gave her 50 bucks to get a new license and she just she was awesome. She was the MVP. So I had I had an ID and at the time I was eating a guy who was older so he was over 21 and I said, you know, we I really want to go to this. I want to celebrate her birthday. 'The day he said sure the day of the birth day comes I was I remember I like legitimately like of course went Forever 21 and like found a sexy jumpsuit with like a super crazy v-neck in it and I was like, I'm hungry. Yeah. I was like, I like feeling myself.	
2	Oh, oh literally and I wish I could do that.	
1	Don't do it a flat. I can I can roll a tongue do it?	
2	Okay.	
1	Okay, bitch. So anywho, so I get my jumpsuit I'm out here like flexing my poor ex-boyfriend of time heat or boyfriend at the time. He was as sick as a dog. So he was like, I'm not drinking tonight you get hammered, do you and of course I'm like, yes, I will we get to a friend's house and her and I take like 12 tequila shots within 30 minutes and I am thrive. Living like literally thriving I'm having so much fun. And so we're like, let's call an Uber. Let's do it. And she's like one more tequila shot. I was like sure so we down it he's looking at me like I have ten heads. He's like this girl cannot drink because I've literally I've known that I'm like, I cannot hold my liquor like, oh, you're a small human. Yeah. So well, I was even smile my God. I was even smaller than like, it was crazy. Like now I'm lightweight. Yeah, so it was so bad. I would have like three glasses of wine and I'm still guy still get hammered after three glasses of wine now, but yeah, so it was it was wild. So like imagine me after 12 tequila shots. I'm out here like twerking and like climbing the walls hanging.	
2	I'm sorry.	
1	Also on Tuesday night literally like no longer human just like crawling up and like hanging from the ceiling the rafters, but like literally living my best life. So we're like, let's call now. Uber she lived in Brookline or something. I'm sorry. How old were you I was 20 or 20? Yes 20. So in the my friend, I won't even named her she was 22 so neither 20 as well, not 22 but 20 as well 20 also 20 and she she had a fake but I think it was like a fake fake. I don't remember either way. I don't think I've seen her since then because	
2	Probably good thing. I remember I don't she wasn't someone I saw all the time.	
1	Anyways, like it was wicked random. So we again the Uber we're on the way. I remember we were like jamming to like Kanye. He's like new life of Pablo album came out. I was like feeling myself young listening to famous and it was just we are thriving and so then we get there and we wait in line and in line she was like, are you gonna go? When if if I don't get in and vice versa and I was like, well I'm going in like it's her birthday. Yeah, and she was like, you're gonna leave me and I was like, well, I don't know like let's just see if we get in I get in she hasn't. Yeah, he doesn't knock it in I well let's talk to the thing is is my boyfriend went in first because I didn't want him to be involved with like time. Yeah. I didn't want him to be involved and we didn't want to be involved with like The under-21 bullshit right? Because like it's just not cool. And so I was like you go in like get whatever get your coat checked and do you it's the dead of winter. I'm in like a strapless jumpsuit and last time he high heel in Turin is you kind of Wonder I'm isn't though. Like, I don't know. I'm literally walk home. You're like frostbite. You've walked 20 miles and you're just like and you wake up like purple and you don't feel anything like hi. Good morning. Hello. No, so he goes in I go in I turn around she's denied but I'm in okay. So I was and I got in I was like girl didn't I was like, I'm sorry, so she standing out there and I was like, I'll call you an Uber. I had it connected to my Dad's credit card at the time and I was like, I'll call you an Uber and she was like, I don't want an Uber I want to get in and I said well, I don't really know there's nothing I can do so, I don't know how long she stood. Out there, but I went in. It was the year of being a selfless bit like selfish bitch. I just wanted to get him on all you did when you weren't 21. All you wanted to do is get in like you're gonna leave your friends, but it's like hard to even think. I mean, I'm only 20 years but it's so hard to think about when I wasn't 21. Yay. I like don't because you literally had to like fight to get into places or even like pay them. I give them like throw my like, I remember Haley like let me use her. I think it was Haley. Yeah someone let me use their ID one time. Thank God it's it's stressful. Yeah, you got any of like makes it more fun accomplish this massive feat. So like I'm not turning around. Also, I was wasted so like sorry, but then I see a couple of friends from home. I know my friend won't mind if I shut like shout him out his friend. His name is Devon. He he came in he visited he's a Ellie stop eating the bed. All right. We met we need to sell your bed. Yeah, we need to do a lot of things. We need to train her Ellie. Don't lay on the phone. Okay, so she'll lay right here. She'll hang out all that her belly. So then I take photos with him. He was living in San Francisco at the time. He he's a flight attendant for I think United. Yeah United and so, you know, I was just so happy to see him. I was so happy to be with my friends. I was so excited. And I got completely wasted like Beyond life my boyfriend at the time went to the bathroom. He was gone for maybe three minutes. Like I don't really know he could have been gone longer and I just thought he like I don't know what happened. I thought he was gone for hours. He wasn't though and he was like Andrea. I literally just went to the bathroom. It's time to go home. It was like 1:30 in the morning Nicki Minaj was playing. People were twerking. It was just getting wild and people weren't working. I know and I never I never learned how to twerk. Like I'm either I like tried, but which is Barren because I've been like a dancer and cheerleader. I should know how to do that. But I should have Kaylee come on in like give an example or like give up a step by side Kaylee green. She teaches teachers teach you how to twerk. I need that I've other friends I can talk to and I just like can't like, you know what that's actually a lie. I use when twerking was for a school. I definitely get to work and now I'd like got old and I can't anymore. I'm just if I break a hip same so hey, I'll I'll finish my story so real quickly. So Taylor can get onto hers, but we leave we're in an Uber I of course get the spins. I don't really remember why but I was like, I'm gonna fucking puke and so then we get out of the car. We're on Comm Ave for like by bu I get out of the car my ex gets out of the car and he's like bitch. What the fuck and he's horrified Ellie. Does he growl at you know, she was trying to play you were trying to play. It's okay baby, and she and I rip off my seven-inch heels like stilettos like it was not a drill. I pulled him off like they weren't going back on then. There and he the minute he saw my heels coming off. He was like God damn it. She's down for the count like eventually, you know, we call multiple Ubers multiple cabs. They won't let us in because I'm blind different and being probably psychotic and cops show up and they're like, hey, what are you guys doing? And I don't know why this is the first thing my underage self decided to say, but I was like, I'm not	
2	21 I like screamed it on the top of my lungs to the COS just took time not and they were like can we see an ID? And I was like, I gotta fake fucking ID motherfucker.	
1	It was so bad and I was just being like so just oh my God, I was literally being the worst human being so tell everyone I would do it was literally like talk about like some salt to the Earth like real awesome.	
2	Thanks. I could be on	
1	What's on Cops and it's so luckily. God blessed me that night. Oh no, and the woman was like I have a daughter who is also not 21 and does and reminds me of her to a tee. We're gonna call a cab for you guys, but you're going to go to her house. And and he had to prove out lucky. I know right? It could have been some douche mother. But so I know I got in trouble underage, but we'll get into that. So yeah, I mean they called a cab and I got home and like went to bed and woke up in the morning and this is the real kicker. This is where it gets to be like genuinely like and I didn't drink for weeks because of it because I was just so disgusted with myself. I woke up and my foot is stuck to the sheets of my bed, you know, and that's raunchy and I was like don't roughhouse with her. She gets really viable. We got to be easy without okay Elliot easy easy easy slipping into and I ripped the sheets off of me because I was like, what's wrong? And I was in a legit pool of blood and I had no toenail.	
2	Bitch, I was like I was like, where did my toenail go?	
1	And I was horrified like legitimately harm Antonio. Let's just it took literally your for it to grow back. Like this was just the gift that kept on giving Which toenail my big toenail not even just like the pink naughty like mine like it falls off.	
2	Sometimes that's not normal. Oh behind anyone else? Okay.	
1	So back in those times when I've ever been there's plenty of other times when I've woke up with eggs on my head and regret and I don't drink Tennessee Honey whiskey either but so many weird memories, but that one that one really, you know Takes the Cake that one seriously Takes the Cake if we don't acknowledge her she'll go back to like licking the Kelly's like being a dean. And yeah, she needs she's trying to company. Okay. So tell your story that was a great story. Um, so I we each have two stories. So yeah, I'll tell mine then you tell your next one and then I'll tell my next one. I'm going to start off with a college story. So I had a couple girlfriends my I think it was like my sophomore year of college and we I want to say it was like st. Patrick's Day or something like that. Maybe it wasn't I could be making that up but we all like got super dressed up like curled our hair like put a bunch of makeup on like how to hot outfit we frickin wore heels like we were doing the damn thing and one of my roommates from college we will call her. I don't know. We will call her Mary that way marriage a week Mary. That wasn't her name. But we're going to call her Mary. So Mary had a friend will call this friend Bethany. So Mary had a friend named Bethany and we saw a couple of my girlfriends and Mary who was my roommate we went to this party. Like it was like this big thing. And so I we got to this party and you're having a great time. You know, we were we were all drunk as fuck living our best life's I would do anything to go back to those days, but maybe not and so Mary's friend Bethany. Are we following along Mary Mary?	
2	I'm not just kidding me. Mary's friend, Bethany	
1	Thought I was a different person and me being all dolled up with my makeup my heels my hair like it was curled. My hair was like curled like I was like really doing the thing. So Bethany thought I was some girl that she didn't like Bethenny was drunk as fuck. I like forgive her it's fine. Like she's been arrested like 10 times I Castleton like she no longer. I think she got like expelled from Casselton. It's fine. But so be bad, did he so interested? Um, well, yeah Bethany thought that I was a different girl like and me and Bethany like got along just fine, but she thought I was somebody else and so she poured a whole bottle of wine on my head a party and everybody just look here's Bethany like she'll Bethany. Yes. And so every this bitch pulls all pours a whole bottle of champagne on my head at a party in front of probably Hundred people and I was like, oh, this is an embarrassing or anything. I like go home and cry. But so I look over and she was like, oh my God, like she was probably unlike so many drugs and alcohol the bathroom. Okay. Goodbye. So what was I saying? So, yeah, so she turns around that. She's like like so turn out of her mind that she did say sorry. She was like, oh my God, like she didn't know it was she did not know that that was you whatever whatever she thought that you were somebody else and I was like, I think I was just speechless. I like got home and just showered because I was I had a whole bottle of champagne all over me Meanwhile. My boyfriend was living in a double-wide trailer with Three other men and I basically lived there too. And so I like go back to his place and like shower. Oh my God. It was just it was bad. And I think that was like the same night I could be wrong. But I think that was the same night that girl like got expelled. I have no hard feelings against that either like we're all young and do dumb shit. There's no hard feelings, but I just think that this story till this day is funny as fuck and I'm the one that got a whole bottle of champagne pour it on me and I still think it's funny. So love Bethenny Bethenny Bethenny and Mary. I just know I don't want to say names but Honestly hilarious though. Yeah, their name should be married. Bethany know their names will not be exposed. That's their real names though. Mary and Bethany probably this. So anyway, so yeah, I'm a little bit shorter, but my next one will be good Andrea back to you. All right. I'm going to throw it back to high school. The one that I told you before that I wanted to say. I feel like I'm not going to say it now because it's funny but there's I have a better one. Okay. Yeah, I'm not saying I have like so many stories that I can't even think of one satoko because there's a lot my second see this have some this wasn't the drunkest I've ever been but it was probably the most like ignorant drunk I've ever been in. I was in high school. So it was my junior year of high school. So apparently I just have this thing with Junior years. I just enjoy just junior year is a good time. Yeah. I was like, I'm 16. I'm wild. I'm crazy 16 and 20.	
2	Yeah. I was just like feeling myself at all times both great ages good.	
1	Eh has always a good age. And so I was living in Beverly at the time and I was like sort of talking to this guy and like this is a common theme every girl in their life has a crush on a drug dealer. Every girl maybe not you Taylor. You're a good person. Everybody has a thing for one at least. Well, not are you talking like selling weed or selling? Oh, yeah just weed. Well Cody did that all throughout College. Sorry to put you on blast, but mommy we got to do that sometimes so kind of do like you can't always file your taxes with your true income.	
2	Actually, I was like obsessed with this boy.	
1	He was like huge and just selling weed in my hometown and I was like, I'll do anything to make him like me and all my girlfriends from high school like like please note like I went to like pretty much a private school like it was just honestly the people were not the type to like to just be disgusting like me. I'm not a It's cool person. I was just stuck in a setting like that. Yeah, I could not imagine going to private school public school was flow improves or actually you did not belong there. No, I didn't Harvest like so and I was like, let's get fucked up.	
2	So I just was a horrible influence.	
1	But basically we were like going camping in the spring.	
2	So like it was 50 degrees. It was good.	
1	Old but we were like let's go camping. There's this like camping place in Salem. I don't even know where it was. We drive there we park where would like a huge group of people obviously, my drug dealer beu is there and probably selling the whole time. This is like a business trip for him and I'm like, he loves me he's here for me and he loves you little did he know he ever did it's fine. And though wouldn't know yeah a sane literally have no idea if he's even still with us. I happiest but peace and blessings. But so we get all hammered and I feel like in high school. That's just when like it's not even funny now when I think about it, but back then it was hilarious. We have this watermelon, and we were going to smoke out of it and it wasn't working.	
2	Like my friend at the time, I'll name her. I'll name her Mary Beth. Okay out of just Mary Beth and she was like crack it off my head. Like let's fucking open this shit and I legitimately rocked this watermelon office girls had went down it did break. So like if You could imagine the force from like sixteen-year-old me the fourth was like very much the force was with me. That's crazy.	
1	So yeah, and it broke open and then we were like covered in like obviously watermelon juices and we went swimming in the Salem Harbor ask naked and I have this one photo. I have no idea where it is today. Oh my God. Wait, I'm sorry real quick. Aye aye you just you when you said swimming in the harbor you Just made me remember a story and this is probably one of the drunkest I've ever been. I'm just going to like say it real quick. But I this just reminded me of a time. I'm sorry.	
2	This is like so funny.	
1	This reminds me of a time where me and one of my friends we were so drunk like and we were trying to get to a party from this like damn. It's called the Chittenden Dam and we had to like Get across this Lake to get to like this like fire or whatever and so me and my friend at like midnight thought it would be a great idea to take these floaties this like I remember you telling me this story. We took these floaties to this part instead of like a bow instead of anything. We took like this like a little legit like blow up floaty and paddled our way and the floaty was deflating in the middle of the lake at like freaking 12 a.m. And I had a panic attack and like cried and almost drowned and but we made it.	
2	You made it to the fire.	
1	Yeah, that was just a quick soaking wet.	
2	You were like, I'm right here boy that man. Jesus Christ, he's like, where's your friend? You're like, I don't know she Drew her she's dead. But I'm alive below my God.	
1	Now we both made it. I was the one that almost died. But anyways, I'll continue. I just closed my story is like such a high school thing to happen. So like we were all sleeping in tents or whatever. I'm freezing cold my underwears freezing cold because we weren't like naked make it like I had a bra no underwear on I was feeling myself. It was great. And so I know I know it. Okay sis High School. I know I have Joe finished lacrosse season. I was like, ooh Flex that Bobby likes.	
2	Yes.	
1	So then we like I don't even know there was this other girl there and of course, I thought he was my boyfriend like obviously he didn't think so nor had he ever asked me or shown any signs of affection towards made him your boyfriend. You were like, you're going to be well well in that case if let's say he's my boyfriend.	
2	He cheated on me that night.	
1	He he went into a different tent with a different girl. I've been there and laid with her. I don't know what they did. I heard things. I didn't see anything. I didn't look I was laying with Mary Beth love that and then he comes into my tent an hour later and tries to snuggle. I've literally haven't liked same exact you motherfucker session before I don't like pretend. Yeah High School literally pretended to let him snuggle me. In the morning, he was like, do you feel like smoking and chilling later? And I was like, actually I think you should go mother fuck yourself. You shouldn't eat. Yeah. I did. I did buy weed from him after that. But like it was not like loving him. You should have choked him. I would have I didn't want to like, honestly, I was too young. You never too young.	
2	Nope.	
1	So second-story Forte.	
2	All right.	
1	No, so I know not the only one but Sis got a drinking ticket in high school. You did what I told you this. I don't think so. Yeah, I did there was like a couple people at my school that did and of course I was one of them like are you surprised? Are you I mean, no, so I was at this kids graduation party. I was like a junior. This kid was a senior. He had like a big party for his graduation and everyone was drinking. I wasn't the only one and a lot of I a lot of Vermont parties. I remember being in high school and cops coming to all of our parties. Is that just like a Vermont thing or did that happen to you too? It happened in college, but This happened in high school for us like in the middle of the woods in high school. Like I can only think of one time cops came and I'm trying to think of like what I did like it wasn't it wasn't anything that like wasn't handled like we were outside and they basically were like stop drinking like we have a ghoul can annoy. It was like a noise complaint like a neighbor called and said it was too loud. But like they never checked if anybody was drinking know there was like multiple parties. I got breathalyzed at in high school. Seriously. Yeah, that did not happen to me. I know that was like a thing and people like me that's why I like Hitler. It sounds bad that like not a drinking ticket underage. Whatever whatever but like it was so common. Like it happened to like a handful of people. I know not everybody but I happen to be one of them are just special. I am special help. So how I got the drinking ticket it was A friend's graduation party, he was a senior and he you know graduating high school. He had a big party a bunch of people from different ages went like this is like a pretty big. I remember it being a lot of people there and the cops show up and everybody like this is such a typical like Vermont thing. I know you all can relate like we just like all run in the woods like this was like the thing for Grant away. Oh my God, this was like a thing. Like we all just ran like ran into the woods. We slept into the abyss like and I was just like following somebody but like sis was so drunk. She couldn't like keep up solo me and like my like, I don't even know I was like trying to keep up like trying to hang beer in my hands like running. I'm wrong. I was like I got this I was like I got this And then of course, of course it was like I can't remember who I was with. I think I was like with some guy but we got caught and the cop was like come this way with me and you know, I was always taught that if a cop, you know catches you running you, don't try to fight it you just go along you go with him you apologize and that's what I did. So we went with him was like a group of like five kids and like we were the only girl So yeah, Jesus.	
2	Are you surprised no also know.	
1	Um, so like we all got caught whatever I am like crying to this cop.	
2	I was like, please like my Cheerleading Coach can't know like she will kick me off the team. I must like a know I was bad trailer.	
1	So I guess there is a good part to the story. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm just looking at my notes and I had a couple different stories and I just looked at this and there was a time where I fell asleep in one of my best friend's driveways in high school. But other than that that was a whole other story, but we're not going to get into that. But yeah, so I'm like crying to this cop and they like clearly tell that I am struggling and so as I know from this point is that I have a drinking ticket and when you go to drinking ticket, I think you need to Like 30 days until they call you because you need to like go to these classes so you can like you like path I be in a yes at 16 years old. No, but listen to what happened, I actually got pretty lucky. So they're supposed to call within 30 days. And if they don't call you, then you're like off the hook. They like forget about you. So that's what happens me. But if they did call me I would have had to do all these classes. I would have had to pay like a huge fine, but they never called me. Oh my god. So let's assume I'm fine. There's bigger and better things to conquer. I know I think I like Even Lee was like people doing heroin. Oh, yeah, and I was just like drunk off of two bears at 16. Like I was fine. Yeah. I feel like in high school like drunkenness was very different than drunkenness in college. Like I got hammered and lost my toenail and didn't remember. Yeah, but for me a school without it happen, I would have seemed very much remembered. Yo, I don't know my high school was pretty like it's funny because I got into a relationship with Cody the my freshman year of College so like I'm not trying to saying this like lame in college because I wasn't like I still want out and shit but in high school like I think like I don't know our fucking high school was pretty wild like I had some of my wildest times in high school, but also in college, so I think it's like pretty definitely I would say training College. Yeah. No, I think I hit it early in high school for sure, but I do think like equally I've had just this crazy times in college then I didn't High School. I had to get my eggs for me in high school was like a thing thing. Like I was smoked I was so against weed for the long. I don't think I had like my first oh my God, my first so bad like blonde or whatever J anything until Earth smoked out of a bowl. So I was in like 11th grade I used to but I got drunk guy in like seventh grade. So I used to go to my car on my lunch break when I was in high school and literally roll a joint and walk in. Oh, yeah our like history and just like Oh, yeah of weed and no one would ever say anything because they were scared my like whole high school did that was so bad. So we have one quick interview today.	
2	It's our first interview.	
1	We are so excited. We have been literally begging this woman to get on for at least 15 minutes. So we have a few questions for her, please, please kindly welcome our beloved. Guest you want to shout her out Andrea's mother?

1	Okay. You want to ask her the first one? Sure. I'll pick one. All right since as of right now I am Balling on a budget like we talked about literally every single day because I cried you what are some good? meals you would make on a budget or would you suggest Okay, so	
2	As far as cooking goes do you want to talk about cooking for one first? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what's your I'm going to talk about cooking tips for people on their own what to buy and how the faith? Yeah. Yeah, we're not going to go alone. I like everyone else. I had a budget. I knew my total monthly net salary and I knew my expenses whatever I had left was for food entertainment in the inevitable birthday present. Yes. Yeah. I had my money in a credit union where every month they took out a certain amount and it was deposited into what I refer to as my rainy-day fund. Okay, when my yeah, it was a great thing on my car insurance bill came in once a year. It came out of the rainy day fund if I got a medical bill it came out of the rainy day fund saving it's important. Easy, but if you have a little stash of funds when something out of the ordinary occurs get a flat tire or something happens to your car, you know, whatever any little thing you have the money to cover it and it doesn't ruin your monthly budget. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great thing to have for Christmas presents to shopping. Say that again. Where did you go food shopping. I used to go to either the Stop and Shop or Star Market. Okay, the term Market isn't when I was I was living in Roslindale. Okay. Yeah, what's a good? Say that again. What's a good one a good cheat meal other than Ramen like a good meal. You know what when I was growing up I was growing up when I was living by myself, and I didn't want to cook but I happen to love. I love baked potatoes. Love them. That's what I go when I would do believe it or not. Open up the baked potato throw the mushrooms and peppers on top with a little bit of cheddar cheese. And it was delicious. I also used to do that. I would put a put it in a pita pocket with some cheese on it. I also own. Oh my God, hold on. We're calling her. Hold on technical difficulties.	
1	Oh my god.	
2	Well, I don't know what happened. It's finally so sorry.	
1	No, it was me. I was trying to get to our questions and we accidentally hung up on you.	
2	Why especially when it comes to fruits and vegetables you think you can eat this stuff? It goes bad very quickly. And if it's very expensive these days unless you know, you're definitely going to be eating it. Don't buy it. You got to have a plan plan your week out. Yeah. The other thing is cleaning supplies are wrong. So they're very expensive. If it's on sale you see, you know, whatever to use vacuum cleaner toilet paper whatever it's on sale and you have the extra money by it if you Don't don't don't do it as far as good meals on a budget if you like chicken in the sauce on sale by enough to freeze it just when you buy it get it break it down put it in the freezer don't want to put it in the fridge because then you end up throwing it away. Hmm. We've all gotten so bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you can make you know a lot in a Crock-Pot and then you can break, you know, eat it 193 it down into little into the little meals and throw it in the freezer. Yeah, and then you can have it for leftovers. You can bring it for lunch. You can do whatever you want with it.	
1	All right, let's go thank some good Insight now you ask your next question today. Alright, so the next question. Is what are two things you would tell yourself in your 20 when you are 20 years old and your early 20s.	
2	So the first thing I would say is take advice from someone whose opinion opinion you value.	
1	Okay, that's a good one.	
2	Yeah, don't don't take advice from somebody who just you don't let anybody who doesn't care about you somebody who cares about you and somebody who knows what they're talking about. The other thing I would say is don't sell yourself short. Try new things. Don't be afraid to go for something. Ready for it. Yeah, you'd be amazed at what you can do when you have two most people most people rise to the occasion. And the other thing is don't don't feel bad. If you don't know what you want to do. I had no idea what I wanted to do. So I went to a Julia business school, which that's what most women did in my day. I got my associates degree and I became a legal secretary. Yeah, you know it all worked out fine, but when I look back on it now. Yeah, I wish my parents had pushed me to go to a four-year College. I wished I had become a vet or something along those lines something to do with the animals. But to be honest, it's hard to know what you want to do when you enter college at the age of 18. Yeah, you have any regrets? I do and I regret is that I wished I had gone to a four-year College. I wished I had moved away from my parents home and get that. I think my life would have been totally different. Maybe I would have become a bit. Maybe who knows? Yeah. Sure.	
1	I think that you wouldn't have had me.	
2	Well, I would have had a child. It wouldn't have been you. Yeah, I've been somebody else. I would've been better off. All right, um next week that week does that To the next question.	
1	Yeah, but he which one do you want to pack? We have a few? Um, well, I was gonna never mind. Do you have a number and I was going to say do you have a question that's not on the list? Um, no, I like was going to say something and now I totally forgot but it's fine. I'm sure I'll remember it soon. What's the next one? Let's do number four. Okay. Yeah, this is another one which I think a lot of people our age are feeling right now. I know that I'm fearing does life really get any better or is it a shithole the time? Yeah, is it just increasingly going to get worse because it has been	
2	Week has been Che well, okay the answer to their question I think is obvious. It's definitely up to you. Whether it's better you look around at your older siblings and your parents and most of you will see that it does get better. Okay, Julia look at them. Yeah. I know. I think I yep. I think the hardest stage to be but definitely the most exciting is your twenties. If you have a good education which both of you do and a good head on your shoulders. Most of the time you will be 20. Yeah the important part of being young and learn From your mistakes. Yeah, listen, because it listen to this sentence. This is very important good judgment comes from experience. And experience well that camp comes from bad judgment. Yes. Say it louder for the people in the back. There's no people in the back row in my bedroom that comes from bad judgment. So every time something happens, that's not good you get to learn from And need to be honest with yourself. Don't blame others for your mistakes. Come clean. Even if it's only with yourself make the changes necessary to succeed and don't be afraid to change direction if you're unhappy.	
1	P alright, I believe that too. And also I think like you learn from like you can't appreciate the good if you've never been through bad situations Stripes, right?	
2	That's right. That's 100% Correct. You look around you look at other people and what they're going through and then that's when you realize how lucky you are.	
1	Yeah, that's true. Yeah, what's that saying about the person who's complaining about having no shoes and then he sees a man with no feet.	
2	That's right.	
1	Yeah. Do you know that I don't Yeah, I heard as someone said to me once and I was like you got me. Alright. So the last thing is we want you to talk about your business for a few minutes and tell the audience what you do and where and what inspired you the most.	
2	Okay, so a needle filter but it is that means that means that I make jewelry and other items from wool roving wool roving is wrong. Whoa. It's right from the Sheep. It's been cleaned car. Added which makes it straight and then dyed into you know, a thousand different shades of colors. I was introduced to needle felting in 2003 by my very close friends foo yung it Potter in the Adirondacks. She had on a beautiful Needle felted necklace that she made is to make me one. She pretty much said no, you can make it yourself. She pulled out some roving showed me how to make a bead and the rest is history. I fell in love with it. I started my own little business. It's called ourselves creation. Yeah, I love doing it. I have expanded my knowledge over the years by taking some classes and other forms of felting needle felting wet felting hat making stuff like that. I do a lot of shows during the year. I have my own website. What does that learning to build screams now, you gotta spell it out.	
1	So Creations, that's a our TFE. Alt Creations cre a tion s.com.	
2	That's right. Check her out.	
1	Christmas is coming. Yeah. Yeah and dog jacket.	
2	I do a lot of shows but I have to say learning to felt is one of the most rewarding things I've done. I've met so many other artists that I've become really close with none of whom I would have met without going to self. They would have been something I wouldn't have been doing shows. I would assume that all these people so it's been really rewarding and I love doing it.	
1	I think they're calling ya gotta love what you do.	
2	Do you feel fulfilled in this life.	
1	Do I would feel fulfilled in this life so far?	
2	Yeah, I do. I mean you got a lot more living to do anyway, so you're like to get five more cats, but honestly,	
1	I plan on having an animal farm.	
2	So we'll see that's that's I do wish I had done something with animals, but maybe at some point when I when I stopped helping not get involved with I ever become rich and famous from this podcast you and I can open up an animal shelter.	
1	Okay, just me and you sister actually with Taylor took me to an animal shelter Let's do an animal shelter.	
2	Have you get to have that the problem with the animal shelters is money. Yeah, I think about that. I would yeah, that's not that's an issue right now. So you ask me one more question. Do you want it or do you want the answer? We're not we don't even really have time we got Nobody, can I steal like you? Oh, okay.	
1	Well, you know what it is worth it. It's worth it. It's an awesome question. What is it like being a first-time mom and having your first baby yikes.	
2	I'll go say go cook very quickly. Okay, to be honest with you the scariest part of being a first-time mother is childbirth itself.	
1	Oh, yeah, that's like my biggest fear in life is childbirth.	
2	I don't know how you know what I want to have the baby is totally goes away from their mind. That was to come out and find it was already. I came as a rock from the beginning.	
1	I yeah, I've literally been a shitstorm know I came out and I had a conehead it's okay. I was like Rapture on my arms back.	
2	So now you have this little person to take care of so pretty much your own wants and needs they go on the back burner and you put everything into this little treasure My Little Treasure is real and that pretty much left for a very long time. Time Karen's put their child's needs first. Yeah, they should and every sneeze and cough from that little person makes you nervous but every smile and every jiggle makes it all worthwhile. Oh you sentimentalize bitch. There's nothing more rewarding than that there really, isn't you could you could be president of the United States, but nothing nothing. To me and I think both parents feel that way is watching your child grow mature. Do things go out on their own. I mean, it's amazing. It really is.	
1	Yeah, that'll be a fun time in life. But I'm like good for another couple years. Yeah.	
2	I'm sad I think both of you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're gonna get our shit in order open up our animal shelter, then we'll have kids together probably. Yeah or just dogs and cats.	
1	Yeah. We're just a ton of animals, honestly. Well, thank Thank you for calling or answering us and sorry we hung up on you where yeah, that was that was ratchet of us say goodbye to our little nine-to-fivers.	
2	Goodbye. Nine to five rows. Thanks for coming by Mom. All right. I'll talk to you guys later. Love you. Love you, too. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks for that. Oh, she's so awesome. And you know what like goal.	
1	She is such a soul and I know that like every single person is going to look at this interview and be like another mom saying it's going to get better and everything's going to work out. She's different. She's different like she has been through and the advice of like don't take advice from people that don't that was the best. That was the best thing I've heard because there are so many people in my oh, I'm sure oh my God, there's a lot of people that have input on your life. But but you don't really really like them and really have no idea what you're going through. In your personal life. Yeah, so if they don't know if this is a good quote if they don't know you personally don't take it personal. There. It is. Alright bang. So this is like kind of funny because we just had a like deep discussion and now we're going to talk about sex. So we're all over the place. Yeah. I mean honestly, we just this is a shit storm, but we're doing our best but we these questions are actually kind of amazing and there's also a story that we can share. Yes, that's us Also, it's also just horrifying. All right. So, um, we're not announcing and everybody's in everyone's Anonymous a lot of girlfriends contributed So, yeah, thank you to our girlfriends. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks ladies. So the first question is do colleges actually have sex parties or is that just in the movies? No, at least. I'm not any I know about and I am I probably would not ever want to go to that because that's a little scary. Yeah. No, I mean I've never really heard of that. I've never had the invite. Oh God. Yeah. No, I haven't had an invite. I have heard and sort of maybe seen some weird things but I've never like I think the closest thing to a sex party has been like seeing people in a club like just all touching each other and really having yeah, like literally having sex like, oh my God this greatly. Yeah, so like, okay like that's all but that's not even a sex party. That's all I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really know a little bit more private about my sex life. So saying this is like weird for us to talk about. Yeah, I well I thought it would be we thought it would be funny. So yeah, I think it's hopefully just in movies or if like if you're in a public school Define sex party orgies. Yeah, like I don't really like her but cut in my nose. Yeah. I mean maybe some people do I think if you go I'll ever Arizona or I think it was those big crazy schools. Like we went to Suffolk. I was still in school in Boston. Yeah. I went to school in Vermont and we did not have that experience. No, I think I think that's just in the movies girl. I think that's a little let's all pray together that it's just in the mood. Let's pray. The next question comes from one of my girlfriends and I think that it's just like such an amazing thing so should body count be a topic of discussion in relationship. Oh, I think if somebody asks your body count, they should be prepared to probably not be the happiest because if they're asking their Curious and they're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I mean Yeah, or they just want to know so that they have it against you without saying they want to hold it in you know, but I'm also the type of person I'd ask because I don't care I've asked every not that I've dated a bunch of guys because I haven't but everyone I've pretty much been with. Oh I was asked to I've said how like what's your number because I like especially people I've dated because what am I saying? I've had like one serious boyfriend but with Cody I've asked him and I it's nothing I would ever hold against somebody no. I'm not at all unless if your number is outrageous then that's a little questionable but it's definitely something that just is like I'm just curious like it's not that I'm an insecure person. It's just that I just want to know want to hear how naive I am. This is how it this is how bad well this was also a few years ago. I was still in college my old roommate Grace her and I were like in my bedroom and we were talking one day and she goes what's your number and I literally was like nine seven eight eight five three, and I don't know that's not even mine or telephone number. Yeah, and I started saying My telephone number and she was like no. No, she was like you idiot like your body count and I was like, oh I was like, I don't know. I've never thought of it. I don't know why I don't think of it all that much and I think that's probably just because it's not something that's like a game-changer in any of my relationships because I've never really been with someone who's like slept with hundreds of people saying yeah, but that's that and if someone but I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be interested. I would not be interested. Yeah like I'd be like, okay. Well, obviously If it's if it's over, I'm not going to say like what my number is or like what not my number but what like my ideal number and a partner is but if it's over a certain amount then gotta go because like that's sorry. Yeah. I'm like flexible about stuff like that. Like I know that a lot of people our age like sleep around and experiment and do not like different things. Yeah. So that's never bothered me. We have one question or not. Really a question. It's actually a story from one of our girlfriends. And shoot I was looking through. Okay. Here's Tiffany's. Well, that's not even her real name. So I guess it's fine. Oh God is a lot of Tiffany's there's a lot of Tiffany's in this world. Okay, so shout out to this bitch.	
2	Here's her story.	
1	Okay, it's the second one. So I was on a date and fell so hard that I was gushing and tore my knee open. We went back to his apartment and cleaned it up and ended up having bomb-ass sex when Queen yes Queen when we turn the light on there was blood everywhere from my embarrassing, right it gets better. I ended up not talking to him much, but I matched with the guy. On tin with his weight sorry much but I matched with this guy on Tinder and turns out it was his roommate and he heard all the sex we had LMAO I oh I have more element feyo. This is a short story. I throw up on a dick once that's a story.	
2	Okay? Okay. So this girl is obviously seen some shit.	
1	But I mean, that's there it is a funniest fucking Three I've ever heard when I think of like sex stories. None of that's ever happened to me. No, like that is some like what the fuck happened that night like you're gushing at the knee. I had some what the fuck happened and I wake up and I'm like, oh that was kind of psychotic but like yeah, nothing to the point where I also don't I don't have you ever used Tinder or like any of those apps know I like started dating Cody when that became cool. I've never like an iguana literally never had one. I think when I Freshman College. I made a tender and then like some man he messaged me and of course I'll got it was just so weird and I literally don't think I ever answered. I started dating someone and like never responded and just deleted it. So now I just don't have a tender. Can I also just say I like I'm not against like Tinder and people who online date but personally if I was ever single, I just don't think that's how I would want to meet someone. Yeah hit the bars hit the bars or the dog park. Yeah, you know Not that I've seen any Daddy's at the dog park, but but that's a natural way to need someone. Yeah, and I also think no Enjoy. Maybe the bar isn't always the best option. Yeah do something like a hobby that you enjoy. Yeah. Maybe it's someone's work out. I put see any time about the oh God meeting people know Jenna's where no, I think if you have a dog and you're single go to the dog park go to all the darts on Daddy's there. Yeah for sure. And usually a little off but whatevs. No, I definitely and I can I can say this like I have a boyfriend but there's definitely some handsome young men at the dog park. Oh, yeah sure and I'm sure a lot of them are single looking for a lady and they have don't hit it up who doesn't love a man with the dog half. The reason all my got happier. Okay. I'll say like point three percent of the reason. I love my boyfriend so much is because he's Golden Retriever and I are essentially a relationship. Yeah Cody has little I don't use my man. Dog, but but but it's a different. It's a place like if he had no animals like I don't know only love you a little bit less but not too too much. Oh, yeah, we had this we had this other girl who she wanted to her who this person is. Yeah. We don't know her name. She did like message. Oh, yeah, so she's just trying to she wants to shout out her her ex boyfriend who cheated on her. We don't know who she is, but gee. She's but we appreciate your content. Yeah, we do like a bear up in Lovin her ex-boyfriend had to dress up as a Playboy bunny and go to Hooters and we're all these different things like and she basically said so my cheating in all caps ex-boyfriend lost a super embarrassing bad for Halloween and someone was kind enough to bless me with all these pics. She sent some pretty amazing photos. I mean obviously seeing a man in a tight pink ones. He's always Amazing and then she just said gotta put that baby carrot on blast. So there it is. She's on blast. She won't let us follow her but I truly hope that we pay for her. Yeah, and we wish her the best she jumped the reason I like the reason we were saying this right now is because she just messaged me and it just said cheating loser of the week. Okay what I'm not really sure about these like dicks drawings. Yeah, I don't think that hitting us. Yeah, I mean like they're they're like they're funny. I don't know how old she is. Maybe we can chat later with her. Yeah, if she yeah, she said she wanted to stay private. I don't know. So maybe she's just not even a real person but it's fine fans supporters supporters. Always we love that not appreciate you. Can we do? All right guys? Well, this is getting a little lengthy. It's so lengthy. I hope you guys listen to this whole thing.
