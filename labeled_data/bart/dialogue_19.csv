2	You're listening to the man from this podcast episode number 15.	
4	so I'm going to do a podcast today, and I want to talk about the mind, you know, because I think it's such an important thing to discuss because and I think we don't talk about it enough and so many of us get caught up in our everyday world doing the everyday same thing day after day week after week year after year, and I think we never really take that time to it and reflect or contemplate about our Behavior about our results about the way we're being in the world and you know that the mind is his beautiful machine it allows us to do so much and it allows us to problem solve in a way like, you know, no other species on this planet, but it can also be a death trap and I use those words specifically because being trapped in the mind literally can kill you, you know, and I think It's killing a lot of people and I think it's killing a lot of men and I think it's why one of the reasons why anyways suicide is such a prevalent in male around the world like this is epidemic levels. And I think you can't have a discussion about men and mental health and all the surrounding subject without discussing the constructs of the mind because I think once we start to understand how it works and why it works the way that it does. I think we're going to have a lot more informed conversation about the best strategies or ways or techniques that we can help ourselves get out of it because there's only so much other people can do. You know there's only so much family and friends can do to help us. There's only so much things that governments and institutions can do to help us. I think what this really takes is some personal responsibility to really learn about yourself and learn how you work and why you are the Way You Are And you know, I'm listening to this beautiful Guru said Guru so, you know, I'm a big fan of following different ways of thinking and you know, different mentors and spiritual teachers. I'm a very spiritual person and I kind of loved their philosophy or their truth that they bring and you know, obviously I'm a very big fan of meditation and I moved to meditation for this very reason I felt I felt locked up in my own mind. I felt anxious or I felt depressed and you know often I wouldn't know why I was feeling these ways, you know, and it would it would just drive me insane and and then I guess I would then go off and try to do something to get myself out of this state and you know that often led to being, you know, looking for alcohol or drugs or going out and partying or sex or or getting into fights, you know, like some sort of release valve. And you know what? I started to realize through meditation is that I was using the same mechanism that got me into trouble to start with the mind to help myself get out of it, which was the mind again. I'm using the mind to help myself get out of my mind and that statement alone sounds insane. Like why would I use the same thing? You know, I've heard it been compared to computer programs like, you know, once there's a virus on your system. You don't use a virus to get to get rid of the virus use an anti-virus. Use the opposite here. And so what's the opposite of thinking or what's the opposite of the mind will its Stillness? And it's the body and its feelings and emotions and sort of stepping into that realm. So, you know, I want to discuss this this idea of our minds and and I think men we really default to thinking a lot of the time and I think it's the reason why we can't you know sends our emotions well enough we tend to always be logical and be strategic and you know, there's nothing wrong with that. I think that's that's great. It's a great key characteristics, but it from what I'm seeing with a lot of men and I've known this with myself. It's the area we get stuck in because we only see the world through that lens. Everything has to be, you know, measurable and logical and rational and understandable and all the all the doubles. So to speak, you know.	
3	And that's really only one part of the story only really one part of the story and so many times in my life. I would often get lost and confused or take different directions in life and find myself and maybe a particular place. I didn't want to be and then I would obviously default, you know, go to the mind to get myself out of it will go to the strategy or try to analyze why I got myself into this position and you know the other side of that He's really this intuitive emotive feeling sense of us which we tend to often turn off. and what I'm what I'm really want you to encourage to do is to take a moment to really try and find that place again men need to really find how to get themselves out of their minds because we operate way too much from there and it really clouds our world and meditation has been a beautiful way out for me to be honest and as mentioned inside Guru he had this really beautiful analogy that I have to share with you and he He described the Mind as a really really sharp knife a really really big knife and he talked about how if you don't have a steady hand with that knife. You're all going to end up cutting yourself or cutting other people and that's very much how our minds work even how I words work, you know, when we say things to ourselves. We could we hurt ourselves. We often have this negative chatter and often we blurt that out on the ones that we love as well. So we negatively affecting your saying negative. With negative things to the ones that we love so we heard other people I comes from the mind. And so this is another analogy of the Steady Hand is kind of like having this sort of steady mind and when we do have a steady hand and we have a steady mind and we make that cut, you know, the knife becomes useful it allows us to cut things up and to be utilized for what it's for. But if it's if we're untrained we have that shaky hand, then we often make a mess of things and so I	
4	These everyday myself in the men that I work with my mate with my friends that you know, this is inability to study themselves to steady their mind and then they get locked up in this Loop and often have to Loop of you know, Despair and depression and then you get so far down that rabbit hole.	
3	You really don't know how to get yourself out of it. And you know, I've been really reflecting on my life and looking at the decisions that I've made and you know how my life has unfolded up until this point and I have to be honest with you looking back now everything that happened to me no matter good or bad has really created the person that's talking to you. Now, you know, I'm a product of those things. So even though things did get bad a - I felt like I was off path. It actually was the Catalyst that helped me get to know myself better. It actually was the Catalyst to find the right path will get back on the right path. You know what I mean? So when I look back on it those things that I thought were terrible at the time, we're actually the best things for me or actually we're also trying to help me out. and so when I look back, you know, I've won a hundred percent of the time if that makes sense, you know things have worked out for me 100% of the time is when I look back but when I'm in the moment	
4	I'm so fearful of things going wrong. Does that make sense? Like I'm so fearful of the worst case scenario. I'm so fearful of losing all my money or never finding that relationship or you know, you know all the worst-case scenarios that this mind kind of interject in there and you have to realize that this brain is 2 billion years old and it's number one goal is your survival keeping you safe. So it does this to us it sends out these Visualizations these predictions of a bleak future because it wants us to be safe it wants to for us to be small, but honestly, that's not our nature. That's not how we were billed. That's not actually what we want. We want growth. We want Ascension. We want to be the better versions of ourselves, but taking steps towards that comes with a little bit of fear and resistance and stepping into the unknown. And so when I'm in that moment, yeah, I'm feeling the fears. I'm feeling the The feels I'm feeling all the anxiety about it. But if I can overcome my mind and steady my hand, I know that taking a step forward in that direction in the direction that I want to go is the best way forward and now looking back at my life and seeing where I do, you know those moments where I really felt lost or in the unknown those were the best moments and I've always one like I've always come out on top, you know, if I lost the money I found the money we came back somewhere else if I lost a client I found a better. And if I went through a heartbreak there wasn't I found an even better relationship if I'm a better person to spend my life with you know, if I got kicked out of this house.	
3	It was a better house waiting for us. So like every time I was I thought I was in a negative there was a better opportunity waiting for me and if that bad thing didn't happen, then I would never have got an opportunity to experience that new level or experience that new opportunity. So I say this to men specifically because I really feel like we get bogged down here and we stop our growth and we stop our elevation and we stop becoming the men we came here to be because we get so caught up in the in the mind and the rules and the regulations that we put into our heads about how we should be and who we should have been by now and how much money we should have earned and how many houses and how where we should be on the corporate ladder and all this kind of Bullshit that we kind of put on ourselves and then we mastered up going. Yeah, but I do it for my family and I do it for my because I'm a provider and I my job is to look after my family that's bullshit. You know, there really is full of shit because you didn't come here just to be a provider and I done a mini podcast about this topic. You came to be so much more than that and look back at your life and see that everything that has happened to you as happened to you for a reason and I truly truly believe that and the only reason that you wouldn't think that is because you're lost in your mind and you're using your head to analyze what's happened to you thus far that's the only reason you're stuck and the only way out is to shut that mind off. Get into your body and really reflect on the big picture and the person that you have become because of what you have been through.	
2	It has literally changed my life and change the way that I live my life because now every time I come up against something that I think is difficult or challenging. I'm almost excited about it now because I know that this is going to be a potential for growth. This is for me to step into a new level of me. And yeah, it's fucking scary. I'm not saying here that this is all easy.	
3	Even for me I get my moments and I	
2	Days where I'm uncertain of myself for I'm sure I'm sure I read this I repeat, you know the same dumb patterns over again like so many times like man.	
3	I know this shit, why do I keep doing it? But you know, that's that's part of that process that's part of learning and growing is sometimes going back to the start again and doing all the things that you thought you completed and starting back from the start.	
2	You know, so I hope that was beneficial to you. I really wanted to get that out because I really felt strongly about having that explained because it was so clear to me and you know, I spent this afternoon really looking back at my life and looking at all the things that I've gone through and you can really turn your trauma into Triumph, you know, and you can really turn these experiences that you think will be the end of you or destroy you and you can really be the Phoenix that Rises From the Ashes like that. The story for all of us. We just have to work out where along the line you are. You know, where along the line you are. So have an amazing amazing day have a wonderful week take a moment this weekend or wherever you are in the world and reflect on your life and see if you can connect the dots. See if you can see all the things that have lined up that have set you up or the people that you've met because of the things that happen to you and you know, really be grateful for it really really be grateful for it. Then once you start doing that, you're going to start noticing the dots as you start looking forward and that's cool shit. When you start to see the dots lining up as you look forward.
