1	Hey, hey guys, welcome back to lost kids in Walmart podcast. And today joining me. I have Bianca. Hello. I also have a knee. Hello epic Gamers, and that's it because someone else didn't want to join this. So how's everyone's day today? All food. I have to be pretty Epic. I mean relatable, honestly. I think that Bianca wanted to point something out about Delphine did I oh, yeah, she has bathwater. You guys probably know that I want it. Why why do you want it because it is it is a sacred treasure, but no it isn't a gamer girl. It is not an Instagram. That's thought start.	
3	No gave me a girl bath water.	
1	That is this is her since like it right it's strange and you're strange and I don't like you that's not a very nice thing to say. Yeah, Bianca cheese.	
3	It's not very nice. I saw something on Instagram about like 53 people reported to have herpes. After drinking for bath Waters.	
1	Well good. It's great. It's their fault for buying the bath water. Look your town. I mean, yeah, I also saw something about Misfits bong water for all you thirsty gamer boys.	
3	I asked my mom if I could buy that and she said no that's too bad said it is so I want I want their bong water.	
1	It's better than fucking hell doping at water. Now it's the only outcome is herpes from chugging her bathwater. I do it.	
3	Oh my God, what if I poured her bath water into my back water and then throw it's like they are given bail, Delphine, um like this.	
1	No, he's not they even build. Oh I wanted to don't look for me Bela Lugosi. Don't bathe her.	
3	Please don't in her.	
1	I mean, I mean she's my wife. So I remember I owe it to her. I hate you. I hope you know that.	
3	I know I know.	
1	Do you guys know who Danny coda's?	
3	I don't know.	
1	I'm cultured slime. She's like she's like this girl. I think she said she was like, oh she's a girl who who said she was pregnant give it attention or whatever. Yeah that one and she's like 12 or 1 and whatever what she like pranked her parents.	
3	She everyone thought she was totally like she's telling the truth and then out of nowhere. She was like, oh Oh my God, I just pranked you guys so much.	
1	Why would you do that? I don't know ask her and apparently she's like 12 or 13 and she's dating the 17 or 16 year old person.	
3	Oh, yeah and like an elaborate his name is do you think the Bad Dudes named Mikey? Oh is he was she was like another guy or something?	
1	I don't know. I don't keep up with her. I just know that something happened to Mikey with his parents or something and he's trying to get emancipated.	
3	Oh, oh, oh. Oh, okay. Oh.	
1	Oh, I think it's because they disapproved of his relationship with Danny because like, you know, she's 13 and he's 17.	
3	So like yeah, I can see how he should be like I don't like her.	
1	Actually, I don't I don't think anybody likes her like her you do not have a good mindset and you are probably a pedophile.	
3	We're a little either little file that makes sense. I want. I feel like my love for lalli's makes me a pedophile.	
1	Well, even though I'm still a minor. Yeah. Well like Well, you're different because you're different and over and I'm like, yeah.	
3	I mean makes sense. I recently started this thing where since Bell Delphine pulled off that the bar. Oh, oh, oh, oh technical difficulties.	
1	Oh, do we have to do this over again?	
3	No, okay, because I can cut Parts out. Okay. I can trim parts out. I can also add in music and I can	
1	Oh, yeah, so what else you can talk about?	
3	Okay, what happened?	
1	Okay, tell your mom that she's a homosexual. Anyways, as I was saying the other day, so it made me think about since Philadelphia and pulled off that PornHub thing and then as now selling bathwater the next thing she should do is make a movie. What would it be about?	
3	I don't know.	
1	I don't know fucking like remember that one movie. I want to make she should do that where those Eagles defeat that guy who try to shit. Fuck shut down to the top. I can't speak.	
3	He should do this.	
1	Okay, that's a good idea except for being Tick-Tock. It should be Instagram. That would be epic. Yeah. She should do that.	
3	We should do that.	
1	I'll be sure to pay her. What is it? $3,000 on our patreon shut so I should oh, yeah, like and tell her that do it. I can I would pay $3,000 for a bell delphian movie If I told my dad or my mom that I wanted to pay bail Delphine $3,000. I think they'd kick me out of the house. I know who she is. That's nice. It is. It's not nice. I'm very concerned for my father. Wasn't he watching like some furry anime and like I went onto his Reddit account and like he posts so much shit about that fucking anime. What anime was it? It's a it was sent goes on. I forgot the entire name, but like I watched one episode and it's okay, but like not something to be obsessed over. Is I think it in English is translated to The Helpful boxset.	
3	Senko Sanic.	
1	Yes that one. Yep. I think we will that's why oh gosh.	
3	It isn't it is in fact a furry animal does. I knew someone who classified bunny girl Senpai has a furry anime the fuck.	
1	It's not there's only one up and she's a funny girl. What the hell good and you should it's good. Yes, do it the authors also complaining about how bad it was going to be and she's like, I'm finally watching it. No, that was a That was fuck. What's it called? Eromanga Sensei now Polly is great. I watch like one episode and then I stopped.	
3	I think it's good.	
1	But those about incest that's cause you're weird and I hate you. I mean same what is I hate myself too? I know.	
3	Oh. Oh God. Okay, so this other night I thought I thought I was awake like I thought I had like a dream and I thought I was awake. I for real thought it was awake and that happens a lot. Like my parents will talk to me and I'll think that's it. Like them talking to me is a dream but it's not but it's time it was the other way around.	
1	I was having a dream. But it was real real life. And for some reason my mom ate me. Oh that was it like this elaborate thing about how my mom ate me that's great woke up and did my daily morning routine. All right, and then I go up for breakfast and she's like all right time for breakfast and then she eats me. That's great. I'm sure that means you have a boar Kink it probably starts. Oh dear God. I have a similar story to tell. Oh no. Oh boy. Okay, so I had this dream like like a couple of years ago where apparently my cousin fell out of the car and had to go to the hospital thinking about that and I totally forgot. It was a dream. I thought it actually happened. So I was like, hey Mom you remember that one time Gracie fell out of a car went to the hospital and she was like no. What are you talking?	
3	How did she fall out of the cars though?	
1	I don't know. I think like I just remember my parents walked up to me and they're like, hey your cousin Gracie open the car door and fell out of the car. Are we trying somewhere and now she's in the hospital and I was like, oh that's kind of stupid and my day. How old is she she's at the time? I think she was like 10.	
3	I was 11 and he opened the car door.	
1	Yeah, but like in the fell out of the car. Yeah it with the seat belt long, but it was a dream like remember it like it actually happened. It smells like what the fuck.	
3	Are you okay?	
1	I'm not okay.	
3	If I did that to my mom, like I asked her if lie like that was if that happened like as it happened, then she'd probably think I was hallucinating and take me to the hospital. So I'm surprised your parents didn't it?	
1	Yeah, my mom was like maybe you should ask your grandma cause I'm pretty sure to she'd remember something like that. So I asked her if she was like no here Korean law. Yeah. I know what are you talking about? I was like are you fucking kidding me? I will I will kill her and her parents another another technical difficulty.
