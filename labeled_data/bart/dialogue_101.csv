1	Hello and welcome back to the talk unit walls podcast. We're here for podcast number 12, and we are here to review obviously the games that happen in November alongside. Cheers time talking to the my queen. Hey, I'm checking on fine. I'm fine could barely a levels. Are we going to be reviewing the games from November? And of course we could actually be talking about a team of the decade as well. But as always, my name is Dave a long. So I've been here is Tom y'all got the black Tom? How's it going?	
3	Great. Thanks.	
1	Good make good. I like your hat.	
3	Cheers mate brush it rocking the Daniel Powter.	
1	Obviously. We have got MacKeeper Matt dying and the callings just about and our special guest today is none other than mr. Harry Mansell.	
3	Hello Mary. Thanks. Thanks.	
1	Which one is it?	
3	We've got some sound effects like Steve Wright in the afternoon. Thank you very much.	
1	So, how are you? Of course, you've come I think we felt sorry for you in the last there's always water. Okay. There we go. In the last podcast. We took I'm pretty sure we took the McHale.	
3	Yeah, I didn't mind it was funny.	
1	It was a shit show that it was I on I ain't joking.	
3	I generally thought you were really good and then when I put it on foot picture on Twitter, absolutely. Yeah, I'm or Fashions terrible. But when I will stop there in a while it wasn't that bad.	
1	Maybe it was just it was just horrendous. Yeah, it was right. We are going to be kicking off with well actually the Bratislava game, but the home time Wolves of course ended up winning that game one goal to nil to rely on a stoppage time winner from him and as I mean, it was pure domination, but it was one of those games Thomas. You can remember it werewolves just couldn't seem to break through. Yeah, they go keep ready pretty good games.	
3	But yeah, you made a good saves and we played quite well throughout the game, but it just took a lot of patience to build to break them down. And then because that horrific injury that took 10 minutes out of the game gave us the extra time to go to get the goal that we needed but ironically	
1	- Cody as well.	
3	Yeah, but but he put his hands together. So, you know, yeah, it makes it all better specs but I got to be honest.	
1	It's that long ago Dave and I was just my fault.	
3	It's your podcast me.	
1	Anyway. All right, Matt. Do you remember the game all yeah, it was it was it was really frustrating in I think it was one of those those games that we've seen previously where we did. I think we would have played or not and not scored or just never look like leave. Again, it came in the 92nd 93rd minute. Yeah, 12 minutes and I'm very very very light is the Fantastic header. What a late that was the other similar chance today against Sheffield United worries a lot of standing jump or not jump Center off. It's a great leap. And yeah, it was good obviously very important to get the three points now that now that we've qualified so that's all that really matters isn't it rather than the performance the trailer I put the ball in for?	
3	Yeah, it might ease Souls water wet.	
1	He's awesome. And he's a real ability though. If it is something that he's really showing off a little bit more this year some of the haters and he's got a couple of them this year. We very rarely get what balls into the box I deliver.	
3	Yeah, Troy puts a line any try. All right.	
1	He's already and Border. Yeah, there was of those a point today where we've got two players overlapping on the wing and I looked in the box and there's approximately zero players and their strict him just comes out a lot and yeah, very rarely. Give me exact.	
3	Getting the cross yesterday and we'll move on from that game all unless are you going to have just been really boring but atmosphere and yeah, I read kicked him in the are 12 and it's added on and we got the goal. Drink should have listened enough for that night's an accident. I think it's did it was unlucky to get a yellow card for it. And he said yeah. Hey it's dangerous, but it's all read them. Yeah, like you say their keeper was good. And I thought they just played at their skin, which is a big game for them with coming tomorrow their fans. We have mentioned their fans. They were amazing. Yeah. Yeah, everybody said they were genuinely the best fans. I think I've ever seen him on you.	
1	Please probably about 500 upstairs and downstairs and all these, you know, the reputation of racist chant in and just been Ultras and stuff like that and have come out with these chance and then they followed with yeah.	
3	I was thinking that needs to be that needs to be introducing. I absolutely loved it.	
1	It was great.	
3	Let's load that stuff into the kind of yeah, I'll obviously thought that was full of kids. They're not mad at the sphere.	
1	I thought that Phantom earlier Tom with a couple weeks go up against Aston Villa 2-1 win. Obviously Reuben Eva's score in the opener him and his more. Let's put in the game to bed before trezeguet got that consolation goal Matt. It was a massive one wasn't it though? That's first off performance. Probably the best I've seen as right ever. Yeah.	
3	It was since the last time we played ever. Hope. That's the that's the maybe man united in the cup holders in there that holds the plastic plastic.	
1	But yeah. Was great. It was doc said probably the best I've seen apply especially especially under Noona if we just take our chances are many times. I need to keep saying and that game would have been out of sight and in the second half we wouldn't have happened. Well, it obviously would have happened but you know, we put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that second half a lot of unneeded pressure. Is that deeper and deeper which have been conscious of in the past few seasons. Anyway, I Watford New Year if I could Braga. Yeah, so it yeah, the first off was great should have put the going to bed, but it's one of those Delivered when it was terrible probably the worst team us. I've seen this either. I'm not just saying that because of the villa and there are local Royal.	
3	I was really disappointed by John begin because I thought was going to be a property. But yeah, he did turn exactly battle between McKinnon and routine you but yeah, yeah. Well when they show you one just didn't tell the story did it we could have beat him up five one on the day really and five shots on target is Philip. I think Villa did Miss grealish, but they were so bad. I mean they do today. I looked at that I thought yeah, they're getting relegated in. It's the best of sin tree or a human hairs and jata combined. I thought they're absolutely lethal and obviously Doherty and Johnny and they're like we say like you got to be scoring up the score more the chance and yeah, that's it had to a good was there never is his goal. I thought it's been really clever at the time I said because I said to my dad this is going to be s a very respectable to come in this coming out to neighbors and it happened and I was thought I was the best thing ever to put that on there and then people said, let's do it on the radio and they're going Everyone in the ground could see what then is you can do but I did leave any words. I mean never sees my very much all the boxes left him on his own very naively little run up the knee little shimmy Runner. Here we go. Great finish. It's almost like and today there's a couple of times. It's like watching rugby where you wait for the man in the pocket for a drop goal the end of the game where we none of you know, but I might there will be one person watching. Who knows. Thanks, Dad.	
1	Well, I was going to ask if I mean the back free I think that was one of the first times really we saw Cody then Duncan say sort of look pretty pretty solid. I know we've had previous games. We've spoke about it the Arsenal game and so on but forward touch on it now before we move on to the next game, how do you lot think that I know they didn't play that back for you today? But how do you lot think we've adjusted? Life without Willie Bali as well because I personally think it's doing a lot better than what I am.	
3	Anyway, I think that Danka he's pretty much saved us about doesn't he like they slide in has been unreal. I was really worried and we know we can play there. But yeah, I'm real seis on the left. I think when Polly comes back I don't be harsh and then dunker I would just slap body back and on the right. So he's remembering its besiktas away using real that game. So you have to fair play to Dent Anka. I mean like I say he saved us because I was really worried when body got injured, but the way he slaughtered in has been incredible. I think I'll come over for said it last time but but I think we look better going forward with those to the back because they bring the ball in to Midfield don't like a bit more fluid than previously we retain possession a lot better as well so far.	
1	I'm not going to sing a lot Bennett but a lot of the time it is you never did. No you are right, but those two are and Cody the Freer and natural with the ball at the fit. They're all they're all midfielders. So it's natural that we are going to retain possession better under distribution is going to be better. I mean the out ball is a lot better, especially Block then Duncan part of his leftovers, right? So yeah, I think we've adjusted seamlessly tight body's not even not even gone but even got he's got to come back straight to the team.	
3	They asked yeah, especially that best defender model only. I'm real even kill many think is just a really well. Yeah definitely has already promised big pressure on him as well and they're coming into that. I could have gone but you don't feel like we're going on the ball. Whereas if I lay eyes on the ball, I'm twitching like get it off him and he just passed it out money for a phone seems like that that bothering them.	
1	Yeah, that might be cut short in. Everybody's hands as well. But yeah, I think we've killed mean obviously with him being that Futsal player. They're going to be quite good on the ball and so on. I think you look really comfortable especially today is Sheffield United even with the aerial Jules. I didn't do too badly will give you books up a little bit which will happen. Naturally. It could be a really good player because positioning and that he's got the they've got the football brain. You can say that it's just physically he's it isn't found a little bit wanting still but he's a big boy, and he thought I said I put a bit of size and I'm like the dummy of the pies are never as you look at pictures from when they saw into. Yeah, probably Officer I don't even in size.	
3	So if they did that we killman, but the we did that would cost her and then he turned out to be his first awful easiest and in these amazing on the other hand as well like they're itchy, but Doherty's gone from being like overweight and then being like athlete who is spoilers for brewing a bad word. Sorry Danny if you listening	
1	Probably should have been a lot more than what the score lines suggested to one win in the end. Material on him in is getting the first half goals second half goal for Bournemouth Steve Cook and a red card in the first half as well for France's pure. From wolves Tom it should have been more though.	
3	Yeah, well as much alluded to earlier on with giving the goals away too easily. We're not killing games off and that's why we against against Braga and the next game should have been out of sight really but I was actually here when that game was going on and then drove back listen to on the radio and I just said it just makes the come back for the form of even more amazing when they inevitably come back in two days. You didn't know that there was one that was going to give it away at some point we Play well for 90. It was very similar to The Villa guy absolutely battered of their staff from one of our best performances with Villa and then they get a man set off as well. So I'm thinking what is going to absolutely annihilate him second half but they seem to up their game with yeah - we just I don't know what happened. But that goal from a teeny. Oh, you think it was across that? Yeah, I think mentees you think I think he meant. Well you did it again today. Maybe it's going to become his thing is that he can score from these ridiculous tight angles, but he just sits right?	
1	Yeah. That was that was definitely a shot. Shaq deal anyway if that was a cross it's an awful cross piece. It's loaded. Absolutely everyone look at the height on it and how he dips. It's not that's not cross. Its. I mean it don't matter.	
3	What is it that an audacious so good. I thought you meant it because it's probably one of them things.	
1	I'll just Whack It In The Box and if I don't hello, I'm home Mom Walk In The Box and hopefully someone gets a touch on it. Yeah, that's what I think. It's a shot. He's far too clever to just whack it racquetball across the area.	
3	I don't know if a player like that shoot it from that angle. It does. I can't see why you would try to score from there.	
1	That's why I think that's why I think it's official the video of him taking free kicks in training not from that angle.	
3	This part is quite small pitch anymore.	
1	Yeah, he's quality and I mean he's taking a lot of the set pieces now head of Never As I think his I mean even that one in Sevilla, and we're never scored I think That was now it seems to only be taking them if it's like director for your goal. So you see he could get the dip on the shots really well, but matino seems seems to be the man. Now you have a goal as well obviously was him in his goal. Yeah material again with a set-piece a Dharma will across him heroin.	
3	It makes me better at loving money fast. Yeah another great question and the way you opened up his body him and asked us to tapping of your left foot and he's on fire any at the moment scoring all those schools, but he's got a The the balls coming in.	
1	Yeah and trial rights get that first time. He's like to go from standing to false full pelt in a couple of seconds. Yeah, it absolutely roasted. Harry Wilson.	
3	It's been a couple of goals like that that have just shown everything that's good about our attacking play within two or three seconds. And then we score a goal everything from that goal was perfect and showed bettina's class and think a quick-thinking tray. All right is showing that he's on the same page everybody else now and making that run and human has his His and product from compared to last year particularly good like I'm real and and if you notice all writing about 85% of the time we attacked on the right now because I think of some Jolly Joe or on the other white did that much today really was always going down the right way to take some imagery.	
1	We are we are productive player that we've got everything comes on that right? I'm sorry links it really well with Doc. Yeah, definitely sees come on Leaps and Bounds and it's it looks a different player. I'll speak to some of them. Actually they saying he carries on this form. He's Rich goal scoring and assists for how much is it going to be worth it and somebody said that 18 million pounds now for a play like that.	
3	It looks like an absolute bargain us. I think I think you can come and 30 million for him.	
1	Definitely 30 million. Counter-attack jotter on the left him initially the right Adama was the deepest man back. Why is you know, why is he I mean to be their defensive Duty wise I think you did. Okay today, like he was actually tracking back a little bit more. But again going forward today could he could have genuinely wants that game if you want.	
3	I guess he must be a nightmare to mark because the our easy it is from set to take along. It's so incredible sometime when the Villa game for the second goal loads of villa fans ringing up to W. I'm saying why didn't he tell Garcia's all one of their players say, whiny just take one? Just take him out body. Dim. Just get erect take a red card below then, you know things didn't they Ming's talking about for their freaking legendary? She's got all right moving on. Sorry. Did you go did you go to Braga boys move on. We don't mention jotters offside. That wasn't offside going as ball. Oh, yeah, like how the hell they are the block the boat flags for it straight away. If you keep slack down VAR check, it goes to college not Did you see John again Maddie you line him and some very similar thing happened today as well didn't it? But it was the referees for for blowing the whistle.	
1	Well, it's Simon who lines because it's not offside. Yeah. It's a referee's decision. You have to blow the whistle when the phase of play is stopped because you can carry on and school like he did not what that's not OV.	
3	I think he originally blue she fought him and as was offside when I originally went into him as they have a job what it was but he was on the line.	
1	Oh, so this city season only put you through I'll give you a hundred. Yeah, close hundred percent sure because if you see that flag go up and your Defender you think yeah Rana flags up, but that's still go through and that's why that that's the linesman's for want to blame the rest of that because you've got to trust you linesman fully you're not going to be very rare that you ignore the law. But that's what the protocol is. No don't don't blow the show. You shouldn't the blown he it's more the lines for Russian flag. He shouldn't flag because how's the ref going to know if you click it obvious in the ref, let's hit play on. He's got a truck driver makes a question with offside.	
3	You need linesman. It was let me I'll check it. Once your mean. Do you need more chips in the balls to put on the boots lines on the pitch lasers? That's what we want.	
1	Now. We are moving onto braggart on. I'm City girl a really good time. Thanks to one football preparing the PIP implants and crazy jealous to not just have a senior.	
3	What has happened to my YouTube channel like that comment somebody commented on one of the poems that I put on said what has happened to this chip? I think you're quite talented Tom talented.	
1	Which one they match today one. Did you he's very well spoken very eloquently put together.	
3	Is no way that somebody compared it to under milk wood by Dylan Thomas very clearly.	
1	You uncultured one of the greatest Welsh poems and I'll call ya video Braga to be there. We'll do it. So she bruised man.	
3	I'm sorry shows you Bruce police officers were beaten up in bra was like that cheering. Is it nah? Well if they would have we're documenting his job because he's been everywhere.	
1	Yeah anyway. Hey, everybody was good. For example football. Send us there. You know what it was great. When I think it was ridiculous that the weather, you know, it's like it go to Portugal be no set time here. It's November. All right now all day. Yeah, it'll be mild and it was it just I don't think we stepped outside and it was dry at any given point. So but apart from that lovely evening.	
3	Yeah, he's got the other way the worst tropical. Yeah.	
1	The worst thing was the day like the day after the Friday when we were flying back. Back, it was still the same weather in Porto. So everyone obviously again on the plane the couple of jackets big coat and then we flew to Lisbon before flying back to England and Lisbon was like 20 degrees. So you get out the flipping trivial I transfer you sweating will you like panicking when they pitch inspection that was happening?	
3	There wasn't a pictures.	
1	Yeah, which was terrible. We saw it and I thought like it was some some your dad that put it up and everyone was just getting smashed on super box. I'll go to here who's had one Supermarket told are going I searched pitch inspection on Twitter and it was just all these people tagging Spears and Joe Edwards asking in terms of pitch him inspection and said that they spoke to the locals about it and I just laughed it off so District, this is actually gonna be used to this at that time here.	
3	Anyway, so a lot better when there's a 6000 also probably won't Mobile's fans are then I ran out of holiday so I can go I was good. I do I was a bit worried, but everyone does seem to prioritize that my brother and I thought Brian I didn't really work.	
1	so star we've I wanted to I didn't really want to do right because I think I was looking at Bishop Tyson that obviously when one football game	
3	Relationship between Portugal yeah, he's been historically quite good wasn't there. I don't know if you want me to say this on a but they were never walls running but all the novels and on this. Yeah.	
1	Yeah apparently knocked him out. And if it's maybe it was stolen afterwards so cute.	
3	He's all right.	
1	Yeah. Well, I mean hearing what happened. I don't think he will be but nah, it's not good that but and we and we well, we've always said that touch wood so far.	
3	Everything has been going. Well, no trouble anywhere. And then this trip but as soon as you to start going line treatment, yeah, no children cheer.	
1	Yay, the Crusaders just waiting for the next round draw for us to get standard liège. Imagine around on Copenhagen soul back into the term expensive.	
3	I want I've Aroma or PSV not in the next round. You want not because of the team. I just want to go even them a bit later.	
1	Going to get to Roma no stab you like Gladiators in the Colosseum.	
3	Yeah, there is a far-right chanting.	
1	So should we talk about the game? What game? Oh, yes. Well, we probably 75% of the fans anyway and missed the first two goals because of the police so ensuring so we're in the queue and Emmas on One Note Down good evening. We're outside the grinding of the Braga fans or anything. We want.	
3	Yeah, we get towards it even has a scored and yeah Finn has missed it.	
1	So many things wrong so the game itself, obviously Braga took an early lead through a deflected goal through Andre jota jiminez, then equalized Doherty and adharma quickly made it 3-1 walls and the second half. We sort of collapse and it's paleo and Francis. Yo, I gotta go.	
3	He's in the start side four shots on target Regal that first goal of the bloke who shot his best mates Endeavors. And yeah, Man doesn't come off nervous to go in.	
1	Yeah, and then obviously they're him in his dhoti and Adama golfing The Pick of those for me is probably that Doty got in that that ball from the cross from Johnny Johnny always cuts in and use his left foot once great cross good editor good.	
3	Yeah another good hitter try all he's got his values you should have said It was wet like how you looked at that while she was saying but it was a good strike sword isn't bad.	
1	Yeah. I'll set you off Tom Ford want you calling it for one week Houston absolutely coast and another five or four more.	
3	I thought I knew that the bride will get back into it because I've seen this ID singles played before. I don't know what happened. You just wait awful a single doors. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just couldn't taking that but but to be 3-1 up in to give it away is very very disappointing.	
1	I think it Obviously took it away at to go ladies disappointed but I think because a point qualified US yeah don't think it really that didn't really take much away from it. People aren't I wasn't I was dozing that way they do that. So yeah, I think yeah, I got a good side though.	
3	I think we should offensively we were we were too cautious am on you isn't it was just after we lost to Chelsea and we were playing five three two, and is really negative.	
1	Should apply for the back.	
3	No, I think we should have you all three. That's that's seems to be working at the moment think that Chomp control damage to Citizen. Yeah, remember and then Bennett mess anything up in it.	
1	I'll now we will move on it to the game. We are recording in the currently on Sunday right after the game because Sheffield United's are going to be talking a little bit more about that. It disastrous start for going one-nil down lease say set score in the first minute goal and then Matt Doherty equalizing in the end in the second half. Half Harry would you recognize this game is strange when I think I don't think device I did enough to win the game.	
3	But it's yeah sloppy by both teams only really two teams in good form, obviously and Sheffield United the way they're set up to be fair to and was good. They were dirty the ref had a nightmare like give her out more bookings a shocking. Yeah, so but they sell really well and to go one-nil down of hard God. Here we go, but we grew into its second after we got we got better and better about and in the end we probably could have we could have won it but you think back to the mat chances though that Sheffield United out of what we look quite shake it the back.	
1	All four times the fries are great. They look good on the ball, but I actually think that that I don't actually think they have that many that many many chances in themselves. They lose.	
3	Okay going forward called Rick mccubbin even for your few times in the end.	
1	I don't just really 42nd. I'll be forced to yeah, I think I think Kris world has settled it for the drawer there. Anyway, I mean they were	
3	Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank. I'll be honest. I don't even know so first time because he always used to be	
1	He was a yeah.	
3	Yeah, Kenny jackett changed it.	
1	But yeah, I've just been very rare very yeah, he's very rare thing when you can't blame those teams picked used to kick rather than swap sighs, you know, so yeah, I think today was will struggle to live with Sheffield, you know is energy levels. They were they were every second ball. They will get it and perhaps they are the a little bit hungover from first the people say the professional athletes playing two games in a week. She'll be an excuse. It's not an excuse to you come up against professional athletes or implied. At all in the way. Yeah, so there is going to be he's a difference there. But I thought Jeff Ward United in terms of how they play with pretty poor. It was direct. He's running the channels. It was it was crap football, but it's so effective not the only game where you look alike. They goal kicks. They push everyone up they make the volcano literally all the players were probably 10 10 meter radius of each other because they know they're going to win that second ball and I can get more they so much the second door.	
3	Belgium son's voice we should go to match their energy level of charm Light trailer over and done the wing as well. He had a free blokes on him every time he did once I come on obviously got a few balls in but mad they remind me a lot of when Wigan first came up or when black ball first came up and they've got that on my God. I can't believe we're in the Premier League. Let's just run like mad all the time and they are getting tired in games. That's why they threw away a lead against man you died last week. They obviously got tired today throughout the last 20 minutes. They would really jaded and that's when we were getting better. Better and better and that's why we are you know, that's why we score so many late goals because we are so fit and we can keep on going experience and we display the same in the first minutes we do in the 90s when you think as well. I think you said about us like planning Europe. I results after playing in Europe already good. I don't think that's the way man see we've had a few of she draws in there, but I'm not thinking David McCall drink go.	
1	Me in football manager versus Ebola Burton Albion from liters of the Premier League and I like we did we did struggle so too much some for the their energy because I didn't they are at MacArthur would absolutely adore that exactly. Bipolar, if you'd brought this all on you probably want to do more than just her it could totally would've done more than him and there's no it's a bit concerning and I think they need to they will need to strengthen January and if new no does Stowe then we're no no studies.	
3	They will check by having a bite the other one. He's clapping every standard. I was January. I was reloading all know. I don't think you'll go now. I know you'd be mad too. I was worried at one point because like you say no smoke without fire. When his favorite. I'm thinking on God, but got it we've had we've edited that bit out. Yeah, a bit of interesting chapter.	
1	We could have gone to the bench today.	
3	I brought net1 or control anybody or leak under who is the young man what little white lady look under that leaky played them. Yeah, I'm sorry leak be generally genuinely against PSG and one of the one of the kids said after the And he said he looked like he could be in our class. Yeah, because he was he's tiny but he was decent player. Do you sent him it was okay when we play a game?	
1	So you all really excited about that Owen other Sally so against today's on the bed you do. He's an absolute decline. Yeah. He's a big audience a-wing backwards. Midfielder but dropped started using him as a Centre back.	
3	So it's all works to bit like playing. We haven't he's very mobile.	
1	Very White's contracts up at the end of the year though, and apparently all still living across from him.	
3	And as I'm real cross when it for though is after the celebration he left a bit under a cloud.	
1	It was rumors that he was already speaking with Stoke before What was its own demand? That was one of the reasons why let him go but every time we play Four Walls, he did really well and it's called lots of goals lots of important goals and to obviously hear that new style of so close. I love the phone you had a phobia on the back of one of my shirt the first line that's it 2015 beginning of 2015 that attack until Easter was the best attacking football. I just go if I miss a car man, I'm going to hold this field and choosing youth as well as the choosing on a Wednesday night and we had vampire. Terra di KO F OB soccer. Yeah, we just we just like crap defend. We talked about 71 our souls with the last time.	
3	Drumstick and off as well. He's gonna get sent off you give even my dad found in the early on when he lost the ball. They got had to play it down. So the first minute it's apply some games you look he just got out of bed and he's so like doping did anyone see that someone put on Twitter of like a like a lizard run across the desert. Yeah then danke when he has called to come on.	
1	Maybe she had a referee run as well proper locks all pail. Yeah. It was terrible today. Should I think it's David.	
3	Usually I'm the referees but he was awful today that they should have had George Bulldog should have been sent off. That's insane. That's what I thought. Yeah, he was stung. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah fair enough. That's fine.	
1	The first one you can check if the rest blowing the whistle.	
3	No, you didn't blows whistle blows whistle. So the first one annoyed me because nobody in the ground chapter 4 penalty nobody in the South Bank called for penalty. No player put their hand up for a penalty yet. We have to stop the game and look at a screen that says check in penalties ages as well. I didn't know we didn't know if it was for handball or a push on top. Dirty or whatever it was. It really really fast rights for straight smooth.	
1	ER it was good apparently check as well down the South Bank and John hoeven it yeah, we had a penalty kick as well. Do ya first time I'll definitely still we still haven't heard anything.	
3	Go for a sinner. Yeah, but which either means that the second after season we're going to get a low six points given to us season. The Nevers goalie is money not even true. They would have rolled that out, Oregon man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, right then we will now move on we were of quell quickly talk about the fixtures upcoming as well. So obviously another draw continuing the unbeaten run in the Premier League and now it's a pretty busy this Member schedule so walls are play West Ham midweek, right and next week. She kicked ass in our final Europa League group game and then going into a busy Christmas Pippi period Spurs Norwich City Liverpool and then Watford in New Year as well. So pretty hefty one Lads. I mean in terms of the next as I two games West Ham and brighten four to six points reveal.	
3	If you look at them in isolation, we should win both of those games, but it's Wolves and it's in a series of games and I think if we took four points would be pretty up.	
1	I think people have written West Ham off, but I have to make it really tough to watch especially against they were going to be full of confidence just have to waste time from last season turn up because out crap.	
3	Yeah, we turn them over didn't really bad. Um, yeah, that's right best performance. Yeah.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. I think I think West Ham's going to be a really tough game. They're going to be G deep after the after the Chelsea when it and brighten as well under under Harry Potter that they've really turned a corner.	
3	Corner, and I've given him what five or six-year deal screams around party went to that last year will be absolutely battered I've ever lost one. Now how we dance glimmery deflection?	
1	I think they both could be tough to see how much is a it's a tough place to go. So four points is really stick and I think reasonable. Yeah, definitely. I don't know. It doesn't matter how they come with us a pointer or three points away. But yeah, I'd say four points, but after that it's we could have range from anything to zero point mean if we don't if you don't lose one of them was that we're gonna be 11.	
3	Yeah, and when the parameter Right on over a lot of drawers in there, but it's some achievement. It's a quarter of the season. Nine games is a huge really hard to be. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, really sticking we always stay in games even when we're not playing particularly. Well if we're just one kneel down going into the last 20 minutes you feel like we've got a chance of getting at least a point. We got better and better don't music. Yeah.	
1	It's a bit strange though this season because we're having really good 45-minute performances. It's frustrating its orbit. It's not always the first or second half. Season where first off we terrible. Yeah II RP great and then not taking Chief what you're not into account the past four or five games the first ask Ben grass second a spinning back is short.	
3	So this one, you know, we said I think we mentioned last time that he's the whole thing that he keeps saying is that we can play well for spells, but we need to be able to play well for 90 minutes and we're not at that level yet. We're working towards its what yesterday and we're getting closer because it's not just a 45 minutes and then the second half there's a little crossover. A little you know about an hour or so we play well for now, but it's when we do play with and 90 minutes, I think will bloat.	
1	Anyway, I think it's getting there but we're slamming and Brian are going to be tough games and no gimmes by any stretch of imagination on Amazon Prime minute West up.	
3	I think so.	
1	Yeah Christmas games. Is it never whole is it Liverpool - see ya then?	
3	There's another One later in the season as well that they've announced they're going to take over Amazon.	
1	And if you hear something that I've got a clue about boxing, it's just numbers isn't it for ya. That's the same as in about another podcast. Yes. I am. I know you talked about new nowhere earlier. There was a report today that if you were to leave walls number one target would be Roberto Martinez for this one Chrissy will be more Sabri limb. Uchi from Nottingham Forest.	
3	Well Spurs are a bit of a project or name when he took them on you can go in any way. We don't worry about it. No, no stay. Oh, I don't put would have porch. I'm Geoff Emerick. You know, no good evening. So it was a bit cruel towards the end when it with the reports were saying that was good evening Moon. I if not as a good evening hours.	
1	That was ridiculous. That was he's such a loyal. Yeah, he's attempted to learn the language. You could probably say good evening in five different languages what I want to show you that it was it was very distasteful fresh soon slight managers when they don't try and speak English don't know sorry.	
3	Try it and then I do that it's like so obvious though.	
1	He still doing the interview with it. So yeah, so have a bit of decorum because he doesn't have to I can send someone else. So it's one of them. I'm sure I'm sure he's really dead proud of himself that journalists anyway, so she's Jeff. You should be able to run this one off and leave quickly got a question. It was off Andy hit kins. He of course a big follower the academy team but he says with a squad selection today is pretty obviously with the numbers on the bench. Is this show a lack of first-team squad depth	
3	Pretty obvious in yeah, that's the pin the that was the concern when it going into it small Squad, but new nighlok small squads and if we get any if you've got a few more injuries, not just Bali, we're really struggling at me. I think January maybe we also have this don't me you need to get defender of need to get them a stronger body. But Ruben Diaz has now gone 200 that takes some generous Bend is that their Portuguese clubs are ready to sell them.	
1	I just want me before Six or seven days absolutely Macedonian got as well, isn't it? That's what they'll go.	
3	They'll go for top top league players are young still we've got to assume what you said four layers going to go back and he's got to go back. He's got to go back home actually devastated about who's better Tom Cody lovely house that's a letter to a friend not to speak speak the comment sections in trouble now, so I'm really happy to come here comments. All this that's dog song is Right Enochs all this stuff about new no going to ask not and the fact that he didn't make any subs and that he's putting into 23 players on the bench could be right Jeff. I need some money desperately and the the story that came out just after the summer transfer window where it was wolves didn't know where they were going to be in the Europa League. So they were going to invest we know definitely going to be in a plane at least two more games and you would hope for maybe eight more games to get to at least the quarterfinals. So give me another two first-class.	
1	So if we get release another 60, if you go for that in my last night did that even the last fall and you actually get to the phone?	
3	You know the council went to watch it on my phone. There's no audio.	
1	Are you on and if you are an Android Android and Android users for the best video? If there was any positions at you free position while for any position or you guys I'm offering odds on Thompson. I thought yeah, I think we need a wee. Yeah, I agree the fact that we change our nation. Yeah, Pedro Neto is Young. You got potentially to Rory's not good enough. I don't think at the moment to be honest. Just coming straight on as how we call cavallaro back.	
3	Shantabai, it's not an obligation. That was it.	
1	Then we cover it with re calling because they've got an option on a character as well as well have my up front. So when I face Yugi can't record it now. He's he's not good enough to Warrant calling back. I disagree. I like that's one thing. I think we should call it your player buffing with the current stay at the school. Now, I would have him yeah long-term he for me.	
3	We'd have him for half a season and then I'd want to see someone but he could do both as medical plan the wing and he weren't too bad for you like the middle. If you do any when didn't either we just won we just won better cover the cut and cover that will challenge the first thing because all right ice like Cody off right sometimes but he's got nobody really who can challenge him for that position then Duncan maybe could Bennett has played there when Cody hasn't but I mean, he's not gonna pressure code. So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right. But yeah, even Eve said that the cleared yet. He said it got to the point where no Challenge and you just couldn't get motivated. He said he was playing Robert. She didn't care. She knew was always going to be honest.	
1	I think I think I tweeted a couple of weeks ago like we can have a player like I think it was relay home Betty. You can play two games in a row pie really poorly, but it doesn't matter because you'll still be in the team because no one else knocking on door behind you and I think Ben it stays at walls are numbered. I know he's had that injury and something this isn't made hounding him again before we get to the comments, but I genuinely do think that's like benioff in it.	
3	Not just not cozy that way of It Go,	
1	Doing well.	
3	So he's a something whereby when he got he got dropped out the blue than me. Something went right, right. Yeah the episode. Yeah, that's of course if you annoying very Douglas.	
1	Yeah Douglas attitudes terrible at parallel. But yeah, I do think I do think he's days are numbered the injury hasn't helped but if you look at the shame, he's been a good servant of the last night.	
3	He's overachieved for us like when we signed him.	
1	I mean on a free yeah. Well, we just we should be looking at better. I thought we got get one more point.	
3	They could get a decent fee for him as well and watch how old I was gonna say 5 million how much you should have had that on the soundboard how much let's see what the pink one is.	
1	I reckon that's how much you like. He is. Well, well, this is I think John will be gone in January as well. And in January 9 January, I reckon he wheels will job is Johnny's awful. Well Norris will come back and John Randall John Rudy.	
3	I can't believe in the road against Miller in the cop that first goal. Yeah. He said he had a locker and another second.	
1	He's my Vita wrists exam should come with mango chutney salad.	
3	I mean because they are fired just right, but that's a good moment for us. But the amount of mistakes he's made over the years like it's been crazy, but I don't be too harsh on him because if he met me for not me out. So yeah, he's Lovely isn't it?	
1	We're gonna move on to the main part the podcast although it's towards the end. Yeah, we do like you may have seen on one of our videos this week and you may have seen on our Twitter. We're doing it with a plot twist. However, someone did moan about Is to me on Twitter. So we doing it a team of the year was it? However, I can't remember stupid idea whose idea was it. However, you cannot select any players of the current team because it's going to be pretty obvious that the team would decade is going to be full of the current crop. So someone said was not the team of the decade than is it. Well, they're like and then I put the island from Hangar big if we've all the some we fade if we if anyone picks we have do it seemed to dick it decayed dedicated to it.	
3	Exactly. David was okay. Hurry all start over. You will do by a new weekly planner.	
1	Wait, this is team Harris team of the decade with no current walls playwright player.	
3	But what I will say is that you were these picked and on ability there but my love for him. Yeah, that's fine. So in golf colicky me, I'll be right back Kevin Foley when we got promoted this time of the you want. The it that was good. That's enough. Let's not lie in this decade 2009 not 2019 10 years. The deck is 2010 219 stinker. He was the best ride back in that time.	
1	Joking Foley was amazing.	
3	A lot of people did Pickens. I'll give ya Tommy you're not wrong, but he wasn't. It's strange to see what people think of decade is because they were picking like Matt Murray and people like someone had Kevin was scattered Steve more exact dude.	
1	So let's pause there Jody Craddock loads of people have said this he died 16 times in this decade.	
3	Okay another sure you're off to a good start here.	
1	I knew I knew you would but it because I said it I don't put it in the teaser is shoe home bathroom, then it's dead.	
3	But I'll let kradic is okay, because the second after that First Premier League season using men / remember nobody gonna Portsmouth with the bandage on her head laughter we're gonna season that stuff is purely should be goal weight Liverpool's Richard Stearman he served as well as a popular choice League won money Fear the Beard. Yeah left back my action plan when it was a 4-4-2 because that to squeeze some of these More like a for free fluid.	
1	Okay like that Christmas Tree by Douglas liftback Dart by right-wing Jarvis.	
3	Okay, not right wing a bit weird is I like deep Midfield. This is gonna be this is gonna be a controversial one. I just love this black. He worked hard right? I guess he's the captain of us were left. In shock. Oh, yeah, it's got to be so I had to squeeze this one in because I had to put him in there. So he's kind of locking the number ten roll tightly. I couldn't lie couldn't lie out this decade. He barely barely plays a plane but I you remember Harry you remember our forest of other product is what you barely played about your front also, like caustic having a kind of a famous style and academic Kevin MacDonald up front because he's my favorite ever walls player Ebanks Blake. Yeah. I thought about putting Ebanks like this best days with and the last piece of shit. Massive tour between tour turns three free players lecture and oil a phobia. In fact chart in know which one to pick problem with Doyle. He works hard work Robert my about so there we go.	
1	So I recommend we got McCarthy who loved that team that team would go down. Yeah. I like hard workers.	
3	A lot of hard work is if you work hard you your wish division go on Tom.	
1	Here's what were yours? Right? Let's see.	
3	It is genuinely some folks of talk. Some folks here boys. Akemi Hennessey. Akemi ago Douglas life back Sam rickets. Oh good you guys right back as a captain as well. Send to back sends. Yeah. Yeah. Now the next two is a very particular moment because they weren't very good for very long, but Courtney whores and Dominican oil into that 2015 ended 2415. When they first came into the team they were insane how good they were also these two boys and pepper in Greenland.	
1	Yeah, where am I - out clovers?	
3	Actually, you know, right she feeling yeah, I totally disagree that but Carol my Midfield 3K Mac. Yeah, Jack Price the Sherlock and what he's calling Sherlock and Moriarty not Moriarty the one day and he said oh what? This place is filled up there and it's it's Dave Edwards. Yeah. Oh you got a daybed was it he played the Whole Decade and no because you don't play Mazzy. I don't want to know because the front three of sacko car. Hasta Cavalier. Oh, no, it's like well, no because it's from this decade who's your Striker with a fluid where all is the changes? I just went for pay Steven Fletcher not like that. No, I didn't like Fletcher. Oh my God, and there was a video.	
1	Rocky since bully I'm since when I dropped the ball on that since Andy Gray, it's got a lot of episode and yes at the time the best rock we've had since puller.	
3	That's what I think that's fair of society, but he backed his bed and Fletcher never expects to win the crowd. He did. Yeah. Well really never played in the front just so we can't compare Fletcher technically was superb. I remember we signed Frank nubile awfully begin early shout for you have called and he used to always argue with someone with Frank.	
1	Clatter what was it called?	
3	But move on I can't remember but he's a funnier Keek Keek. Ya Sheikh. He was on that a lot him and another place. I print on banter on Baby Davis could be and steam. Anyway move out of the way when I come from Gone lap and go we've gotten Carly came up.	
1	Hey Full House. Yep, left back Barry Douglas. Yeah. So Center afsar Jody Craddock and Richard Stearman Jody Credit Company.	
3	Is there an echo in this room? Yeah.	
1	Go to a decade. It's just can't say right back. I've gone with Ronald Zuber.	
3	Well, I can shout right she'll be okay.	
1	Cheers my left wing on it going with this decade. So I do Marlo. I've seen people put him in there were steam rubbish.	
3	He's crazy, but they do not know you don't know how we played left wing of gone Jarvis.	
1	Yeah in the middle o is apply everything could probably still do a job for us now with Has Kevin McDonald for your class? He watched her brilliant. You think Kevin MacDonald could play in this County? Yeah, you do a job for us.	
3	If you brought him in I thought about Joe Allen recently.	
1	This one was hard for me. It was over. Goody Aura like all Carl Henry.	
3	What are y'all ready? All right guys, you mentioned and I'm really really nice toast.	
1	About 20 of those. Yeah, I like witty Aura. So I've already shot from everywhere. He's classes. So I picked call him right because I actually thought was very underrated. Yeah - yeah, and he was he was actually really good in the present. Not the crab. Yeah side to side then right wing just to featuring I've got I've got I've got sacko. Yeah, and then we swap them around your sucker for precise a CO these are apart from this current ERA. He's probably Since we left the premises definitely the best these are my he was amazing what to Centre forwards are Steven Fletcher and silver and events Blake good team. That's day up.	
3	Yeah, David kept him off. You've got him in there. Yeah. He's on the bench and he grew up in the goal of the night.	
1	So it's probably my team probably Echoes all of those really probably akemi goal. I mean Hennessey's are fresh out.	
3	Well, he's the most over at goalkeeper in the world for someone six foot seven. He gets beat from distance of very he cannot jumper you can get bleep reason. I'm gonna kick it. Because he's a goalkeeper.	
1	That's all probably all for that reason. I'll probably go tasuku Shack. Let's go shopping. You sure he's good. Yeah, he could just bury it but he didn't even catch a cold if you Perry's everything away before Peru. Yeah keeping goal. I go Sam Ricketts right back Mary Douglas. I think the cert for left back as well the center backs. I don't I'd probably go with Danny Bolen Stephen just because the league one thing I was gonna put bear ammonia.	
3	I nearly said bearers. Well, I think he declined very quickly. I think after the Premier League his Pace was Anonymous was he knows he was the fastest player in ask what they usually a hundred meters from he was faster than Jumbo's well, but you just quickly work quickly love the German suplex on a corner there.	
1	It's got be again Jarvis and sacko. I think McDonald as well. He was humble. Evil, it was animated Edwards. Yeah, we've got super David want us. I want to say and I'll get slayed. Oh God. Hey dudes, who else it like Jesus?	
3	Who else is in there for this for this decade? He's been the greatest servant for the club. Yeah to stick with us when he could have easily gone to another championship team in these Waters.	
1	10 goals in his last season for us some names of central midfielder who had since then that could even rival also barred by the Premier League Lee Evans and your lie ever told shovel Michael Jacobs who was involved in this exercise is only whole light to medium actually.	
3	Yeah, but then it doesn't make you so happy that what we've got now it does work and how quickly a job because it was just money wasn't it that we couldn't see Morgan as one man by himself if he would have had billions there were had all these records on Isn't it you didn't own all those players, but obviously we couldn't buy them and we got 10p Strikers.	
1	I'd probably Fletcher in a faux be so sad be back like laughing. Like Tom said I think you just did he did he did play?	
3	Well in that season we got relegate even had even not broken his leg against you can't really get into Doyle Doyle is the man we met for a career that talk about a career that declares. He Banks play key roles as he was 35 NOS Steve a little bit younger than that.	
1	And when he recovered he just jumps around all the nails. Oh, it was Telford. It looks a bit. I'd love to he loves the beers. Apparently.	
3	He just he just parties that season when we got promoted idly. I think I've been to quite a lot of the wagons onion every time I walk to the stadium was only back to back to school today. You just leave that darling.	
1	Did you hear about the coffee where he said he called him stood?	
3	Whenever a balloon here, we have mentioned either and he kills not a very good player. But inside is are you ready Freddy? Yeah previously in existence. That's the game.	
1	That's the real quiz at the at the at the molyneux sleep at is the other thing that's wrong is it allowed to run wolf where they were there? They play indoor thought we would call Henry and no one said RE/MAX break. Who's Carl Henry's there was all this a Eubanks baby comes out every night has eyes in class. He's like, yeah a lot lot obviously burned off always on camera because we never pays they pay you. Yeah, so that's that's the team of the decade.	
3	We rifle through the worst one I got. Yeah. I've got work really. Well. You do the worse one then ya gonna do it. Do you know you won't take long here? Going how are you go first? Because I've got well, this won't cause an absolute war and I said it before recording Martinez is my worst one. I just thought it was awful you that like Bobby Lonergan hates God phileas Fogg / - right back for layer. I think the guy is awful Miranda Center back. Yeah. I've got him Roger Johnson. I thought after e which started off right then he was absolutely horrendous. I thought maybe West Brom we lost five. I think that's what's more. Yeah. Yeah. Did you hear the 77 Club when he came on a not-so-nice uncle that's yours the old gold. What's a just like call me feel sorry for me, please General Van Dam left-back controversial but comfortable three times and he's got a wife at home. Sick Greg Halford right-wing awful. Can you pronounce that Peter? I'm a younger. Yes. It's prints on the anger and pizza pizza. Just like you said Dave I put him in Just Cause he was all at once you sign the contract. He was awful Jamie O'Hara he as good at the point. I left wing my - burn baby burn laughing. I'm pronouncing Brenda not front, which is Welsh for Hill Leo Bonner Cheney is one of our worst ones.	
1	Yeah.	
3	I remember when he first signed me my maker speaker Mike Lewis and he was like Eno player. He's awful. We wouldn't say he's going to be real we wouldn't be where we are today without bond. It was like it was awful my offer.	
1	So, you know know you got you got Granite whole Yonex agbo, and you picked Leo but it's Xena grunts growls grunts like one.	
3	Yes, I did that quite quick, but they just won't come to my head when I speak about it might seems a bit. It's very similar. The only difference is I've got Cameron ball three Jackson at left-back. All right, man. Where is he now? I mean I didn't exist.	
1	He was okay, but he just did not play member.	
3	We do. We beat Newcastle to nil away and jams. You've got that guy as oil for a centre-back.	
1	Yeah, I'll slice of Debut.	
3	Yeah, you do. Yeah, welcome to the welcome to England Casper gorks or shall I whoo Dean Saunders signed because he had the highest heading percentage in the championship fight Football manager a get Jansen.	
1	Fuck I ever on water in Icelandic Roger Johnson.	
3	Use Terrible's Jemaine Penance.	
1	Oh, yeah, he wore at me.	
3	I thought you saw that I thought it was aimed at me because I shaved it. I showed earlier and then at that moment he turned around. He's got the time that Jamie carragher offered you well in the very bad did happen go tell everyone about no, I've already mentioned it. You don't find it and then you can excite bow and Paul Gladden as well.	
1	I'm glad to see I forgot to eat.	
3	No because the rest of the same.	
1	I doing Min alfi Solomon's impression as well. What do you want? The team will do the team in the alpha Solomon's in brought robbery. I want to know we got a deal on a good in Gold left-back, Georgia Loco, but	
3	Not say that name on the worst team.	
1	We love George what these are it was just two goals against Monday night. Yeah, I still play he was just technically he's he's a fan favorite with you going to technical ability. He was he was pants yet. Even he was he was he was he was a strength Merchant.	
3	That's when you see the video of him recently jumping off a body double.	
1	There was a helicopter you're doing and then while sent her off cash would go cooks and Danny buddy.	
3	You can't rely on up Danny laughs Danny bus Championship Edition. I agree.	
1	You can't if you're being kept out the team by Ron Benny. We need sir - that right back.	
3	I've gone for Greg Halford. Yeah, I had him. Yeah.	
1	My Midfield to is a the Fantastic pivot of George survival. And that's cruel and Egger Johnson. I just thought it sounded absolutely nothing when he played the post against Chelsea we scored maybe even on the street he scored. About three or four straight games.	
3	He was my wife tires are he's got on Jimbo fix it never have I heard such a deathly silence gonna totally got crickets down there.	
1	Yeah purple purple on my boy players are Tommy Roe and Adam Hamill. Did he punch the paramedic Mike?	
3	All my time hop, I forever see tweets from about 2010 saying why isnt Adam Hamill playing I was desperate for him to play.	
1	You didn't play that much but he was rubbish more to strike as I grant Holt and Joe Mason.	
3	Yeah magic rule a nation must disappoint. You should Wonder knee or two children.	
1	He's got a couple but let's think about that is when walls rejected don't like a massive offer. For off Bristol City for my deadline day and then he just did it the pay three million pounds for him. I've been offered usurped by Bristol city.	
3	That was the same transfer window that we sold a phobia news going to come in and replace him. I thought he was really not lethal, but he just couldn't hit a barn door was all right.	
1	He was pretty highly touted its Paris million at the Queen's great because in America now, yeah, I think he's it to be jackpot use it to Colorado. No you came back. You place a lot of Plymouth assumption. Wow level the well, yeah. There we go. Dave Let's Plays man. I'm a pretty positive fans. I'd already slag people off really side come ropes at molyneux.
