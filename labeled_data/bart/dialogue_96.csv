This is a very special episode where we have a guest on we recorded in a different way than we usually do. So if it sounds different, that's why please enjoy. Hey everybody and welcome back to another hop up cast today. We have a special guest with us Tina.	
1	Hello. Hello.	
3	Nate was away. So I have to play I guess that's not how it goes. So we had we actually we're going to have her on last weekend, but then like this that and the other happened and then the battle pass drop, so it was like, oh it was one thing after another wasn't it?	
1	Yes, it definitely was but you know now we we can talk about the Battle past two.	
3	Yeah. Yeah. I mean first off like what were your what were your impressions obviously, you know ours.	
1	You know, I'm definitely I definitely fall into the group that bought the battle past just to support respawn is their first season. I mean, I am not expecting like Fortnight level battle pass stuff, right? So yeah, I wasn't I was disappointed but I mean, I'm I have high hopes for the season 2. Yeah.	
3	Yeah, we'll definitely have to see him. Obviously, I've given my I've given my opinion out into separate podcast. I don't want to get too much into it, but it's I can definitely see your point. And I mean that's why at the end of the our last hop up cast. I tried to like kind of Bring It Down be like, all right, guys, you know what? Thanks your thanks respond because I mean we really do mean it. I mean it was super easy for us to be like me happy but instead with you know, we wanted to end it on really good note. So that's that's why we went that way because you know, Of like you it is pretty much just it is pretty much just like supporting respawn and you know saying all right, you know this this one's this one's a given I guess, you know for now because I mean there's not like they can do anything about it.	
1	Exactly and I think I think a lot more people will be critical of the second season, like hoping that they kind of learn from how the community has provided feedback about the first season because I know I think the consensus overall There's this disappointment and liverworts and I think a lot of people don't like that 20% of the battle pass is just all those badges those number badges that no one's going to use. Yeah. Yeah.	
3	I think it is the repeating like that's what triggered Nate like it was halfway into that. I still oh my God, I would I took way too much pleasure in it because it was just like it was so funny to see him go there but I think what really triggered him was actually like some of the audio Clips he started listening to him and was like, hey, it's season one and then Bangalore. Hey, it's season one caustic. Hey, it's season one.	
1	It's like I'm basically it had like all the opening season intro for exactly legend of the bit disappointed. I don't think some of my friends have had a chance to listen to all the audios. I think they'll be up in arms about it. Did they realize that they're just variants of the same same thing?	
3	Over and over again, but hey now, it's Mina saying it so, you know exactly so I mean, let's let's talk a little bit first before we get into the topic of the week. So how how long have you been playing it to? Have you been playing it from the very beginning?	
1	Yes. Okay. So a little tip about me I was a big Titanfall 2 fan.	
3	Hell. Yeah, I think most people are most of the people who are like true gamers.	
1	It's a good game and I felt so bad for respawn not getting the attention they deserved and I was actually looking forward to Titanfall 3 and I think I was I just happened to stumble over a live stream. That was the day they announced Apex nice. So I downloaded the day came out and I've been playing it since yeah, definitely.	
3	Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's a lot of people's like I I definitely I think the first time I technically heard of it. Clean prints gaming and he's he talked about it. And he was like, you know, oh, hey, here's the secret project. I think even had the name of that Apex Legends. I don't know if like, I don't know if he knew that it was the real name or whatever. Like I don't know what his sources are but like he was actually talking about the fact that it was going to be a battle or who's going to be a battle royale that it wasn't going to be in the TitanFall Universe. I don't think he said anything about classes. So there was a few things that he got wrong, but that was actually the first time I ever heard of it and I'm like Well, that's kind of cool. I mean, I like a lot of people, you know, love Titanfall 2 and it came out and yeah, it was very much. It was very much the same thing you were saying just like well dang it, you know every they were put to they were put to death by EA and so for for it to kind of turn around into this was probably one of the most amazing things. I mean the little a lot of people kind of already talked about it, but it's just the fact that is like hey, you know this game that we made well, it's already And it's like wait. What?	
1	Yeah, that was the thing that surprised me because I stumbled over I think it was I was Googling it and I saw Kotaku like they had at this press release that respawn might drop Apex Legends. Like what is this and it they had like Titanfall 3 kind of linked into the article itself. And then when it clicked on live stream, that was when I realized oh by the way guys, you can play it tonight so that yeah, I I didn't I didn't hear about it before the day. At open when did you find out kind of like heard the rumors?	
3	I want to say it was the week right before it was it was right before like maybe even like the Thursday before it was very close and that some streamers were kind of hinting.	
1	Yeah before but I like I guess the streamers I were following I was falling but didn't hint at it. But I don't think they were the ones who are playing Apex either the ones you were watching respect the non-disclosure agreement. Exactly.	
3	I mean yeah, there was definitely some people who leaked it if the clean prints out of all the freaking people, you know, honestly, I don't know about you but I feel like in the last week.	
1	Everyone's gone. Pretty darn good at the game. Yes, the skill level has shot through the roof. I don't know if it's because the battle pass brought back all the sweat.	
3	He's that's a good term.	
1	I feel like that literally like the day the battle Fast Draw Tite. Klodin, I'm like so excited. Like I've got like a decent amount of wins under each with my Legends and I was like, yeah, I'm like, I'm going to like start on this Belfast. I'm going to hopefully end up in top-tier know I was getting slaughtered by people like race with a thousand kills was like Wow, every love you is the champion was a thousand kill rates and and I was just so blown away because the week before that you could have some winners that like probably just started the game. The spike and skill just sawed through the roof overnight.	
3	Yeah. I mean, I'm actually you kind of make me feel a little bit better about myself because I thought it was just me because literally this is how it happened it came out and I want to say I started the stream because I think it was what was it was either 11 or noon my time. And so I started the stream, of course my wife got off right around the same time, so I had to go get freaking groceries. But I only got uh game in I got a single game in I got two kills which you know for me was actually really cool. But I got I got both of the kills because of the jump at the first was in midair and then the other one was after I had landed so it felt really satisfying and I'm like sweet this is how I'm starting off the season then literally I go grocery shopping. I get home. I get some food for the kids, you know, like shut up go over there and he And then I start my stream again and just out like you said I just started getting slaughtered left and right it was to the point where like high morale was just so low and I'm just like, oh my God, I'm I'm trash I hate this and yeah, I mean like I feel a little bit better knowing that it's not just me that apparently was a lot of people because yeah, that was that was what happened with me. It was so yeah. Oh my God, I felt bad for a couple of reasons. I mean for one, obviously, I have a podcast where or like here's some tips and tricks and how to get kills and so to get slaughtered like that really really puts a damper on your mood. That's number one. But then number two is I'm trying to stream it. So like for anybody heard out there who doesn't know I'm a bus driver and this week happened to be this week happened to be spring break for the Boise school district or so. I'm like, okay, I don't have to go to work. This is awesome. I have a whole week division to Now they're dropping the battle pass. And so I was starting to try to get a little bit of a schedule for my twitch going. And so I started that but I'm doing horrible just absolutely terrible and it yeah, it felt horrible and I'm like the other side of the coin is the fact that it's like well, I'm trying to entertain people but it is so hard to entertain somebody when you're just not having a good time. I mean just losing one after another after another. I was just like okay, this is this deck dad's when I get it.	
1	Oh, you know, I honestly feel the same way and it's funny because like I met one of my friends that I play on the regular with now and he's so good. Like I really like he's he on average. He talks about a thousand to two thousand damage easily Perfect Choice. Okay, the battle pass happened and we're playing and he's just like, oh my God, everybody's got so much better at everyone same spot on like he can keep up with Sometimes like I've had some bad days. I'm like, you know, what dude I just gotta like a log off anymore and I'm gonna kill the vibe for this party, but it's funny that you brought up the octane jump pad to because I'm so happy that you got this cool trick shot like in the air kill someone I tried doing that and my buddy throws down jump pad and the squad is all like on the other side of this house that we needed to get over and he throws it down he Is he can't he knocks someone like I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm gonna go in there and I'm Gonna Knock.	
3	Hey, you hold my beer.	
1	I got this exactly and you know Mike I had a fully kitted are 301 and I had a peacekeeper.	
3	I emptied a whole clip on this Mirage and then missed the Peacekeeper they've mirages I swear there was two rounds right in a row, but I got killed by a mirage. The first one was because of a decoy right before I started trying to unload them like way too. Second I totally got Bamboozled.	
1	I didn't get bamboozled. My aim was just crappy when it jumped over that house. That's funny that you pointed that out because my friend plays Mirage and whenever he plays Mirage, it's just like he gets his best games and it's just he's a Slaughters the lobby.	
3	It's almost like it's almost worse getting killed by our Mirage because you know that his quip is just so cocky.	
1	Yeah. Yeah, exactly and and you know, like he's actually his his like a Bility is you don't really fall for it too much anymore. Maybe the odd Bamboozled. Yeah, I guess it is, alt isn't that great. But for some odd reason it's always like the mirages are the sweatiest randos. You're gonna get aside from the raids.	
3	Yeah. Yeah mangalore's to I guess those are like, yeah and I feel like octane is going to become that very very quickly because those are the people who want to go fast and want to just like get around you as quickly as	
1	Possible exactly that's speed boost like those speed boosts the way it changes the game entirely.	
3	So let's go ahead. Let's jump let's jump. Let's drop it drop right into our topic of the week, which is ranking the Drop Zones. So we've gone through our characters. We ranked all of them. We even did octane for our last, you know Hub cast. Oh gee and so yeah, I thought like well, Obviously, the next thing we have is our is our Drop Zones so mean you talked about it before we agreed pretty much on everything. We're like, okay. This is a very good order we like it. So let's start with number ten. Number ten is Bunker bunker is is very much. Like we I think we both agreed bunker is very much at the last end of it because it does have some good loot. But then you also have to kind of like cross your fingers.	
1	Yeah, it's a high-risk high-reward. Yeah, you gotta get the bunker first. If you don't then it might be a little bit of a challenge.	
3	Yeah, I don't I don't love it. I like it more as like I think like a second place to go to like if I drop near it. I might go there and like okay nobody's been here or somebody has but maybe they had to drop something. I don't know so I don't like it to be my very first drop but every once in a while some of the You know, they'll be the jumpmaster and they'll be like, alright, we're going to Bunker and I'm like, all right, I do have to admit. I had one of my coolest coolest kills there because you have to tell me. Yeah, I dropped into a bunker bunker. I dropped into it. I want to say it was on the west side. So the one with like the kind of the archway or whatever and then the the two or three boxes there so I dropped. On that side and I dropped in a there. There's a bluff Honda. He's right there and I'm like, oh no no, no, she's gonna get me. I mean, I'm dead. I like I like in my mind. I had already given up here, you know, I was like, you know what? I'm not going to go down without a fight. So I just started hitting him hitting him over and over again and they're just like kind of running around like like they're brand new player in the like what's going on what's going on? And so finally a finished him off with a flying kick or whatever then all of a sudden I hear the gunfire from my teammates. Are somewhere else on like okay, I gotta grab something grab something and grab something and then I think I came up behind a couple of people and got them ended up getting knocked a little bit later, but it was like that rush or whatever. That was just like yeah, I'm not going down without a fight and I definitely didn't think it was gonna work because they actually got a gun and so they shot but it was a most home Peak. So the shot three times miss me two of them. So it was kind of crazy so number. Nine is going to be relay and relay. I felt like was a pretty good choice because I really like the wetlands. So whether or not you jump or you drop at Wetlands, like maybe you weren't quite able to get it to relay, but the good thing is that there's that redeploy right there. So regardless of where the circle is with that redeploy dropping there's really cool because you can kind of just take your time.	
1	Yeah, exactly. And I mean sometimes Relay can be a busy dropped. To so if you if your squad wants to bail just south of it as Wetlands. So here's another area with decent amount of loot. It's just it's a good place. It's a good place to drop for sure and strategically place yourself after definitely.	
3	Then number eight was Cascades, you know what it was when it started getting down because we actually went from one to ten when we were making the list. So we're getting towards the end of it as like, okay. Well do we want Bridges or Cascades and you shouted out Cascades and I'm like, oh, that's a good point.	
1	Yeah, it's just a few more houses with a few more areas for loot spawn. I spend sometimes Bridges could be a hit or a Miss. Like you could find a bunch of Shield cells or maybe and a couple of mozambique's and bridges and then other times maybe all you'll run out with decent load out.	
3	Next one number seven is Skull town which from the map. I'm actually surprised that it's not a purple Landing Zone. I could have swore. The purple zone right think they drop their like it's an orange Zone. Yeah, and I think and I think we talked a little bit beforehand, but I think one of the main reasons why it is such a good drop zone. Is that even though it might not have the best quality gear? It has the most quantity of gear. So you might not get you might not get your purple armor. You might not find like an orange helmet, but you will get a lot of it. So if you do find Shield cores, you're going to find a lot of them. You're going to find a lot of Medics you're going to find some gun and a good amount of ammo and then kind of like our one story about how we got down in this skull town, you know, if you're able to survive that encounter, you can have like a lot to choose from you can have up to like, you know anywhere from 15 to 20 death boxes should be like, what do I want? Oh, this guy had this I'm just going to pick that up that there.	
1	Yeah exactly and it's funny because well everyone. All it like everyone will know that it's hot Drop. Everyone will drop on the sides and they'll all run into the middle to fight. Yep. So, you know, all 20 boxes will be right in the middle pretty much. Yeah, you can just literally take us like side step to the next death box and help yourself.	
3	Exactly. Then number six. We got the slums. The slums is probably one of my more favorite ones and it's kind of I think it'd be kind of similar to skull town where you might not be able to get the best quality, but there is a lot Yes, I maybe it's because of all the different buildings and it's similar to skull town. But obviously just slightly different. I do like I almost always go up to the to the places up on the zip line up in the caves. I almost always go there and I'm usually able to find you know decent gear up there. I might not I mean, I might not find like the best obviously but I find some decent stuff up there plus depending on if I'm playing with randos, which is almost all the time. But if I'm playing with randos not a a lot of them think to go up there so we don't have to struggle to get loot.	
1	You know, what funny thing that you just said that I actually didn't know those houses existed to like about a week ago. We had to bail on Landing in slums just because there's so many people going and then my one friend took us under it's like kind of underneath the waterfall right? Are you talking? Okay? How's this? Yeah, I was like there's places here. So that yeah, like it's definitely a kind of nice little area tucked away. Yeah.	
3	Now he kind of blew the secret so I know you know we but I do like going up there because I don't I just don't I don't have to struggle as much, you know going from house to house and then having somebody, you know accidentally pick something up or whatever now if they have their mic, I'll definitely yell at them, but they don't always listen so going up. Actually those houses is really nice not having to worry about okay and then not only that but then I can get kitted up enough where I'm like, hey guys, there's a you know, there's armor up here. There's this up here. Yeah, a little bit more support that way so it's really fine armor and shields up there.	
1	Yeah, that's what I've noticed now that I know it exists and I do all right number five is the swamps.	
3	I was actually surprised to see this as a purple because much like skull town and much like slums. There's a lot of houses here. So not only is it a lot of houses, but it's also a high tier area. And so this is really good because Depending on if you're the only Squad that lands there and I feel like not a lot of people this is very underrated place.	
1	It is like I think the hottest time I've ever dropped in swamps was maybe with two other teams. Mmm.	
3	It's just it's not a place that a lot of people go to I don't I don't and I don't know why I think maybe it's the mentality the mentality is they see the water and they think it slows him down and it does to a certain degree because like you can't slide but it doesn't actually like physically slow you down. And maybe that's what maybe it's just this mental thing where they're like, oh, I'm going to be sloshing through the water. It's like not really I mean even some of like the tree houses because they have boxes up there to even some of the tree houses. You can get some really good loot out of there.	
1	Yeah, like it's either whenever my friends and I dropped their we all one of us always go leaves with like purple armor. So it's it's really honestly a great place. I feel like it's the moisty Meyer. We're not nice. Yeah something Doesn't hit that part of the island and get rid of swamps, but I don't know it's funny that you said that too because moisty was full of water and people and that's load people down. So maybe people have that mentality about so yeah.	
3	Yeah, they're they're taking their Fortnight, you know connoisseurs and trying to bring it over here. Like now that stuff doesn't fly all the time. It doesn't come go one to one all the time, you know, and I mean, I think the only thing is like, yeah, you can't really slide as as good but your actual like speed Really isn't affected all and so yeah, I think maybe it is just a mind thing. So we just opened up the floodgates now, it's just going to be like everybody's going there taking vacations. We're good. We ruined it speaking of ruining it number four is the pit. The I think my favorite thing about the pit is nine times out of time then again, if I drop at the pit, my next stop will always be the slums because because of that Redeploy their it is always really good. And I mean no matter where the ring is. The redeploy will get you close enough where you can kind of take your time. So you can you can go all over the pit. You can go all over the slums get to that Secrets place that we were talking about and still have enough time like okay, I better go ahead and hit that redeploy. And then you start going towards, you know, like the what's that bunker called like to the West I mean, it's just like this big kind of Hangs over the mountain kind of hangs over the Cascades and stuff. I don't know what it's I don't know if that's named technically. So it's kind of like what it's just a little bit south of artillery, right exactly that so you can kind of start heading that way you won't make it because there's a little Bridge area but even that bridge area has some decent loot. I mean, I don't think you'll have high tier loot but it is a there's a good little stop there along the way and then even if the circles bearing down on you the the Outer Circle will most likely be somewhere around like Cascades. You know that first or that round to Circle usually will be right around Cascades no matter where it ends up on the on the map so you can make it there. Absolutely. No problem.	
1	Yeah, I totally agree. I feel like I definitely will have to use that strategy more that in the pit. But there's also something just south of the pit. I don't think it's kind of like a meme on the internet right now. We're yeah gold armor and helmets appear or it's the giving tree of Apex. Yeah, these Supply boxes just outside of this little metal Archway. So pit has gold armor in it or has a higher chance of it, but I don't know if it's true or not. I witnessed it myself, but they have spoken about it and some people.	
3	You but I believe I believe everything you hear on the internet unless it's that Apex Hub cast is awesome.	
1	You can totally believe that now everyone's going to drop their too. Darn there goes my gold armor.	
3	Yep. There you go. Number three is the Thunderdome. I feel like when we were talking about it was like Thunderdome needs to make top three because the Thunderdome it's just fun, aesthetically as far as like the different levels that you have the different buildings you can Weighs almost guarantee a purple and like I'd say anywhere from seven to eight out of ten times. It'll be right in the center. So if you time it just right you can land like right next to it was like yeah purple armor.	
1	Yeah, we always like me and my friends we always raise for it, of course the octopus octopus, right? But yeah, no, I think Thunderdome it's just so underrated because that's like like swamps. It's not a very Popular spot to land, even though the loot is actually quite decent the number of times. I've walked out with purple armor and Spitfires. Like that's that's and game material.	
3	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it is another mental thing like we were talking about the swamps like it's the Thunderdome. Welcome to the Thunderdome bitch.	
1	I mean everybody's kind of enticed to go to skull town which is right next door.	
3	So I know it's it. I don't want to keep making the references but it is very much tilted as Far as like people think that oh, I'm gonna get the best loot here, but it's like no dude just go a little bit Southwest you got something way better Thunderdome is quite literally if you look at the map that we're looking at Thunderdome is literally surrounded by mid-tier things. So if you go to Thunderdome first, you have three different places to choose from that you can still get mid-tier stuff from yeah exactly.	
1	Like you can get your good guns your good armor a decent amount of Shields and Thunderdome and then you can go to the It's your areas for your ammo afterwards. Absolutely. It's a really good place to drop.	
3	Yeah, so it had to make it in the top three number two Air Base. I feel like this is probably between this and number one. Obviously, these are my two favorite places. So this was probably the hardest as far as like putting it in the in the list, but air base is just so much fun.	
1	And it honestly is and the amount of teams that drop their right. It felt like I was just telling you earlier to it's so much fun to punch someone off the side of their face just like this is Sparta. Exactly. Everyone will land in the South part of air base and it'll all be on that Runway with those three crates and we'll just all have a bunch battle. The one Squad makes it all the live.	
3	Yeah, and I mean, it's just I feel like another reason is I've dropped there so many times now there and there and like the wetlands and things like that. I've dropped so much that I'm so used to the layout of it. I feel like I have that that first like hot Drop if I was going to hard drive anywhere it would be there and then obviously number one but it's like those are the places that I'm so comfortable with that. I feel like I know the angles I know the corners and I really I just like the setup of it and then if you get in a pinch using that zip line across the tooth, you know the to He's or whatever is really nice because you hit somebody just right.	
1	It's nice to see their body just like a drop down exactly one thing that I learned in one of my games if if you and the opponent is using the zip line and same time going the opposite directions. He will both just Bonk each other and fall to your death. Really? Yeah. That's awesome. I hopped on the zipline and I'm heading over there and this guy like had a gun. I didn't have a gun. I was just going to go over there and just Punch right died but he and I didn't know why I didn't shoot. He just hopped on the zipline and came straight at me and we both like a bumped into each other and fell to her death. So maybe I got the kill so I was kind of happy with that right you like I'll take it.	
3	I'll take it.	
1	This is team died. So I you know, I got the kill and I got the respawn so I'm good. That's just to let you guys know if someone else is hopping on that zip line, right? It don't jump fun.	
3	Well, dude, I mean have faith in your teeth. All right number one, but my favorite artillery is our number one. Yes, and I mean I definitely have to agree. This is this is the other one where I was talking about like hot dropping here isn't that bad? Because I feel like I know the corners I know everything hurt a lot of it, you know.	
1	Yeah and then the two corridors leading out of artillery. Well that's like a decent amount of loot as well.	
3	Yeah, and it's definitely the levels as well like the different.	
1	Evils of the buildings and the bunker on that's built into like the side of the mountain exactly and I and I think like that's the one area that I love how you can play at different levels and regardless of the legend that you are. You're not kind of hindered because you can basically like the walls are low enough that you could mantle right up to the top floor. Yeah, so like it so it's all like if you're a Pathfinder, you've got instant High ground and no one else can come up and get you and plus you got that balloon on the Side so you can yeah, you gonna come back.	
3	Yeah having the having the redeploy. Once again kind of just means you can kind of take your you could take your time. You don't have to worry too much and you can either go to the redeploy or you can go to that thing just to the South which was the overhanging bunker and then boom there's Cascades right there Cascades is the mid-tier and it also has the redeploy right there. So no matter where even if the circle is going all the way down to like Thunderdome like you can really take your time in that area. I think that's what's so enticing about is no matter where the circle is going. You have you have a couple of avenues that you can go you can go to the read a pulley right there, or you can go down to Cascades kind of get a feel like okay. Has anybody been here and regardless you still got that other redeploy. You got a lot to choose from and I think that's that's probably the main reason. It's number one.	
1	I I totally agree and I think it's so yeah like the loose just great and all the places that you need to go to. Later, as you're moving towards the circle is just it's perfect. It just lines itself up. Yeah, we're definitely all right.	
3	So the last thing we'll do is we're going to go into some reader mail. Okay, first up we have Travis. Hey guys and girl with the release of Apex Legends with with the release of Apex. Legends came the inspiration to replay Titanfall 2 campaign upon completion of the campaign. I noticed something pretty interesting in the final mission. There is a huge reference towards Apex Legends. I was dumbfounded the Bounty Hunter that catches you in Titanfall 2 campaign mentions Apex Legends and gives you a and Apex card as a sort of invite to the game pretty cool. This could also eat or this could also even have some relevance on future characters in Apex. Maybe. Could you possibly be Pilot Jack Cooper in Apex or even the Bounty Hunter mercenary General martyr. What are ya'lls thoughts? I mean, we talked a little bit about Titanfall. So I felt like that was a perfect email to bring up. I mean, I honestly did not know that I full disclosure. I'm sorry. I'd actually didn't get all the way through the Titanfall campaign or whatever so I didn't see this but Travis I didn't finish it. It's oh, yeah, I know. II I've always wanted to and it was just one of those things like I think when I happened to pick it up I have to pick it up on a little bit of a sale or something. I didn't pick it up on day one, but I absolutely love the multiplayer and when I play a game and I really really like the multiplayer. It's kind of hard to bring myself to to play the campaign the campaign like really really good example is like a battlefield one. I really like Battlefield ones multiplayer, but the second I went into Campaign and I started to die. I try throwing down a med pack and I'm like, oh, that's right. I can't do that. Yeah, so there was just so many moments like that. I just couldn't get over it.	
1	I think yeah, I think that's going to be the one thing that's going to be a little bit of a struggle in the type fall to a campaign. Like I was just like you I bought Titanfall 2 on sale like probably 20 bucks. It was yeah, it definitely wasn't on release and bought it for the campaign because my friends were telling me I had needed to play the game but I got caught up in the multiplayer. I think I was playing the multiplayer for a month before I actually decided okay. I'm going to To pick away at the campaign and the campaign honestly is a lot shorter than what you expect. Right? Yeah, you don't have to dedicate too long to it. But the moment I finished that campaign Titanfall instantly became one of my favorite games of all time. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't want to blow the ending and it will hear our kids though. I mean the story itself is probably the reason why a lot of people are a big Titanfall 2 fans, but the whole Apex Legends reference Reference I think that was that's like really really cool. And I know that the I hope that they respond cut it does the same thing they did with Titanfall 2 was they sometimes had a little bit of lore that they would add on to the game in general, but you had to find on the internet in terms of like like scripted cartoons or something, but I hope that they do that with Apex just to give a bit more background to all the characters and I don't know about the whole Jack Cooper Legend to like I would love that. Yeah, but I feel like his ability is might be a bit o p yeah.	
3	Yeah, there was somebody on on the interweb. I think I want to say was just a couple of days after it came out. They put out one of those like concept Arts of of Titanfall pilot. And so I want to say like the passive was the passive was double jump. I think they're know the passive was the passive was wall running. I think oh gosh. we'll jump was in there somewhere and then I can't remember what the can't remember the Oldham it is and I'm like, you know, I think that could be the only way that like a straight-up pilot could make its way into it is that if the clinic call in the Titan and then that kind of defeats the purpose of it, but to have a character who could like double jump or whatever that yeah, that could kind of be like a grappling hook or a jump pad in a sense that you know, hey, I'm just going to double jump and as long as that was like his passive and it wasn't like Then you had to like recharge on I don't know that could be kind of cool. I mean, I feel like they're definitely need I feel like they're definitely needs to be like maybe a stamina bar on it so that you could have just double don't double jump double double double double double.	
1	Exactly. Well, that's the one thing I was kind of fearing was like cause you played a bit of the multiplayer to you kind of got you you kind of got them familiar with some of these people who are like Titanfall veterans where they were grappling and then once they got like to a certain speed you basically could just go around the map by sliding and sliding and jumping over and over and never losing speed and every time you do you use the grapple, right? So exactly like I think that would make it pretty hard for Apex just because time to kill is just so much slower in Apex and if someone's moving that fast it might be a little bit difficult true true about it.	
3	Yeah. Yeah the wall running. I feel like I don't think is there were there are certain parts that I've noticed. It's like okay, here's this pipe for instance and it has this flat surface on the side of it now granted you couldn't mantle that but it's like it how long it is unlike this kind of seems like they have real running in it and they just they took it out because exact there's some parts on the map where I'm like that that is clearly a wall running wall, but for some reason it's here and it's just taken out or something. I would like it limited time event. I'll be honest. I'd like it limited time. We're like while running and All jumping we're just you know, everybody had it. You know, I feel like that would be really cool. And I mean maybe even maybe even for solos, you know, if we get solos because the main reason at least this is from the developers themselves the main reason they took it out was because it encourages people to split up but if we're doing solos we don't have to worry about splitting up it would be kind of cool to wall run.	
1	That would be cool. I wonder it to how the Legends would work in solos no abilities.	
3	I also Find out till the day I die bunch of Pilots running around. I mean, I feel like they need to just have a generic looking person or you can choose your Legend. You just don't get the abilities because I just imagine everybody choosing Bangalore everybody choosing wraith or everybody choosing octane for that matter. Yeah, because having that, you know regenerating health or whatever would be really nice. And so I feel like that'd be the only well I guess without the abilities you wouldn't have the great generated. Never mind.	
1	I'm stupid, but	
3	I feel like that's the only way you can make it work and not feel because I mean especially if you think about Gibraltar and Bangalore for that matter, they have airstrikes and if you just happen to be a person all by yourself and you're getting are striked, that would be frustrating as hell.	
1	Exactly. So, yeah, I don't know how they would be able to incorporate like all the wall running and just and the island itself there certain areas that aren't made for all of that running. But I mean at the same time I wouldn't be too choked if they decided. So they could limit I'm like game just to just to have like a fast-paced does a fast paced around where it's like yeah, we're constantly moving.	
3	Yeah, I think that'd be cool. Like the a blitz around like some of the other battle rifles have had for the circle just keeps moving.	
1	So you're forced to keep running around.	
3	Yeah. I think that'd be really cool. I think it would be really cool.	
1	Oh, I was just going to ask you to like, what do you think about Titans? I know that they had in there like a some in their file. Files they had tried it and they said it didn't work. But but it always keeps getting Revisited on the internet the people like what if it's like the end game where they drop Titans or something like what's your perspective on it?	
3	I like that idea for the in-game. So it's like the last squad or something and I can't remember what episode it was, but we did bring up Titans in the fact that like what if it was I think it was actually it was our first reader mail and somebody somebody had brought up like It was something like evolve. We're like there was one person on each squad or there. You know, there is they tweak the numbers so that basically it was kind of like evolved in the sense that you had to hunt down this Titan and kill it and I think something like that or something, where's this super rare item? And then you'll be able to call it in but you have to go to like certain spots to call it in the you can't just like have it call in anywhere. Yeah, I mean because once again, I hate to compare it to Fortnight, but when Fortnight has like it's Thanos limited time run. I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just have this nice little limited time thing. You have the Titans. It makes people happy, but then I guess the other problem with that. Is that what if it makes it better exactly.	
1	I agree with you that I think it should be like, I think they should revisit it for a limited time think Jessica. Test and see I think it'd be so cool to have like let's say the last three squads or something and then like a Titan drops and of course, you know, like the squads are going to run for the Titan. Yeah, because I think a lot of people who are against it and saying that a Titan might be too overpowered also doesn't realize that in Titanfall them if you're a pilot and you're not in the tighten your number one like your number one goal is the mantle that tighten and pull that battery out. The Titan is like dead within a couple seconds, right? Yes, like it would it would be testing it would change the gameplay. I love it. I would like it but I could see how people who might not be much of a Titanfall fan prior to Apex would be overwhelmed with a total of those people exist who played Apex without knowing about and it's playing Titanfall. I mean the player base is so much. Oh, that's a good point. I think they're really the last time they announced a milestone was like 50 mil. Yeah, right they like that. So I Like that definitely it wasn't what Titanfall 2 clocked but but who knows? Yeah, I mean, I feel like it would just it would just be nice just to have it and the game up a little bit so that it doesn't get into that kind of repetitious Lumpur has something people can look forward to that like old fans would be really excited for I think for sure.	
3	Yeah, it could be like this version or this Games version of like the iron Banner for 10 cents. Yeah. Yeah. We're just comes around every once in a while people get to be a excited about it. Yeah, it just kind of gift you something to be psyched for. Yeah, I think I think it's very cool.	
1	I think like, you know, like the whole like that whole Thanos Gauntlet thing in Fortnight, even though it was very overpowered and yeah read about it. It was and it was a short period you so of fun even if you got killed in three seconds when he lets someone who's that? Oh, that's right. So if so, I wouldn't even mind if I got killed by typing in a couple seconds if I could just have the chance to like fight for	
3	Food part way through the game part of me does want to try out the new Firestorm for Battlefield because I do kind of want to see like, how are they going to how are they going to handle Vehicles? Because even though like the high-tier like armored vehicles, you have to go to like a specific spot on the map and then you have to work together. And if you work together from the way it sounds is that if you work together, you get the doors open faster and therefore you can get inside. But I would like to definitely see how they do it because if they can figure it out and then you know, obviously it's ETA. So like if they can figure it out and then maybe Titanfall kind of, you know looks over their shoulder and be like, okay, maybe tighten its can work together and try to make like add it to Em are br-2. I mean cause baby you could be like a bunker type situation where you have to go to very specific part of the map. I think they have to work together, you know anything	
1	I think how you've kind of raised it to it. It works really well because the whole game tries to force you to play like a team and effective and to work together to be able to start up this Titan or unlock it or you know that kind of thing and knowing that it's at one specific location. So it's not going to be like it's going to be obviously a hot Drop. I think teams will like multiple teams will aim for it. So you'll have like that hot battle outside of that Titan, so it'll be interesting and and I'd have never played.	
3	A battlefield and yeah, well Firestone, but yeah Firestorm like we were talking about it on our Discord. So hey go to this Garden check out our Discord and have a conversation with us go to our link go to our Discord. Make sure you stay who you are. Because if you don't have the same username, I'll just really who's this girl 2. Yeah, but on Discord, we kind of talked we kind of talked about it on Discord in the sense that like probably my only problem. Like what I've seen of Firestorm actually looks really good and I'm like, okay that looks pretty cool. But there's one key problem about Firestorm and that's that I would have to buy Battlefield 5.	
1	Yeah, that's like you pay it's kind of like it's kind of like Call of Duty and blackout. Yeah, basically had to pay for yeah the arm portion right?	
3	So I don't mean I even I like Battlefield I've liked it for a while and it's one of those things that you know, one thing that I always. He's whenever I start up Apex Legends. There's always that like millisecond where I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right. EA also does this and I'm like crap. I'm supposed to hate them. Darn it.	
1	Why do I love them so much.	
3	I'm like a battered girl and I'm just like, why do I love you? Because I mean like in general like Battlefield. That's the only reasonable not only reason I mean, there's plenty of reasons, but that's like one of the only reasons I didn't buy Battlefield 5 is the fact that EA has Been doing some really questionable things in the past. And I mean, I tried the beta out for Battlefield 5 and it was very much like okay, this is more Battlefield and it wasn't a bad thing necessarily. It's just that like when I looked at that plus all the other things coming out around it. I was like that $60 just ended up going somewhere else now technically now, I think I could probably end up picking up on like a really good deal or something, but then that's still like money that I'd have to put towards that instead of something.	
1	Else and it's just like like and then the thing too is like well, you don't know how the games like how the modes going to play right?	
3	Exactly might be janky like a might be janky or Vehicles.	
1	Yeah. And so you bought your by this game and then you'll play the BR and then you'll realize like, oh, it's not a smooth running. Let's say its apex like right off the get-go, right? So, I don't know. How do you feel about the fact that EA is dropping another BRC one of its biggest VR is right.	
3	Now that's the yeah, that's that's confusing. I mean cuz it's almost like a Titanfall 2 situation. But now it's Battlefield that's Battlefield has turned into the TitanFall 2 of the of 2019 because it's like who's going to be playing. I mean, I'm sure there's millions of people who picked up Battlefield 5 and they might even still have it on their fan base for sure.	
1	Yes. Yes 5, yeah.	
3	I mean there's still a lot of people out there, but I just wonder how many are still. attached to it enough where they're like, okay, I mean, this is obviously a marketing thing where locate their they're releasing it so that they can get their people back but I'm wondering other than the people who have already bought it other than the people who have already been enjoying Battlefield 5 who really wants to get Battlefield 5, it's just for the Battle Royale because I've been I've been preaching it from the heavens that like Pub G like I could technically play that now I could go on my PlayStation I could Pay the money to buy our to purchase it or exactly download it but then I have to pee I have to pay money. It's like right now I have H1Z1 which is very similar. I know there's going to be tons of people out there who want to be like well actually but H1Z1 very similar you have realm Royale, which is nice. I didn't absolutely love it, but I liked it you have Fortnight and now you have Apex. Why in God's name would I spend money on pube G? Just play something that I'm really already playing in a better version and I know like like well, how do you know you've never played it? But I know I know. Yeah, you just know in your heart.	
1	It's actually like it. You don't have to desire to pay for it and play it. That means that like you ready finding that Phil somewhere else. So I think I don't know.	
3	It's interest Ari. I know you're a lady, but that was sort of a giggity.	
1	Hey I go and listen you did that's the episode or not. But you need to like it just like a little a little blooper at the end find easy like free stuff out there. Why would you why would you spend money on this? And then the fact that it's EA once again doing this to itself like I don't I don't understand exactly the business model behind dropping similar games at similar times.	
3	It's yeah, it's they're trying to saturate the market that's always kind of been there thing, which is also the one of the main reasons. I didn't want to buy Battlefield 5 because it's like it's they've been trying to saturate the market so much which is also like one reason I'd be kind of scared for Apex because it's like, you know how much now that now that it's making money because let's admit like one of the reasons EA didn't give a crap about this game beforehand is because they didn't believe in it, but now that it's making money. I'm scared for respawn because how much are there going to start trying to manipulate you spawn and like I was actually talking with Nate and just wasn't on air. I don't think but I was actually talking to Nate and I was like, you know, well like $18 for a skin that's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. It's a gun come on and I wondered to myself now respawn obviously stated that EA had no hand in making the game, but when it comes to the monetization how much of a hand is he a hat?	
1	Pain that I feel like they have a significant influence on like the pricing side of things right? It's because that's what I'm wondering the operation, right? So in declaring company the parent company kind of controls the dislike the monetary side of you think any company or like any of the subs, right? So I feel like it's definitely an EA thing like even with a discount like the if you have like EA access origins or whatever you can get 10% discount, but even then that's like still a lot of money. Yeah. Spend on a gun skin that you probably won't be using for the full game. I think that they'd still I think that they need to kind of drop the price a little bit if they want to make more but did you hear that? They made apparently 92 million dollars. Yeah before the battle path. I was like who's buying stuff in the store?	
3	I wasn't I mean I bought all admit. I bought $10 so that I could have 10 loot boxes, but I bought loot boxes. I never have bought a straight-up skin. So I'm Wondering how many people are like me I would like to I would like to see some kind of a breakdown of the analytics. Like how many people are really like the Mastiff for instance. I love the like, I think it was called The Warp Zone or something, but it pretty much look like a Nintendo controller and even have like Megaman on the screen or whatever but it's a Mastiff. You don't always get a Mastiff, but if you get like an R3 or re 99, you could get that every round if you really tried exactly right so	
1	I don't know. I don't know who spends on gunskins maybe character skins but even then I don't really I like I don't really see a lot of I like it being a surprise personally, you know, like I like I like what for instance yes like to have definitely pulls you in for sure.	
3	Yeah. I mean like for instance I bought the $10 and I got a legendary. I got a legendary Banner. Oh my God poor blood Honda. She had like the snake the snake one. So I really like that one. So any time I'm black Honda I get to have that and it's really cool. And then the other one was the G7 Scout. I got the Gold Dragon one and so like that but like I don't know how much that feeling would be towards something that like I bought it on purpose like having that. I mean, I'll God I'm speaking right to the I'm speaking right to the British people who are trying to outlaw loot boxes, but that feeling when I got as a surprise was really nice because I didn't spend 18 effing dollars on its so having it this Nice little surprise while it boom orange. I'm like, oh, I like this, you know, yes and I have to admit that that was part of what made it nice if I had to spend $18 on a gold dragon.	
1	I don't think I would have now even talked about it in the skin, but I was like, I really really like it but I don't know they'll spend 20 bucks on this gun skin. It's a little bit of a stretch to be on. Yeah, we don't use the G7.	
3	Yeah, that'll definitely fix it for you. So, I mean we definitely Definitely stretch this out to a good-sized episode. Now. I feel like you know, there's we had a really good conversation. I definitely like to have you on again if you're able to yeah, and I'll definitely look into better gear not crackling too much. Oh, no, you sound absolutely fine. So everybody thank you guys for joining us for this episode of the hop-up cast. Thank you Tina.	
1	Thank you for having me. It's such an honor.	
3	Thank you. Thank you for being our first guest of many. So we'll see you guys down in Kings Canyon where it's gonna be legen wait for it.
