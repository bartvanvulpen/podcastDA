2	Hey you guys Happy Tuesday. I hope you're having a good week. I wanted to hop on here. I think this is a big topic that isn't talked about enough or maybe you know, when you do hear about it. It's something to where it's easy to absorb in here that information but applying it to your life is it's hard, you know, because I want to talk about you know, who's in your ear like the people around you the people closest to you. They have the biggest impact on.	
4	You they have the biggest influence on you.	
2	And if you are not around people consistently who are pushing you motivating you wanting you to become better. It's going to get hard to you know, keep growing and not stay stuck and not stay stagnant and I I think about you know, my first couple years and network marketing. I think being you know, a social media marketer. I'm building a business online. You got to put yourself out there and that can be	
4	scary and you know, it's it's kind of frustrating when you're so passionate about something and you're excited and you're working towards a dream and you know, you get around people who you think are going to encourage you and they almost they don't want to ask you questions about it, or maybe they don't believe in it or maybe you know, I remember people closest to me saying things like, oh you think that's gonna last and it's it it's so disheartening when you know, you're building something that you're passionate about and you Every day in your pulled to that Vision, but the people closest to you. Don't get it. I know it's disheartening and I hope this message comes across exactly how I want it to first things first. You have to be your biggest cheerleader and you have to know every day what you're waking up and in, you know, when you're waking up like you have to know what you're working towards and you have to understand that when you are in a box of comfort, you know, you you work a regular job and you know your Living a normal average life people are comfortable with that. They applaud for you. They like that, you know, you're up and you're being normal and average but when you step outside that box and you start, you know talking I guess crazy. It would be considered crazy right like being able to create a six-figure income from home being able to you know, pay your bills in advance being able to you know, take over your parents bills or whatever your dreams are. It starts to make those people who are stuck and don't want to Any further it makes them uncomfortable and they don't know how to encourage you about it. So I do want you to remember what I've learned through my six-year MLM industry, as you know, it says a lot more about them their comfort zones and their insecurities coming out loud rather than what you're doing with your life.	
2	So I want you to know that I want you to know that when I wake up every day, I don't have this mindset of like yeah, I'm a badass anyone who knows me. I'm the furthest thing from a badass. I just have a a big heart and I love people and I know how to stay consistent and persevere. So don't ever look at me and think that my mind sets perfect. I just am constantly filling it with things that are going to grow me and you will hear me talk about self development all the time and why it's so important. It's because you know, when you are putting yourself out there in your growing and you're dreaming and evolving evolving is scary y'all it's not something that happens overnight. It is a process and you know, I think one of the biggest challenges with growing is like I said those People who don't support you or clap for you or acknowledge your success. You have to understand you are not performing for them. Did you hear me? You are not preforming for them at the end of the day when you go to bed at night and you put your head on your pillow you have to you know report to God you don't have to report to anyone else. And if you did your best you're better than you were yesterday. You're chasing that dream. He planted in your heart. You're using those god-given talents that he placed inside you. You need to go to bed with a smile on your face. Now if you are worried about what you're you know, friend from high school sat on Facebook or you know, you're a person down the street or a family member, you know, so and so you have to understand that one other people and what I've learned is everyone who is in my circle. They know me like I don't like gossip. I don't like talking about anyone like I would rather get on my knees and pray about it. Because if I say anything about you one, that's an insecurity that I'm feeling to that says more about me than it says about them. So, you know understand that when people judge you or you know, they're they're misinformed about what you're doing. It's not your job to show up and share statistics and share why you're so passionate and why it's so great and why they should believe in you you need to believe in your dang self. Okay. So every day when you wake up, you know, think about what am I working towards? Why am I? I doing these small daily habits every single day because it's not going to set you up for Success tomorrow like the work that I put in now and you know when I say work, I mean networking talking to people, you know, bringing people in my organization growing the leadership on my my team and you know growing my mind was self-development like that is all a compounded effect. It's doing those small things over and over and over again that bring you results and	
4	was intimidating in the beginning when You know people did say like oh you're going to do that network marketing thing or oh you're going to sell a product on my social media because I wasn't successful yet. I felt like I had to prove something and I will tell you feeling like you have to prove your worth who you are as a person or the business. You're pursuing girlfriend. You better get out your Bible. You better shut off your dang phone or you better get on a podcast and remember who you are and why you're here and why you're purposely positioned to be in the business you're in. You know, I know that I'm qualified to lead. The tribe I do because of the hardships I've been through and you know, when when those Storms Come I can I can put my tribe on the boat and say you know what? Let me be captain of the ship. You can't just be captain of the ship when everything's good and everything's great. You're going to have to lead the people on your boat through stormy weathers and they're going to look up to you and people don't look up to me because of my income or my rank. They look up to me because of the person I am the way I make them feel. The way I value them the way I connect with them. Okay, and this is all such a part of of the journey and that's what I want you to understand is you know, when those closest to you. They don't clap for you. They don't see what you're out here doing every day. Okay and one day, you know, they're going to see that big win and it's not to prove a point to them. But people are going to be like, you know, what I'm proud of you, you know, I remember my parents hugging me and being like Katie we're so proud of you that you get to stay home with your kids. We're so proud of you that you don't have to ask us for money anymore. We're so proud of you for you know, making the kind of money you do for your family when your parents tell you that and it's like man I grinded for four to five years to see, you know, a six-figure income and you know during those four years. It was hard when you want to feel like you have to prove a point to everyone but you have to distance yourself from people pleasing and people's approval and no you don't have to race for anyone, you know, you don't have to show up. Our society and say okay. I'm successful because I bought my dream house. I'm successful because I drive this car. No girlfriend, you're successful because you didn't give up your successful because you know, it's smart to live below your means and not try to feel like you have to show your social media all the things to get people to join. You people shouldn't be joining you because of the car you drive or the house you have people should be joining you because of the kind of woman and leader you are and I want you to remember that. I'm going to say it one more time. People should be joining you. You because of the kind of woman you are in the kind of leader. You are not your income your rank your house your car nothing like that. Those things don't matter your character. Your character is something that people sense and they feel you all know what I'm saying? When you get around those people who are commissioned breath money-hungry just focus on their their, you know, life and their income and you know, it's all about them versus you could her out a very humbling woman who is called to serve and give become that kind of woman. Well, my groceries are getting delivered. So I hope I got my message across and I hope you guys have a good rest of your afternoon, but bye.
