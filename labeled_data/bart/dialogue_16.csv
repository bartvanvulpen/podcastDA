3	Hey team, welcome to the very first episode of Love Lucy the podcast I'm super excited to be on here and making that side step across from YouTube over the podcasting. I feel like this is a better platform for what we're going to be discussing. So today I have decided to take a little bit of an interesting turn. We've been doing a few heavier type videos on YouTube lately, so I kind of wanted to	
1	Something a little bit lighter. I want to talk about five Life Lessons that I have learned get this in my life.	
3	Now these life lessons pretty dumb and the fact that I had to learn the hard way shows me that like, I feel like I'm like wow my words. Oh my God like all so I apologize today I had for feelings in my mouth. And now my mouth is still partially numb.	
1	So my brain is also partially numb from that as well. So if I lose my words like Like just then just you know, bear with me.	
3	Anyway, what I was saying or the point that I was trying to make was I feel like a lot of people don't learn these lessons or they know of these lessons but then because it never happens to them. They don't like implement it God. It's hard to explain. You know what I'm just going to tell you about these five Life Lessons. I feel like that's a better use of our time right now.	
1	I really Hope that you take something from this because God damn it. Did I have to learn this the hard way? Alright. So life lesson number one changing your hair won't mend your heart surprise surprise that that one I had to learn a few times.	
3	I swear to God every single time I go through a breakup with someone my I cut my hair off.	
1	I dye my hair I make it straight.	
3	I don't know what goes on in my head, but I decide that instead. Stead of therapy or just talking about my feelings changing my hair will do the job. Yeah. It didn't I have had bleached blond hair brown hair pink hair definitely looked towards like dabbling in a bit of blue, but I didn't go there but I can thankfully say I do not do that anymore. I'm still recovering from my last hair job.	
1	I cut all my hair off after.	
3	My break up with my boyfriend of only three months. Could you imagine if we did it for longer? God good Lord.	
1	So yeah, don't cut your hair. Just leave it alone.	
3	I would suggest going if you have a broken heart that is going and talking to your friends and going and talking to the right people that will convince you out of you know, doing something crazy like Daniel Harrow cutting it, but how to deal with a breakup that is a whole episode that I want to go into so I don't really want to talk too much on this topic because then it's just going to spoil all my great ideas on what I'm going to say for my next episode. So the next life lesson that I learned the hard way is that you can burn out you're not Invincible. That is something I learnt also hard.	
1	That was not great.	
3	Basically my life experience with this lesson. I was going very very hard at life. I was my life was	
1	Ago, I had a great job. I had a boyfriend at the time.	
3	I had amazing friends this amazing social life. I was starting to do heaps of like acting jobs and modeling jobs and like for a full year. I just was going full on I had at one point. I had three jobs at once and like one of them was performing at movie world for anyone who doesn't know what movie world is it's a theme park and I was one of the performers so that was a very high-energy job.	
1	And then after that I would go	
3	go out and be social and you know, I would never have a day where I just stopped and relaxed because I felt guilty and you know, I any day if it was a nice day outside. I like I would feel so guilty like sick in the stomach if I was inside doing nothing and I suppose like that can be a good thing sometimes but in the case of what happened to me, it's not like you need to learn how to take a break and how to take a rest and refuel yourself because the amount of Times where like I'll be trying to teach myself something and I just keep going for too many hours and then you know, the information is just not going into my head because I've been going at it for so long, you know, you need to learn how to stop and you need to learn how to listen to your body as well because your body will tell you what it needs and I think my body was telling me to stop for a bit there, but I just kept ignoring it. I just kept thinking that I was You know just getting a cold or you know, because it was also coming into like flu season when I got really sick and I just blamed it on that and that was so dumb.	
1	But basically if you don't know, I don't know how you don't know. If you're ready.	
3	Listen to my podcast you surely would know about me and my story because I don't stop talking about it. Basically last year in May. I got really sick and what when I say that I Got sick it started off with just a cold and then I got really tired all the time, but I thought it was just because I was doing so much at once but like I would like get in the lift for instance at work to go down to a different level and I just lay down on the floor for just five seconds just to be able to be horizontal and not stand up and since my job was concierge.	
1	I would have to go drive cars and so I would go down and just sit in the car and just be willing myself to start the engine.	
3	Like I just I couldn't do things and I just thought I was just tired and so then I went to the doctors and I was like, hey, I'm a bit tired. Don't know why and they're like all your think. It's an allergic reaction to penicillin.	
1	Um, sure okay. Yeah, that sounds right and then like two weeks later. I came up with this a full body red rash. My eyes was so swollen and I had to go to I was they went to the doctors and then they like put me in this little separate area the like quarantining me anyway turned out I had glandular fever which is actually incredibly common and I wouldn't be surprised if like you The person listening to it has had it and didn't even know because so maybe we'll get it and they don't even know but yeah, I got really really sick. I was in and out of Hospital only a couple of times but the second time I was in hospitals in there for quite a while and I learned how to walk again.	
3	That was interesting and I just completely lost my all my ability to talk to eat to hold my head up.	
1	You know, I have my mum helping me get dressed in the the morning and feed me my food. Like I was too tired to go on my phone and scroll on my Instagram or I was too tired to even process the images that were in front of me.	
3	So if I was watching a movie, I wouldn't even know what was going on because I just couldn't like I just couldn't process it in my head and I just I wish I could go back and recognize when my body was telling me to stop and to slow down and I wish I had of because if I had have I wouldn't have	
1	Wiped out for the 10 months that I was that's 10 months of this peak time in my life where I decide to sit at home and just watch all my other friends go out partying and having a good time and going to University and learning new things and you know doing everything that benefits their future and I just had to sit there with my life on pause.	
3	So yeah big life lesson there would be to just You know recognize like understand that you really can burn out and that you need to listen to your body because your body knows what it needs. The next life. Lesson is. Oh God, I wrote it down and it's really hard to read. Oh, yes. Alright this life lesson. You are always one step away from being homeless. That's a that's a heavy topic. Basically with this one for my own life experience. Like last know two years ago. I started working at this sandwich shop and it was all good. And then they started to give me less and less shifts to the point where I started to get no shifts and I think that was there. Of firing me, but you know, we don't need to talk about that. Let's move on quickly. I was obviously moving I was living at a home and away from my parents and I obviously needed that income to be able to pay for rent and bills and groceries. And yeah, so obviously not being able to get even not getting those shifts. Yeah, well, I mean you get it not getting shifts means I don't get money and if it wasn't for the help of my parents, I would have been out on the street because as soon as I stopped getting shifts, I started getting I started applying for new jobs. I went into places. I handed them my resumes. I applied online like I pestered people but I just couldn't get hired. No one was hiring and this is what happens. Like if you don't have that support system behind you liked what I had with my parents then it is so easy. To just exact like become homeless and that's why I have this soft spot.	
1	You know, I mean everyone should but like so spot for homeless people is because I mean, we're all just one step away from from that. I'm just so lucky that my parents were able to help me and when I got sick as well, if I didn't have my parents there, I would have nothing, you know, I would have no financial support and I wouldn't have been able to pay for my medical bills. And if I did have any money coming in all that money would go towards those medical bills and not to rent and everything like that.	
3	So I think a large portion of homeless people. Yes, it can be because of drugs and wrong choices and everything like that, but I think it also can be because they lose their job and they can't get another one or because they get severely sick and they can't work anymore and they don't have a support system behind them. And I just think that if we're all more aware of that than we all might be a Bit more understanding and a bit Kinder towards the people that we see on the street and I just wish we were because it is hard especially right now in Australia.	
1	It's like the middle of winter and it must be so cold out there and I feel so sorry for them.	
3	And I think the main point I'm trying to make is that we all need to be more grateful and appreciative of everything that we have in the support systems that we have as well. And we also need to plan for the future as well.	
1	Like we need to have you know, if If I had a been more adult when I was 19, I would have budgeted so I could save a lot more in case anything bad happened. So I could pay for rent or whatever if anything bad happened to me which I do now because I get worried that I'm going to get sick again. It can't work and I don't want my parents to have to pay for stuff again. So I have my emergency fund so I should actually change that.	
3	I feel like this life shirt lesson should be to have an emergency fund. And and be nicer to homeless people. I feel like that's that's what we should get out there. Yes. I just think being more grateful in turmoil. Also, just help your mental health. Anyway, like you cannot my favorite saying is you cannot be sad if you are grateful. That is the best thing because as soon as you're sad just sit down and think about all the little things that you take for granted every day and be great. Full of for them and you won't be sad anymore that like that is my wisdom that I'm giving to you.	
1	You're welcome.	
3	Okay moving on so that one was a bit heavy. This one is all about travel, right? Oh man traveling. It's a good time. This lesson. Is that travel grows you and changes you.	
1	I am a big one for people taking Gap years between high school and University. I am a big advocate for that because you know, even if you're a hundred percent sure on what you want to be when you're older and what you want to study in University taking a gap here and just taking some time to really figure yourself out is an amazing opportunity to either cement that passion and that idea of going to University and studying that one thing or it's going to show you another passion and you're like, oh no I want to actually explore that more than the other one. You know.	
3	I took a gap year in obviously after I graduated high school and I never got off it. I did go to UNI actually for a bit, but that didn't last long. Yeah. I took a gap year and I moved overseas and I lived in Italy in this tiny little Fishing town where barely anyone spoke English and I was a nanny for a two year old girl who is bilingual and oh my God, she was cute, but good Lord. Do not live with a two-year-old.	
1	If you can help it avoid them. Whoa. Yeah.	
3	I left Australia very immature and naive and just a mess. I was also coming out of	
1	a bit of a toxic relationship that I was then going to continue on for about two years on and off.	
3	But again, we'll talk about that one later and I went over there and I just had to grow up all of a sudden because I was in this town where no one was able to communicate with me.	
1	I had to find a way to communicate with them. I was with this random family that I met online doji is heck anyway, and I had to care for this little girl.	
3	She was my responsibility. I had to be an adult and actually look after her and I'm not saying that nannying is what did it I think it really is just being in a completely different country to your family and your normal support systems and being completely out of your comfort zone. That's what changes you and that's what makes you grow up. And when I came back I was a completely different person in my own head. I don't know if other people felt it but my perspective of things my ways of like dealing with	
1	Things and problem-solving and recognizing things like what's about like what's valuable to me?	
3	And what's not, you know that all changed and it pointed me and it was a pointed me in the direction of you know, what I want to do with the rest of my life. And then of course then I went overseas again and I changed once more and this is more because I was an idiot and I did some stupid stuff over there like For instance when I went to go to leave for Spain, I went to the airport got to the check-in desk and my the lady at the check-in desk took my passport and then she looked at the passport and then she looked up at me and she went Lucy. You're not leaving the country today and I was like what she's like.	
1	Yeah, you're not going anywhere. I was like, what do you mean my passport had expired?	
3	I had no idea no idea and it's so then a lot of Tears later and $500 later for an emergency passport and one week later that I didn't get to go into.	
1	My trip and also $1,600 later for the price rise in the plane seat. Oh and 2 and a 2 hour long phone call with Abu Dhabi. I was in Spain having a great time. But yeah, I traveling just made me go. Oh shit. I need to be an adult. I need to be the one to check my passport. Not my mum. Need to be the one to have this emergency fund, you know in my bank account. My mom's not shouldn't be telling me that and then this also ties in my with my next life lesson of being an adult but basically another thing that happened in Spain, I haven't really told this story to my parents. So I really hope my parents aren't listening. So I told them a story but I told them our version of this. Story, so when I was in Spain, I was in Ibiza and this is three days after I got there so had just gone through the whole passport Fiasco got to Spain and went on this boat party all my God. It was so good. That was like jet skis and I was like wasted it was so good. Anyway, we got off this boat party and we'd been drinking all day. So I was gone and we went to Chainsmokers at like this. Quote Aishwarya, and I was obviously having a great time my friend had the backpack with all of our wallets and phones and hostile keys in it. And then so she was looking after all day and at the concert as well and then I had found a friend we shall say a male friend and I took a liking to him and we were having a great time at the concert and then after the concert we all like My friend will call her Rachel. My friend. Rachel had also found a lovely male friend as well.	
3	And so we then decided to go out onto the beach at night time and run the day beds and she was with Rachel was with her male friend and I was with my male friend and I'm not saying I was doing anything but I was distracted and then I suddenly saw someone right beside my daybed.	
1	I look over and there's someone staring right at us and I was like that is creepy. That's not okay. And then he just gets up with the backpack that Rachel had given me to look after and just makes us like a run for it. And in that backpack is everything that we owned besides my passport. Oh my God, it's gone. I was fuming I sprinted after him. I couldn't find him anywhere. Cuz like I did he just I don't know where he went and I just went up and down the beach asking all these random people like did you see this guy with a backpack to do see this guy with the backpack? Anyway, then yeah, it was gone and that there's another part there's a whole other half of the story but I feel like that's not like there's no context.	
3	There's no reason for me to tell you that but the life lesson that I've learned there is to be more responsible and look after. I'm your things. Oh my God.	
1	I still don't know where my phone is. It is somewhere in a beta. Someone's got it having a great time same with my driver's license and that kind of ruined the about Ibiza trip because then we were in like the police station for hours and hours trying to you know, put down a lost of what it whatever it is.	
3	I think like a complaint another complaint like, you know, just the thing and we didn't have our hostel Keys as well.	
1	So We had to stay in other places, but that's me going into the story more. I need to not do that. But it's a great story. Anyway lesson 4 and 5 expose is that yes travel changes you and it matures you and it teaches you how to be an adult because you are faced with situations that you wouldn't usually come across in everyday life.	
3	Like I wouldn't usually come across that situation here in Australia because it is just such a safe place here like the other month.	
1	Week. No, I totally lied. It was like a year ago like last year. I was at the train station and those I saw this guy cross this station from me and he had this massive plasma TV, and he was like carrying it around and then he just likes at it on a bench seat and then went off into the office to go talk to some guy and like is just sitting there just as this is plasma TV and no one touched it no one pretended like they owned it so they could steal it and run away with it like nothing.	
3	It's just an amount of times as well that I've seen people just leave their wallet on the table to like save the table as they go off to go order something at the bar.	
1	Just they just leave that wallet there like it's fine just so just so they can save it. You know, it's Julia is such a safe place like I mean also it's not a safe place, but I just think it's a lot safer with belongings then some way like Ibiza or something like that.	
3	But yeah.	
1	There's my five. Well more like for life lessons.	
3	This is a very short recording. I feel as well because I don't have anyone to talk with me, but I'm doing a pretty good job of speaking to myself for the last 22 minutes, but I'm really excited for this podcast. I'm going to be doing more life lessons in the future because I just think I'm an idiot and I've learned some things and I need to share that with someone and I'm going to have heaps of people coming on here, and we're all going to talk.
