4	What it is what it is, it's still it is what the fuck Jim talk Boston, right? So and it's this isn't pre-roll don't skip it. It's not pre-roll. Alrighty probably heard that before this episode. I do want to go I want to jam just more because I know a lot of you aren't going to be able to go. I know some of you are planning on attending like I said, like I'm not bullshitting when I tell you guys it's got to be a small group because burden by Ray their Studio isn't huge so we can't have, you know, fucking 40 people in there or whatever it may be so, I know a lot of you guys can't go just Geographic take a cost stuff like that. But if you can like honestly I'm charging dick for this you really should go but if you're not able to let's just talk on something. I want you guys to understand something about the new funnel the first off I calling it new marketing funnel not because it's actually new but because I'm I don't think there's anyone else out there putting out the content of the workflow of how this needs to get done. Now the like I am, so it's new to us right brand spanking. Used right in that in that regard brand spanking used. It's stuff that's been around just like CrossFit in like a lot of these models were like Greg Glassman didn't invent the pull up the power clean the Burpee and running 400 meters the do just put that all together in a workout. That was just I mean fucking killer like and it just like it was like oh shit. So that's what happens when you put this stuff in the right order. That's what this is. Okay. So the new marketing funnel for those you guys who've been paying attention. It is a very wide. Top of funnel that is organic Outreach. Meaning you are putting on open houses for businesses resident communities fucking nursing homes. If you're one of those four gyms have a geriatric fucking thing teams. If you're one of those gyms have a youth sports kind of thing you are going ahead and going to local resident communities for you know, hangover breakfast has or coffees and bagels or stop by the front desk on the way out for a free week of fit. Like there's all these different plays rights finding coffee shop. That don't sell food and then you go and buy a bunch of bagels and set up shop outside the coffee shop and hand out free week of Fitness or a free intro class or a free consolo and grab a bagel and face. Fuck it like whatever and I know you guys are well, how do we how do I how do I communicate with the resident? What do I say? How do I get them to allow me to do that? That's not for this podcast first off fucking interpersonal communication skills people fucking just talk to people look them in the eyes. Say the shit that's in your brain filtered out of your fucking mouth hole and Get him do what you want our do say what you need to say to get what you want to get when you guys fucking ding me and you're like, yeah, but what do I say to an apartment complex to get them the fuck in? You know, let me do this like I don't know like I know what the fuck up fucking mental G-spot is on the random fucking, you know, Tina that you're going to talk to in the leasing office of your local resident Community. I don't fucking know like dude. I don't know like look and see what they've been doing lately. Anyway, I'm not going on that tangent. That's what that that's At the Boston Summer I'll be I'll be balls deep in their tangent on how to actually procure this but it starts with a big open organic. And then where the the Facebook ads stuff begins is immediately afterwards. A lot of people message me kind of wondering how it goes from this organic element down to a name email and phone number and the way it works is we will run paid branding awareness campaigns. These paid branding awareness campaigns are are going to be running at low dollar daily budgets and their goal is maximum links clicks to a link beneath a very cute specifically curated landing page, which I'll talk to you about not your website. Not your fucking website. Do not drive traffic to your website knock that shit off. It's going to you know, push views on a video. It's going to post engagement with a photo or a video one of these multiple objectives when you get into the back end. Facebook ads manager and you're going to do it at North you're going to do it for a very high volume generally 60 to 75 days now during the 60 to 75. You're going to generate a few leads, but that's not the goal of this 6 is 75 days, like you'll directly generate leads like again, if you get 200 people to click the link to your landing page and out of 200 to fill out your landing page give you their name email and phone number even though that wasn't the objective. The objective was just a Drive traffic to the landing page and if they jumped off, that's okay because the whole purpose of this is retargeting the reason we're driving traffic to a landing page or views to a video is to retarget a warm audience. So if you like stoop over the course of a you know, the 60 days I spent like whatever it is. I spent you know, two hundred three hundred dollars a month for two months and I didn't get that many leads. Yeah. I know fuck face because the whole purpose of it was not lead generation yet you're Blowing your load in the first round, homie. We're just trying to drive traffic. We're trying to figure out who's the least interested so we can retarget you guys have to understand the psychology of someone on Facebook doesn't go to Facebook to buy anything. Like well, why isn't anyone clicking on my head because they don't go to Facebook to buy stuff. You stupid. Fuck they go to Facebook to escape to see what their fucking friends are doing to see what their mom posted to see what Trump fucking posted. They're not going there to be one ever said in the history. Of your fucking world man. I really want to get a new pair of shoes. Let me go see what Facebook has to offer. It's not a Marketplace like that. It is a Marketplace for communication and sharing and we happen as advertisers to throw our ads in the way and hopefully they're entertaining and educational enough to grab someone's attention. So again those first 60 to 75 days, I'm going to teach you guys patience. I'm going to teach you exactly how to curate branding ads and how they are different in the copywriting and the medium in which you use so that people are learning about you being entertained by you and there's not too aggressive of a call to action yet the call to act the call to action to be very clear very concise, but we're not fucking you know, throwing that that you know that Yet so we do that for 60 to 75 days. We've got this nice fat audience. You know, the the one that did the best for urban movement is I get a video to up over 30,000 views in that period of time and that's not a budget of around five to ten dollars a day depending on what kind of different ad sets we were running but 30,000 views on this is all hyper local right? And if any of you guys by the way, I glitched I was editing some copy over the weekend and I fucked up and I did not I published an old ad set. It was just a generic like all over the country. And it was amazing the gym owners that came out the woodwork to let me know Stu Stu. I think you need to go check your ad and I see an urban movement ads in Texas for all you guys that did that. Thank you. So fucking much like we all fucking make mistakes. We all fucking fat finger something and like click the rot like it happens. I appreciate you guys, so I wasn't wasting money in dollars for people to see them fucking Nebraska. So again, thank you so much. Anyway, so that was, you know, getting that video of the 30,000 views was a killer because now we guess what happens when someone in Charlotte, North Carolina - he's a gym video with probably now 33 34 thousand views you stop. It's got clout. It's like followers. Your video is getting more views is like you and your Instagram page getting followers. It has more clout people give you more credit. You are more popular people. Don't get that Li you have to think like when you're on Facebook, do you fuckers ever stopped at a video that has two views? No you when you see somebody has fucking 500,000 views and 45 comments like oh shit. It's a party in there. Huh? Let's go. I'm gonna watch this and then see what the fuck's going on in the comments. Comment hacking is one thing. I'll sit Urban Movement we need to do way way way way way better at it is like I've see I've got gyms that execute on it better than I do. But comment hacking is definitely a strategy. I'll be speaking about at Boston for the one day business seminar on February 22nd. It's one of the things that just organically gives your ship virality. Uh, Virality locally and we'll talk more about that. But again going through this funnel see of the 60 to 75 days and then we go ahead and then we re Target and then we retard a little bit more specifically what we target those people maybe for another couple weeks on again landing page views. That's one of the options and objectives. You can utilize in Facebook ads manager and Instagram. So getting people to view the landing page go to the landing page again putting that bait right in front of their face and the majority of which are not going to purchase. We will do that again for another few weeks and then we go in for that big fucking right hook and that's where you pull out a really solid front end offer for us. It was our reset series 50% off four or eight week membership one or two months half off. It's a great fucking offer. My god, when someone's been paying attention to you and watching you and lurking and they've seen your shit and Senior shit and see your shit and you haven't been swinging like half off half off half off half off half off half a that. Like if they half off his now just who you are. You gotta then come in with the big front end offer and then they're able to go. I'm like, oh, I haven't seen it. Fuck. I gotta grab that if you've always half off and that's just what we call your Evergreen offer. You just got to realize won't pack as much of a punch. Like we'll end our 50% off promo here probably at the end of February because it's still killing right now. It's doing great. But you guys got to understand like these promotion in front of like if you do a free week, that's one thing like that can be at evergreed offer a strong promotion at the end of this new marketing funnel now coach you guys on his got to fucking show tits. It's got to be fucking like it is got to attract people if it's the same old shit. They're not going to swing for the fences on it and give you that name. Mail and phone number and really want to seize the opportunity due to a mindset of scarcity or whatever. It may be. I really I'm not gonna lie if your New York, Connecticut, Maryland fucking but Massachusetts fucking Pennsylvania anywhere around there.
