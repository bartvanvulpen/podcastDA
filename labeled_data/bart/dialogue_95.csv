1	This episode of the ortho bullets podcast will actually be a guest lecture about pediatric orthopedic infections from dr. David Bennett who is an assistant professor of pediatric orthopedic surgery at Phoenix Children's Hospital today. I would like to discuss pediatric orthopedic infections. I have no Financial disclosures or conflicts of interest. Although there are many facets of pediatric orthopedic infection today. We will be mainly focusing on septic arthritis osteomyelitis spine. Actions and piyo myositis pediatric septic arthritis is one of the most common and potentially dangerous diagnosis in pediatric Orthopedics. It is the most common type of pediatric orthopedic infection. Usually presenting between one month to 5 years of age half of the time. It's in children under age to 94% are single joint infections in the hip is the most common joint involved in children. Staph. Aureus is the most common and every age Influenza is common in six months to five year olds who have not undergone vaccinations and gonorrhea and kids over 10 years of age and gram-negative bacilli is common in immune deficiency and contamination. Staph aureus or pseudomonas is coming from puncture wounds strep. Pneumonia is coming from pneumonia and meningitis and other upper respiratory tract infections. Listeria or atypical mycobacteria can come from chronic infection or immune deficiency Group B strep can come from maternal.	
2	Inoculation of infant's pathogenesis is typically either direct or indirect inoculation hematogenous spread or spread through adjacent tissues are examples direct inoculation can also be from an aspiration or an arthropod of me or some sort of trauma gout or Rheumatic diseases.	
1	Do not eliminate the risk of septic arthritis and often are underlying and sometimes predisposing a careful history is very important because diabetes or immune deficiency or hematological diseases. Also predispose to septic arthritis hematogenous spread is the most common cause upper respiratory inner ear or dental infections are common causes for hematogenous spread.	
2	This is in part due to the vascular anatomy in a neonate the entire epiphysis shares a blood supply with the metaphysis and the impaction therefore can spread into the epiphysis and can produce devastating osteonecrosis of the proximal femur. However, after development of the secondary ossification, Asian Center the epiphysis and metaphysis have a separate blood supply thus in an older child the physis prevents the spread of infection to the epiphysis. However, the metathesis remains intra-articular and infection May decompress into the joint in the metaphysis the nutrient artery terminates and ends and arterioles which make a hairpin turn at Jason to the physis and feed into the larger Venus sinusoids this results in turbulence.	
1	Sludging and slowing down of the blood flow which can lead to deposition of the bacteria the hip ankle shoulder and elbow all have inner articular physis which predisposed to septic arthritis history and physical is most important part of your work up an experienced physical examination can be diagnostic.	
2	However fevers acute pain swelling of one joint tenderness warmth fusions or swelling severely limited range of motion pain with even the slightest motion.	
1	Ocean limp or inability to bear weight are vitally important to making the diagnosis a step wise and measured approach is very important to diagnosing septic arthritis begin with history and physical examination followed by Imaging blood work and join aspiration if indicated septic arthritis has a broad differential diagnosis and therefore requires very deliberate workup find out about recent infections immune Integrity nutritional status fevers history. Rama antibiotic Administration and the onset history on examination logrolling the leg looking at the resting position seeing if they can walk looking for fevers swelling tenderness and warmth can also be helpful Imaging including an x-ray ultrasound MRI and a bone scan can be useful and Labs such as ESR CRP CBC urinalysis and blood cultures can be helpful as well. If indicated an aspiration of the joy	
2	joint can be diagnostic on a CBC that elevated white cell count with a high percentage of neutrophils could be concerning elevated white cell count is more common and septic arthritis that it is and osteomyelitis and it helps you with leukemia rule out ESR takes three to five days to Peak and returns to normal within three weeks. It's not very reliable or reproducible, but it's part of the diagnostic criteria.	
1	It doesn't tend to elevate in response to trauma like CRP. Does C-reactive protein is the most sensitive and reliable measure its nonspecific but can help rule out serious bacterial infection 98% of a time when there's no other underlying diagnosis.	
2	It increases 1000-fold within six hours and Peaks within 24 to 50 hours which helps with more acute diagnosis and it tends to renormalize within 7 to 11 days. This is the standard way to monitor the response to treatment afterwards. Really if it's increasing in spite of treatment six point five times more likely to also have osteomyelitis CRP is a better independent predictor than ESR and if it is totally normal there is still a 13 percent chance of septic arthritis.	
1	This graph shows the relative elevations of the C-reactive protein and the ESR C-reactive protein is more sensitive and acute than the ESR and normalizes more quickly.	
2	The Coker criteria is a useful.	
1	Tool for predicting septic arthritis when patients have a fever over 38.5 refuse to bear weight have an ESR over 40 and a white cell count over 12,000. If all four of these factors are present there is a 93 to 99 point six percent risk of septic joint later studies further refined this criteria that there is a 99% chance of septic arthritis when the CR p is greater than 1 the temperature. Is greater than 37 degrees ESR is greater than 20 white cell count is over 11,000 and on radiographs. The joint space is greater than 2 millimeters. Even when your diagnostic suspicion is high always get a radiograph Ultra scenography with the comparison from the contralateral hip can be useful to tell if there is a hip effusion order of operation for Imaging always begins with x-ray followed by ultrasound and an MRI if it is indicated memorize should always be Considered and done with and without contrast many times there is concomitant osteomyelitis, but 60% of the time septic arthritis causes reactive bone that looks like osteomyelitis conversely osteomyelitis can cause a joint reactive effusion get an x-ray and possibly an ultrasound prior to an MRI and beware of using an MRI in the absence of a full clinical picture and laboratory workup.	
2	Join aspiration is the gold standard for diagnosis Interventional Radiology and musculoskeletal Radiology often will perform after an MRI under the same anesthesia.	
1	It's important to actually look at the characteristics of the aspirated fluid is a bloody as Imperial aunt is a colored and arthrogram can validate a negative aspirin and make sure that it was taken from the joint 50,000 or more white cell count with a high left shift high protein and low glucose can help be diagnostic. The Gram stain and culture can be negative and up to 18 to 70 percent of aspirants and does not rule out septic arthritis. This is an example of a fluoroscopic Lee guided hip aspiration always send your aspirant for Gram stain cell count cultures the cell count and synovial fluid findings can be helpful with septic arthritis in general. The gross appearance is opaque. The volume is 5 to 50 milliliters. It has low viscosity and total white cell count has over 50,000 with the left shift over 75% Antibiotic choices based on cultures and if the culture is negative, we start with the empiric antibiotics admit to the Pediatric team suggest an infectious disease consult to help decide whether PICC line or orals is needed four to six weeks of antibiotics is indicated in the ESR can be helpful to determine the duration of treatment. Once the diagnosis is made surgery is indicated hold the antibiotics until the or after the cultures are sent unless the patient is septic. Drain is always used Penrose or ahima vac can be used and we plan a second irrigation and debridement and then cancel it depending on the CRP and fevers as well as the clinical examination after the first surgery.	
2	This is an overview of the previously mentioned Diagnostic and treatment algorithm for septic arthritis.	
1	Complications of septic arthritis whether it is treated or not include things like sepsis death avascular necrosis growth arrest stiffness of the joint persistent infection osteomyelitis, and these can be avoided potentially by treating early monitoring the CRP and getting an MRI pediatric osteomyelitis is less common than septic arthritis. Osteomyelitis is classified by Time acute Subacute and chronic and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis are the four different types. They are classified by the time periods above physical examination can be compounding in this population. The symptoms are not as obvious as with septic arthritis.	
2	It tends to be less painful and the symptoms are less severe there is pain and tenderness as well as warmth. There is swelling but it is not so severe that the patient is unable to walk sometimes. The laboratory workup is not different from septic arthritis with CBC and differential ESR and CRP. The CRP is elevated in ninety-eight percent of these patients. However, blood cultures can be negative and up to 70% of these patient much like septic arthritis. Hematogenous spread is the most common route radiographs are almost always useful to help you rule out other diagnosis such as lytic or school. Roddick lesions, however, the X-ray may be negative until day 10 to 14 after the onset of infection lesions are typically only visible in the bone on radiographs after loss of 30 to 50% of the bone density there may or may not be soft tissue swelling on radiographs loss of normal tissue planes. There may be widening of the joint space secondary to a reactive effusion comparison views are almost always very helpful in these.	
1	Aces MRI is more sensitive than a bone scan and a subperiosteal abscess found on MRI may be helpful as well. Pie-o-my Osiris may also be a parent as well as septic arthritis.	
2	There can also be septic dvts an MRI with and without contrast is indicated in these cases septic arthritis can cause reactive bone that looks like osteomyelitis and chronic osteomyelitis often looks like avascular necrosis on an MRI of note you may also have a joint effusion without septic arthritis secondary to a reactive effusion bone aspiration by Interventional Radiology can be diagnostic but is only positive 67 to 93 percent of the time and potentially less and younger children always keep the potential differential diagnosis on your radar, especially trauma where the CRP can be elevated but not the ESR and the pain usually leaves after 36 to	
1	48 Hours acute osteomyelitis is most common in the metaphysis in the of the femur. 75% is in the long bones a study of six hundred and fifty Seven children in 1997 revealed that the most common site of osteomyelitis is the femur 27 percent of the time it comes about because of transient bacteremia, upper respiratory tract infections and bacterial can seat via nutrient arteries. The metaphyseal vessels have endothelial gaps that allow bacteria to infiltrate into bone local tissue trauma can kick off this Cascade the primary spongy Osa is relatively a cellular and kids and it's vulnerable to staph aureus staph aureus adheres to type 1 collagen and endotoxins suppress the local immune response macrophages and monocytes then fight in the prostaglandin E1 creases and it contributes to the formation of What's called the sequester. Sturm inflammatory cytokines cause Beaver pain and lethargy the Mainstay of treatment is antibiotic therapy empiric is a broad-spectrum antibiotic blood cultures can also help to give an organism and a higher dose of antibiotics might be required for some organisms for those organisms consider a PICC line admit to Pediatrics and have them consult ID as well for antibiotic route Administration choice and for selection of the correct. Guess well, as outpatient follow-up surgery is indicated. Generally when an MRI shows us a questrom failure of antibiotic therapy is another indication a biopsy might give you a specific organism when the antibiotics fail, but even when it's decompress and drained 17% of these can develop chronic osteomyelitis the abscess forms in the bone at Dave four to five. So you treat early within 1-2 few days of symptom onset 12% of operatively treated and osteomyelitis go on to Chronic from acute versus 4% in non-op be especially careful to treat operatively osteomyelitis that is found to be in the femoral head as it tends to go on to become a septic hip complications include conversion to Chronic osteomyelitis avascular necrosis growth arrest deep Venous Thrombosis, which can be septic PE sepsis septic arthritis.	
2	itís endocarditis or pathologic fracture conversion to Chronic osteomyelitis is related to the length of antibiotic treatment and three weeks or more has been shown to be better growth the rest becomes apparent around age 9 typically Brody in 1836 described Subacute osteomyelitis. It was difficult In Too Deep because it was less obvious with milder symptoms very slow and Insidious onset usually two weeks before the symptoms the patient had the infection normal labs, and it looks like neoplasia and about half of the patients.	
1	The diagnosis can take three to five months on average, but an MRI with and without contrast has helped home.	
2	Half of osteomyelitis diagnosis or Subacute in nature. They're often culture negative positive cultures are only found in 2090 61 percent of the patients. Staph. Aureus is the most common organism. It is more diverse and it's locations than acute more diaphysis eel and epiphyseal and is found to be an older kids as well. The pathophysiology of Subacute osteomyelitis is more related to an altered host-pathogen response. There's usually a A lower virulent bacteria administration of the wrong antibiotics or for other infections and sometimes this one looks like cancer the workup is the same as septic arthritis and other types of osteomyelitis, but sometimes you will need a contrasted CT to help identify the lesion.	
1	Plan for a biopsy with ortho oncology involved in the decision to move forward. Chronic, osteomyelitis usually comes from a cute hematogenous. Osteomyelitis causes avascular necrosis. Staph. Aureus is the most common organism and the tibia is the most common site these can develop into subperiosteal abscess. He's and deprives the bone of the periosteum blood supply staph aureus binds to the Bone and can survive inside of osteoblasts. So question of Dead Infected bone can develop and involucre mmm. Is reactive new bone and that can also develop however sequester Ms. An operative indication where as an involute room is not necessarily antibiotic choice is usually Guided by infectious disease, but refampin is a reasonable item biotic choice to start with empiric treatment six to nine months of antibiotics might be required close monitoring particularly of the ESR. And CRP is needed surgery is almost always needed for these during surgery a thorough.	
2	Ocean and debridement is important pmma and antibiotic beads can be used and then switched out every four to six weeks as well as a PICC line or oral antibiotics depending on the Infectious Disease Rex involucre. Mm is a good sign that the bone will live. The most common complication is recurrence in 20 to 30 percent of patients calcaneal. Osteomyelitis is a specific entity. It can destroy the Apostle plate but there is a 92% curate if you get treating it within 48 hours over five days to beginning treatment 75% of the time you end up needing surgery operate when you have a sequester mm or failed IV antibiotics pediatric spine infections have a similar approach. Spine infections represent only one to two percent of all osteomyelitis vertebral body osteomyelitis, very similar to disc guide this except for the disc itís is usually under age seven point five and the fevers are lower than osteomyelitis, but they do have severe back pain evaluation and treatment of vertebral body. Osteomyelitis is the same as with this guide us in children L 3 4 and 5 of the most common levels affected right vertebral body osteomyelitis. Staph aureus is the most common organism vessels from the vertebral body in plate to the discs are confluent up till age 7 so often if you have vertebral body osteomyelitis, you'll have an adjacent disc itís cultures are only 30 to 50 percent positive IV antibiotics gives the lowest recurrence rate average diagnostic delays. Approximately two months to treatment the workup and treatment is is in general the same as with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. However aspects can can be done for equivocal cases before you turn to an MRI eventual MRI is diagnostic with the sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 93% empiric treatment is usually against deaf Aureus but blood cultures will guide treatment biopsy by our can be done with CT guidance antibiotics for 6 weeks to 6 months thereafter it Be done brace can help with pain in the short term long term.	
1	We see persistent disk space narrowing back pain with extension and 85% of patients persist long term intervertebral Fusion can also be a long-term consequence of severe infections.	
2	The mortality rate for necrotizing fasciitis can be as high as 73 percent intervention. However, within four days increases their Survival by 12% diagnosis is clinical and lab base, but an MRI I can also be helpful periodically bowl a skin necrosis crepitus refractory treatment antibiotics fast progression septic shock can be helpful as well as using scoring systems to make the diagnosis surgery within 24 hours of admission is the only variable that has been shown to affect mortality 93 percent survival of surgery is done within that first 24-hour period 75 percent survival of surgery is completed within four.	
1	Eight hours of admission the two most important things to know about necrotizing fasciitis or number one has a potential to be fatal. If not treated quickly. The average cumulative mortality is 33% but up to seventy six percent mortality for this has been unchanged since the 1920s and number two. The only Factor consistently proven to reduce mortality is rapid surgical debridement 93 percent of patients receiving surgery than 24 hours, sir. Survive, this is an infection not only of the faccia but also of the underlying muscle there is excessive pain swelling and bullion the skin most commonly, it's group a C and G strep cluster Dia MRSA or it can be polymicrobial treatment is emergent surgery as previously mentioned as well as IV antibiotics.	
2	The lri, next score is a lab based scoring system that can be used to help. Whittle down the diagnosis somewhat often.	
1	There is a proceeding trauma and one muscle group is involved quadriceps muscle is the most common group followed by the iliopsoas in the glute muscles staff and Group B strep at the most common pathogens.	
2	The spreader piyo myositis is usually hematogenous skeletal muscle does having some intrinsic resistance to bacterial infection unless it's traumatized parasites can often be causative and its	
1	Shader with underlying causes such as immune compromised cancer diabetes and HIV MRI with and without contrast is usually diagnostic on MRI the thickness of the rim of Micra abscess predicts a response to antibiotics alone without surgery MRI guides the surgical approach as well the typical empiric treatment for piyo myositis is clindamycin for about four to six weeks. Interventional Radiology can usually drain these with the ct-guided aspiration surgery is indicated for small loculated abscess. He's with thick rims on the MRI surgery is also for patients at risk for septic shock pie-o-my. Oh situs when it is a strep infection can be very aggressive locally. It can also be fatal systemically mortality rate can be as high as 80% was strep pile - itís septic bursitis is typically a clinical diagnosis usually aspirate if you're not sure if it's septic, but be careful to do its tearily and MRI can also be used if you're not sure if it's bursitis or if there's an overlying cellulitis septic bursitis usually involves swelling erythema pain with flexion boggy Bursa tenderness to palpation, but range of motion can be intact except for at the terminal points of flexion extension the most common Pathak Jen is staph aureus the treatment is with nafs' Eleanor oxacillin for em, MRSA you can use clinda or Vancomycin subject bursitis is treated with irrigation and debridement if needed bactrim or clindamycin antibiotics for MRSA.
