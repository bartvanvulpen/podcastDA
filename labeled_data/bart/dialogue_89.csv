2	What's up guys? And welcome to the up nor trip. I'm your host Sean Lawson and I almost forgot the title to my podcast just there. So bear with me today is the very first episode of the up north trip. I'm hella excited and I appreciate you guys coming in and tuning in and supporting me those to my friends that are tuning in right now. Thank you guys. I appreciate the support and this podcast is Going to be about sports. I'm a big fan of the NFL the NBA casual fan of the NHL. I'm a Montreal Canadiens fan and I live in Canada. So we're all about hockey here. And the point of this podcast is to bring a voice to the fans out here of the NFL because me and my friends all we talk about sports. Pretty much all the time every day of the week sending each other the latest news and voicing our opinions on it. So this is the point of this podcast that I really wanted to start and give my voice give Canada voice about the NFL and the NBA because the NBA out here for the nation as a whole is on the rise. We have more players. Getting drafted into the NBA from Canada more players getting scouted by the NCAA to join their college teams and all in all more more fans branching out to Toronto Raptors and joining other teams fan bases Across America. So yeah, it's to give a voice to Predominantly more the NFL this is going to be a NFL podcast because that's what I love talking about. Primarily. I'm more of a casual fan also to the NBA but I've been taking more of an interest recently in recent years. So I'm a box fan Milwaukee Bucks fan and I was heartbroken but also kind of happy to see the Raptors make the finals and eventually when especially against the Golden State, Or yours last year, but I am a box fan because of the Greek Freak yanis. He's just a beast and I love them. I'm more of a player kind of fan of the NBA, but I'm also a huge Westbrook fan Russell Westbrook, and I'm excited to see him in Houston this year. It's going to be very weird not seeing him in those blue and orange colors formerly of the Oklahoma City Thunder. This year is going to be crazy for the NBA and I'm kind of excited but not as excited as I am for the NFL kicking off September 5th bears-packers. I'm a huge Green Bay Packers fans fan. Sorry as some of my friends do know and if you check out my Twitter at Sean Lawson UNT, I am a huge Packer supporter. I'm on there every day talking about Packers. Talking about the latest news also voicing my opinions on the rest of the league. So give me a follow get at me. Also tweet me on just talk shit. If you want to just give me absolute Greece and talk shit. But if you just want to talk football and have a good conversation about your team. Go ahead tweet at me follow make sure to follow and we'll have some conversations on there. And maybe give me some ideas for the podcast if you want some segments. I'm going to be coming up with some segments shortly. My brother is producing an intro song and potentially an outro. I don't know if I am if I'm feeling about an outro song, but definitely he's cooking up something special for me, and I'm excited this podcast is going to grow. With drops and sound bites. So bear with me it's all a process. I'm nervous. So that's why I'm you know stuttering and this that and the third and probably saying um too much but it's a process and I can't I can't wait to keep this thing going and interacting with people who I may not know and you know, some of my friends giving me shit about what I say on here. So yeah. I'm excited and let's keep this going so I talked about my fan bases of who I'm a fanatic of and yeah, that's about it for now and we're going to move onto some news for the day. So today August 29th is they last week four preseason know I would be surprised if I saw any starters out out there unless they are. You know, maybe rookies who need to get some last needed reps in for their respective teams, but don't don't be surprised if you don't see anybody out there of Star Quality unless it's your look he's trying to give their coaches some last-minute Impressions. And for the rest of the guys that maybe you know need that last needed shine to show their coaches that they're worth it. And make the final 53-man roster because this is that essentially the last opportunity for many of them and I'm excited. I'm going to be tuning into the Chiefs Packers game at ap8. Yeah, 8:00 p.m. And definitely going to be keep my eyes peeled for who's going to make it for us. I know we have a couple Rising Stars. Shepherd this guy's a beast. I want to see the QB the second string QB and the who's going to be the third string QB Tim Boyle and Deshawn Kaiser right now have been dueling it out for that QB to spot for the Packers. So that's that's what I'm going to be looking out for tonight with my game that I'm watching. Let me know on Twitter what you guys are going to be watching tonight if if you do watch. So, yeah, also also, I forgot to mention Trevor Davis. It's guy last last week in Winnipeg bawled out. I think he had like nine receptions 400 hundred plus yards. This guy was all over the field and he he shocked me he really did. So I'm excited to see what he can do. I know the wide receiver competition for Green Bay lot of young guys. So it's gonna be it's gonna be tough to break that 53-man roster and I'm curious to see how many Wide receivers will make the final roster. So yeah, that's that's what I'm going to be looking forward to tonight. Let me know. Let me know on Twitter what you guys are looking at and yeah moving forward. Houston Texans outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney continues to hold out from the Texans and a potential trade kind of like what Khalil Mack did last season for the Raiders. He jumped ship. Well, he didn't really jump ship. He got traded to the Bears huge huge move for the Bears and also for the Raiders they got a they got a couple picks out of hello Mac, but definitely made that. Defense scary for the Bears last season and will probably make it scary this year for them, but Clowney nonetheless. Could be on some trade rumors. I know of five teams that have shown strong interest in the talents of Clowney the Dolphins entering as the favorites other other teams joining them are the Philadelphia Eagles the Seattle Seahawks the Washington Redskins and the New York Jets and in my opinion. Any NFL team would love the talents of Jadeveon Clowney, but I'm keeping my eyes peeled really a team that jumped out for me is the New York Jets just because you know, they use the first round draft pick for Quintin Williams. And if you had Jadeveon Clowney to the mix That's scary that young Brooke is a beast. I saw some of his highlights from the preseason. He's a bowl out there. And if you're going to add Jadeveon Clowney to the Jets, yo, I'm telling you that's going to be dangerous that's going to be dangerous for the AFC East and finally maybe some competition. I'm not necessarily saying that they would Dethrone the Patriots, but definitely giving them. Some competition like back in the day when the Rex Ryan years. It was the last time really where that division was up for not up for grabs. But you know the last time we had real competition so, you know, I'm pulling for the Jets. It's probably rumors. But listen, if out of those five teams, I would love to see Clowney go to the Jets. In other news defensive end Ryan Russell from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers made news today made headlines today. He's an NFL vet. And today he came out with a personal essay. I don't know where it was published. But nonetheless it came out quote. My truth is that I'm a talented football player a damn good writer a loving son and overbearing brother a caring friend a loyal lover and a bisexual men. Definitely making some headlines in the NFL where this is a first for sure definitely could cause some controversy but nonetheless kudos to you Ryan Russell. It takes a lot of frickin balls to do that. And who knows maybe may be looked upon as a role model role model. Sorry to some of the kids who are bisexual.	
1	or gay	
2	In college or High School playing football or just in general? If you're part of the lgbtq community great great story. I actually I actually really do like that story out of Tampa Bay. In other news Lakers Center DeMarcus Cousins has made some poor headlines today on Tuesday. TMZ reported cousins was under investigation. By mobile Alabama's police for allegedly threatening to kill an ex-girlfriend of his in a recording released by TMZ a man tells a woman that he will put a bullet through her fucking head. Wow Savage and I could swear on here because this is a podcast. So yeah, that's that's pretty that's pretty serious business right there. After she tells the man that their son cannot attend his upcoming wedding cousins ex-girlfriend told TMZ that the man on the recording is in fact DeMarcus Cousins. So not a good look for cousins. Not a good month of August if you're counting in the injury for Boogie cousins. This is a this is not what you want to see if you're a Lakers fan on top of the news coming out of his camp that he Tore his MCL or ACL. I forget which tenant was in his knee. But this is this is unfortunate to say the least. And hopefully Boogie cousins this isn't true. I actually do like bogie cousins. I like his asshole mentality because he's just a straight shot at Savage. Sorry, but yeah, nonetheless, he he's a stud. I hope he can finally get back next year and play a full regular season because the man gets boards board man gets paid. As Kawhi Leonard would say so hopefully this isn't true and hopefully he stays out of trouble for the rest of the 2019 2020 season more NFL news New England Patriots bring in some offensive line help they get a trade from I believe the Baltimore Ravens they signed boy. I forgot his name, but they They signed a defensive lineman out of Baltimore and unfortunately for them, they're starting center. I saw earlier this week developed blood clots in his lungs. So definitely trying to help boost the offensive line. Hopefully this kid is a stud because they're going to need it. And in other news zika still holding out no surprise there. Let's just let's just get this deal done. Come on. It's time it's time Jerry Jones. I got two NFL fantasy drafts coming up this weekend, and I would love to have Zeke signed ready to roll or any to get drafted because right now it's causing turmoil when you when you're talking fantasy football. Because you know, you know in a lot of leagues, maybe you're not sure if you want to bite on them. You don't know if it's going to be a whole other Le'Veon Bell situation. And you might not bite when he when he falls to you if in the top top first round of your NFL drafts or you might you might take the risk and then you're stuck with them all season if he doesn't play so in fantasy terms, I might that might suck. I know I got Fantasy on the brain, but you know, just just as a team as a whole listen Zeke Zeke, is that offense. Zeke is what that is what makes that offense successful. It's what makes it Thrive because clearly he is the offense Dak Prescott is not going to take you to the Super Bowl. I am sorry. I am not a Dak Prescott fan. I think he is trash. He's not a good QB and you could get at me on Twitter if you want, but I am not Dak Prescott Fab. He's trash and he's not going to take it to the playoffs. But what's around him might that offensive line is serious. Amari Cooper is good. I know they have a couple good rookies as well. And I know I know they say, you know, Tony palardy no joke, you might be a James Conner. Listen, man. You need Zeke Tony Pollard is not Zeke. Let's get this thing going Jerry Jones signs the Elliott so we could have a successful season and you know if we're talking about Super Bowl favorites. We're talking about the Patriots but in the NFC, you know, maybe the Saints Rams Eagles. Dallas man Dallas is good this year, but they won't be as good without Zeke telling you man. Get this deal done. We also have my guy Melvin Gordon still holding out pairing. There's no contract. There's no contract talks right now that it's in a stalemate. It's not it's not going well for either sides. They're fighting over a 2 mil to 3 mil price range of difference between an offer and what Gordon wants and you know, I hate holdouts. It's it sucks. It really does, you know for for all the fan bases for all the people who love these guys. For fans of each running back was holding out right now. It sucks. And you know, you want to see everyone playing at the start of a great NFL season, especially the iconic hundredth season of the NFL. It's time to get these guys signed. Come on now. It's time to bite. I know the Chargers are a little bit more off. I would say in the terms of who's backing them up. Austin Eckler is good because Gordon was out a few games last season and Austin Austin Eckler came in and showed the rest of his coaching staff and upper management that listen. I could do this job put me in coach. Let's get this thing rolling and you know, they want they want to few games with Austin at Eckler in the backfield. So but nonetheless, I want my guy Melvin Gordon signed Wisconsin boy, so let's get this deal done. Let's get Zeke done. Let's get every other person that's holding out in the NFL right now done. We don't need another Le'Veon Bell situation and one more thing I would like to add about	
1	The Cowboys and Zeke.	
2	This is essentially an Emmitt Smith 2.0. You know, even if we're not regardless, but hypothetically speaking. If this if this hold out runs to let's say a week for week three kind of what happened to Emmett Smith and Jerry Jones was like well, we're one and two or were owned three. All right Zeke come on in. Let's just put that in the what kill that thing. We don't even want to talk about it. Just stop we want this thing done. You guys have an easy schedule to start. I think they play the Dolphins the Science Redskins in the first three weeks of the NFL and listen if you have seek those are blue potentially blowout wins with no Alex Smith for the Redskins because of that gruesome leg injury last season. They signed Case Keenum Case Keenum is a bum. Dwayne Haskins hasn't proved to his coaching staff that he knows the ropes of this offense. So that are skeptical on starting him. So any look, I'm good for that week against the Cowboys got the Giants. Listen Giants are going to be trash. They have like four receipt wide receivers right now or injured and you got Eli Manning throwing the ball right now washed up. Ain't looking good. I know I'm typing up the Dallas Cowboys right now. I'm not a fan of the Cowboys. But nonetheless you got an easy schedule and you need to get this deal done Pronto. Well, that's that's it for the news for today little short and sweet episode here at the up north trip. But like I said, it's the first episode. I just wanted to get this thing running on to get this thing going practice practice makes perfect. So thanks to everyone. Who tuned in today? I really appreciate it. I know it was a little rocky maybe a little hard to listen to but at the end of the day, I really appreciate you guys for tuning in and I'll see you next week. I'm going to be doing probably an episode a week, you know to get this thing going. I don't want to set the bar high on the set the bar low, you know, get some practice really utilize the the program's I'm using for my podcast and Hopefully just get better get better soon. Like I said earlier in the podcast get some drops. Get some intro music get some sound bites get some segments, and it's a process here. So thanks again, and we'll see you next week.
