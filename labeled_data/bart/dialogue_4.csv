1	Hello, everybody. Welcome to episode 29 have been a good student this episode. It's just me Luke as Ross is currently awaiting corner on a family retreat, but I'm sure he'll be returning for our next episode. So as always one of the aims of the naked student podcast. East well, we want to offer a straight back approach to student life and to also discuss the problems that face all young people usually Ross and say Here's a little bit as well. But unfortunately we're gonna have to do without this week. I want to get at share our Instagram handle the naked student under school so easy to remember and probably the best medium through which to connect with us, but also rather excitingly we have set up a Account as well. So you can find us on Twitter at Capital TNS underscore podcasts. Usually on our Twitter. We like to share articles that sort of follow on from the discussions that we've had. So it's a good place to go and do further research if you will then finally, I just want to plug as well that Ross and I are doing a little cheeky movember as well. So you can keep up to date with all members on RAM and laugh at our feeble attempts at growing facial hair, but it's for a fantastic cause and we really hope that a lot of you donate to it because man's health is very important and especially men's mental health. I feel just still hasn't spoken about enough. So any donations would be greatly appreciated. So for episode 29, we have an interview for you guys today. We have a very special interview today. I'm joined by Sam from his bedroom in London. How are you doing Sam?	
2	I'm very well.	
1	Thank you for finding the time to come on. I know it's it's actually eight o'clock at night right now. And you been you're a busy working man now aren't you?	
2	It's a catch there with you mate. So she spread the gospel to these unwitting misters.	
1	Yeah. Well, you know, it's gonna be a very insightful episode. I'm sure as always I just want to outline what We're going to talk about briefly. So for the first half today, I want to start with joining a new school when you are aged 15, and then I want to just delve into the the academic side. You know, you're a very intelligent man. You've always attained incredibly High grades and I just want to explore. Yeah that I do if I could demux and the science and maths Roots, especially a lot of people are put off by signs of mass if they don't get it. So I just want to sort of explore if you do just get it or if there's a lot of hard work that goes on behind the scenes then I also want to talk about the mentality that you forged from quite a young age that idea of being quite driven and feeling like you have a purpose as well. And then also just talking about your time at Cambridge quite briefly and if it really is you know as we all believe in maybe what you have to sacrifice may be associated. Social life another interesting social myths like that as well after a pointless fact, I'd like to just delve into the more personal events that you've had to deal with over the last year. I won't give too much away on that just now, but that will lead on quite nicely from the first section about mindset and purpose and then to finish it off. It'd be To talk about working life as we've just touched upon. So how does that sound some?	
2	I was all good lead the way.	
1	Alright. So without further Ado then you join the new school aged 15, I believe and that can be quite a challenge. Did you find it hard to settle into a new school?	
2	It's a good question. I think. The boys NGS were really good to me within a couple of weeks a lot of friends and to be honest playing sport help massively with that, you know the environment that sport provides a lot of friends that you can rely on and just a great way to meet new people. So I think sport certainly is my path in getting a lot of fans that which yeah, and I think that's something that has been prevalent throughout my life. You know, the number of friends you have some team sports is just	
1	Believable completely agree with you. I think that's something that we actually covered on we covered saying that in the last podcast in see that we did it was about the importance of team sports and how it gives you an out from school. Almost would you agree with that?	
2	Yeah, definitely definitely is it's an Escape. I mean you formed friendships that you can't form during a customer list. Your teacher doesn't want you to be for my friendships. You know, he talking is it really the main thing they supposed to be doing but yeah, and I can speak today is about the source deposit is exercise and everything like that. So no sport was supposed massive one and I also The academic side of things that I'm Jess was was lovely it was competitive and you know, I thrived on that I think at my old school it was sort of if you did well because a nerd whereas if and yes issue if you're maybe even a test to be calling you stupid, you know, so that was just a different way of looking at things that just made it a lot easier for someone who is interested in the work to get on with it.	
1	Have you always been academically driven would you say you know, was it an independent driver? Was it more of a parental push if you will there was certainly No Parental person.	
2	I mean, I'm pretty sure anyone would be able to set it so that if they never parents, so yeah, I guess. Drive my even not be the right word. I was always just interested. You know, I'd read some pleasure and I love the subjects that I did at least at a level and most of them at GCSE. But yeah that that makes it so much easier to do to work when you're actually interested in it.	
1	So, yeah, I guess that that interest with certainly personal and so your a-levels you just said you enjoyed the subjects you did. Could you just go into More detail about what subjects you actually did.	
2	Yeah, of course so slit is just see I was when I was choosing my levels, I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do because I had a real strong interest in languages. I did must I did French not always Russian Latin at GCC because I love them. I found them they made sense to me and I enjoyed learning by the other cultures and then I also did sort of the three Sciences. So there's always that choice for me. Which tool path I was going to go down and in the end I opted for Russian math biology and chemistry and and yeah, it was just a case of I fell in love with Russian culture with the literature with a great teacher and a great group of mates doing it and science as well science was always me summarize found fascinating and I think like foremost sixteen-year-old scientists. I was a proper geek it's a sort of you as the only thing that mattered Most of them aligned of any artistic interests but ya know starts that was my choice to ended up doing those eight levels.	
1	So just on something I mentioned just at the start in the overview this science and maths route is it was very popular Manchester grammar, but something that's always a hit over here. I think quite a lot is when you're really smart in that science and math see Sands people say you just get it, you know. Why don't they just get it? You know, but I want to know is this true? You know, how much work goes into that side, even if you have a high cognitive or mathematic ability.	
2	Yeah, I think it's always going to be a balance right and for me, that's probably why you wanna help I did find I did find the science is quite easy. Everything made it everything made sense to me and I could work things out from first principles based on that I guess but that doesn't mean you're going to pass exams or do well just Not you know it meant I had to do perhaps last revision and instead I could just sit down and do 3 plus pages today. So undoubtedly, the understanding I think that can be linked to whether you whether it clicks or not. I know I'm Les I'm far worse at sort of history geography and that sort of side of things. But when it comes to up to Resource, it's obviously just hard work. Right like there's no substitute for that. You can't do well with are putting in the hours and I think yeah for sure for sure the actually the comprehension might be easier for me than it was for some people but when it comes down to getting results, if you put in five times as many hours you can care about a great so yeah, I think it's a mixture.	
1	No, I think that's that's really well put I suppose. I just wanted to ask that from the sense of I'd overheard that a lot. But also, you know, I went The humongous man very true. But you know, I did the history room, you know, I'm an essay writer. So I find it interesting. You know, I was I was okay at maths, but I didn't find it natural. So I it's I'm always interested when people are naturally maybe pick it up quicker and what that is like a really firm us.	
2	I mean, that's the best example that you can be taught a particular type of calculation, but realistically you have to do just 34th that's why masses just worksheets because it's just about doing repetitions of dislikes areas of it and learning the different ones and that's how you get good so much as a really good example of where hard work just	
1	Do you think that you know achieving very high grades did you that comes with its own pressure being academically gifted? I want to say.	
2	I think that's So precious for me I never did he felt pressure in the same way, I guess and this is interesting. This is some links into the mindset stuff that we're going to talk about I guess but for me pressure comes from other people's expectations on you and what you attribute to them what the significance you a tribute to someone else's opinion of you and I think that it is itself is problematic. You can't obtain your happiness and Security based on what other people think of you so for me Yeah, I I would do well and I want to do well for myself, but if I didn't do well, you know, and so when I felt like someone was judging me and us that doesn't happen. I don't necessarily get bothered by other people's opinion. And obviously that's that's the sort of Ideal a strike two, sometimes it does happen. But I think yeah, that's ultimately I don't listen to other people's opinions whether that's pressure on what I should be doing with my life or pressure on or you know, he needs to be working hard. I thought Sam was collaboration got a better grade that sort of thing. I think is the harmful process to get into when you start listening to pressure.	
1	Definitely. So I mean, I think it's quite interesting there that you say you don't listen to other people's opinion as such as that means something that's defined as you've got older as you become more aware of who you are or is that something that you've always sort of had as a part of your psyche.	
2	Yeah, I think I mean I do listen to people's opinion if they're telling me I'm doing something wrong what's going on. But yeah when it comes to expectations and sort of social influence, I think it's very important to carve your own identity. And that is something that to be honest. I didn't haven't slowed. Yeah. No, it's a gradual process and I think I matured a lot since I was about 17, I think it's sort of maybe since then, but yeah, there's just through Reading and we're friends with I think. Very short themselves. They have their own identity. I think sort of rubs off on me. And yeah, you know as a great American essays call Ralph Waldo Emerson, he's got a great essay on self-reliance and stuff like that, you know reading it it just sort of gave me this idea that you've got to lift yourself and you can't do one of the people want you to do if you don't think for yourself and be who you want to be	
1	Then there's not really much else that you can do in this world other than be yourself, you know, so yeah just want to touch on that because I think it's incredibly hard at present to to gain that sort of mentality of not really caring too much what most other people think in a world where you know, you can see so much of what other people are doing on social media all of these issues. It can be very difficult to block as a group grow or pick and choose. You want to listen to but would you say that just sort of reading a lot is a great starting point if you want to try and build this mentality that you have.	
2	Yeah, I think I got a lot of my ideas from Reading literature these ideas about having your own identity around values and suppose this is stuff that you see on Instagram is motivational quotes about. Yeah, but actually there is there is wisdom. That is just whether you believe it. I don't think I was very lucky that I had friends that supported me out of family that sort of supported me setup could do what I want and let me be who I want to be in stuff. So that's certainly a great Foundation. I had as an adult was privileged. I think it's news being exposed to those ideas in the first place and thinking about them. Logically, it was yeah, it's only just became a sort of realization actually. Yeah, there's nothing else that I can do with be myself and carve out the identities to me, but it's never too late.	
1	Is it to start just because you didn't do it when you were younger doesn't mean you can't do it immediately after listening to this for example hundreds and I think you don't need	
2	Disasters you don't need a slap in the face to make to make that realization, you know, you can just change you don't need to wait for some catastrophe to make you realize that you've been living your life the wrong way or whatever. I think I think it's a lot easier if you sort of get that identity early on, you know, and yes social media doesn't help my life. I think it's comes pretty toxic when it comes to that sort of thing. And a lot of reality it is the exact same. But yeah, I think it's a really good point that you can just sort of get up. Make that change gradually gradually.	
1	That's the thing. It doesn't happen overnight. So we try and get across quite a lot in our interviews, you know with you know with people who talk about the mentality side of things. You don't wake up and everything changes you do it for months you grind. That's what they would say don't hear so that's you know, really interesting that I think you should you sort of said that you know, because that's what Dylan one of our interviews he was saying very similar thing as well.	
2	Yeah, I think Lucas is somehow she would Thoughts about before but for me that came from having that sort of and we'll talk about it later, but having that. personal sort of Mantra I literally wrote down to five ten things that I found in reading or I'd heard and I wrote those down matter to me and I'd read them every day in the morning. And that would be how I reminded myself on a daily basis how I wanted to live and who I wanted to be and I think that That is almost the way that I did it sort of, you know getting into those good habits. It's as simple as you know, because people can listen to the podcast and hopefully there will be inspired and think yeah, you know I want to do I want to live that way but enacting that excuse me that on a day-to-day basis, that's the real tough, but I was talking about him for me the mechanism I used which really helped was literally writing it down and just reading it. Yes five minutes every day, but you start each day knowing what it is you want to do.	
1	I think that's really beautifully put Yeah, man, it's something that certainly rubbed off on me when I've spoken to in the past. I think one thing that I know will explore a bit more in the second half but I think it's best to probably say another where we started to talk about it a lot of people set goals of okay, if I get this I will be happy if I you know, say for instance if I get that car, then I can be you know this person now, but personal development gives you a greater sense of a fulfillment. It's a continuous Journey rather than saying right I want that and then when I get that that's that that makes sense, you know that sort of rather than striving for the material or whatever strive for being a better person being the person the person that you want to be, you know things that are external versus something that you can control such as how you live as a person whether you're a good person and there was a great thought.	
2	Like I read which is if you imagine you're at a funeral of a good friend and someone goes out to seek and they're giving the eulogy about this person. And it turns out it's your funeral and this is in you know, 50 60 years time. What would you want them to say about you? Would you want them to say, you know, some was a great guy and he earned three million a year and was the best CEO that the ftse 100 17 or would you want them to say some was a really caring husband? He was a great friend. He was kind. Yeah, and it's that sort of realization. Again, this is something I think we'll just come on to in a bit is understanding what matters to you understanding? What does matter you know, and I think that that's that's something that's pretty crucial to find, you know, what matters to you and also mostly paying for a lot of people for most people passing the outside so I could pass is going to be how you are as a person.	
1	So yeah, I mean that that's really just got me thinking what you just said. I think that's a great thing if you know, I'm sure a lot of people Listening to this will live we'll just stopped just then and thought wow, you know and you need those sort of moments. The only when you just think ahead how would you like to be described? I think that's really beautifully put actually some yeah. I just wanted to also touch before a little break that we always have a little bit about Cambridge University as well. Obviously you went there. I think it was four years ago. So long time ago and it came Cambridge everyone has a view of Cambridge University, you know, they've ever heard about it and you know, obviously it's full of hundreds thousands of you know, incredibly smart hardworking individuals. I want to say, you know, just what was uni life like at Cambridge. Was it the quintessential uni life. Could you go out always it Relentless hard work? Was it quite daunting?	
2	Yeah, I think again it comes down to what you what you're looking to get. You all worked. Unbelievably hard. There's no doubt that I think comparing I did science group. And in terms of raw output, we probably get through for three or four times as much a year as another University with smaller terms, you know, so it is it is a grind but that doesn't mean that you can't go out and enjoy yourself. I think I still go out three or four times a week. First year at least and just accept that I was going to feel rough to next day and have to grind out an essay even when I was still hung over. So I think you can bounce it. Right and I think I probably didn't get the balance right? So I said but you certainly you certainly learn I know so many great people that who have a good time, but you can definitely have a social life. That's it was actually one of the biggest apprehensions I had and I got real cold feet before going down in the winter festival with a couple of mates. I was thinking And you know I'm going to the place is going to be no fun. It's not going to be no going out and I mean it's complete bollocks. Right? Like there's other people that are similar minded to me and a lot more fun and better personality than me so you can just sort of tag along with them and have a good time.	
1	Yeah. It's just, you know something that's often leveled is going Boudreaux yodel massive nerd. It's just not true is it?	
2	Work hard play hard.	
1	Yeah. Yeah exactly. So and I think that's actually lovely place to stop the first half of this conversation and do our world-famous pointless factors the Gable. Thank you so much for joining in xela. Yeah. So as always a point as fact it was yeah, you know like the guests go first, so	
2	What is your point as fact some well for those who don't know I studied plant Sciences in my final year. I specialize in plants. So we've got a plant related flag tip. So this applies to daisies and some flowers because they're both in the same family. The asteraceae family. The petals is imagine a sunflower petals around the outside of the sunflower. There's no yellow petals. They aren't actually paddles individual flowers. And in the Centre of some flour. There's lots of little stalks. They are also Individual flowers and it's called a composite flower. So one sunflower head actually has about 450 files on it. Maybe not.	
1	Wow composite flowers composite flowers. That's a good one. Big find a lot. I mean I didn't actually know them myself. So that was that was actually very good wisdom. There we go. Okay. So my point is I've gone down the route nowadays of making them a bit interactive because I get quite a lot of messages from people being like Oh, how was I supposed to get that one? So here's one for you some and for all the listeners. Where is the largest Japanese population outside of Japan?	
2	Okay. I'm going to go with. China No, not so far away now.	
1	Okay, I'll give you one more guess gone. Stace yes now, okay, but that would have been my initial thinking as well. So I learned this on my Brazilian history course and as you can tell from Brazilian history is Brazil, so they were brought across in sort of the early 20th century to because they were hard workers which is consciousness that there's one point six million Japanese Who currently live in Brazil.	
2	Wow. Yes. It's pretty pretty pointless.	
1	Fact a pretty pointless when it comes to countries. Yeah. Well that concludes pointless days little Echo their love it. And so the first half obviously we decided to cover the mentality side that you've forged over the years from when you were younger and now I just want to hone the chat in to talk about the more personal. Events of the last year in your life and that's dealing with with ewing sarcoma now. I was wondering if you could just explain to the listeners exactly. What ewing sarcoma is?	
2	Yeah, so I'll go I'll go I basically this is during my finals. I was I was quite I was told I'd get a bit stomach pain and I was quite a little got through the finals and I was all right, and I was hospitalized once or twice. And then sort of June mid June 2018 an MRI scan and they found a pretty large tumor near my stomach and then still a couple more tests and they found another seven tumors in bone and throughout the rest of the skeleton. And you start coma is 50 case in the UK. Yes. It's pretty shit luck is maybe like one in a million chance of getting it just lasts and yeah, yeah. It's a bone on bone cancer spreads very rapidly. And yes a lot. I got my diagnosis. 1215 months ago mid-july this sort of finally diagnosed it. I was pretty rough at the time. One of the tumors was they must fine. And as for the fractured my spine and was pressing on the spinal cord and they told me I was two weeks away from being paralyzed just depending on whether I responded well to the drugs. They said given how progress is. There's a 20% chance your lives past five years. Um said, you know, you can go to your chemo and stuff and lose all your hair and you'll probably be in first and all that stuff. So yeah, but you know, we're 15 months and I'm still there so Let's go on the pot now.	
1	I mean, it's incredible the way that you've you've dealt with the events and ourselves one question. I want to ask with regards to just with ewing sarcoma itself is are there any causes it doesn't run in a family or as it is it somewhat random.	
2	Yes. Oh Same as any cons to really not there are genetic factors that can increase your likelihood. But with that they'll look at your immediate family and there was nothing there for me. There are lifestyle factors for particular cancers, you know smoking is terrible for lung cancer and esophageal cancer and liver cancer with sort of drinking but beyond that there's sort of not many so it just comes down. Too bad luck, you know you have to have four mutations in particular genes in one particular cell to get a sort of cancer cells. So is he is just incredibly unlikely particular young age.	
1	But so yeah, no cause basically now and that's maybe you know the hardest part to deal with the fact that it is, you know, just somewhat a bit random and it's just as you said bad luck in a way but you know the mindset and that purpose let's say You find when you when you were younger did this prepare you for this sudden and quite shocking development.	
2	Yeah, massively to be honest and in all honesty. I found a diagnosis fairly easy to deal with and it sounds odd saying that no, I'll have to sort of took some other data a little bit explain that but going back to those things that are sort of live by everyday. There were a couple of things on that there was there were one of these things to rights or growing up. We had a friend who passed away and a couple of other big moments in my life, which made me realize the importance and value of human life again reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is a great book which talks about that and So some of the things that we're sort of on my list and I wrote and I wrote this session. I was like 18, maybe one was to smile last be happy as if it's your last day as if it's the only thing that counts second one was to appreciate the beauty of Life appreciate your family your friends and your existence and Sutton was to improve the life of everyone you meet every opportunity and every moment and yeah, so I sort of I live my life by those and others living is fully as I could every day for a good two three years, you know and having those things in place and that every day. I salute I was just I was happy and I wasn't taking anything for granted that tune us pretty crucial things, you know, so many people it's so easy to go through on autopilot looking not looking around you see in the birds in the trees. Is a preaching not busy or looking around and seeing your family there. Even if I pissing you off just remembering that they are. So terrorists and so important and I think this is this is very tied into the minus on this stuff. It's been talked about a little bit, you know being present at every moment. Yeah, you learn to Value things a lot greater and you don't let things go unsaid and I think there's so much in life that you can't control and you don't know what's going to happen. But that's the only way you can elicit as it as if each day is your last day because throttle for you know, it could be so yeah when I got the diagnosis that was no big shock in the sense that I knew. I knew life wasn't forever. I've been living my life knowing that it wasn't granted forever. And I told everyone that I loved and that love me and I let them know that all my life, you know, or at least the last couple of years and so when it when it came to her when they were like, you know, there's a very very slim chance you're going to be here five years time. I wasn't I don't know. It's like well, yeah, I didn't assume that I would be any time and Having no regrets. Yeah, they were doing no regrets about the way I live my life for anything. I couldn't look back and pick fault because each day I'd sort of made the most of it and also know I think that's that's all you can ask for is having having no regrets and appreciating the value to your life. And yeah, it does it makes it makes things a lot lot easier to deal with I think that's you know, just an incredible other guy.	
1	Just want to say that myself, you know to one thing saying it but another thing Do it and I know that you do it and that is truly an inspiration to all of those around and all the people listening to this who won't know you just hearing those words. It's very powerful because you know, a lot of people have what I like to refer to as minor issues, you know, it might be getting down about having assays let's say but you know, sometimes you get hit with I like to say the real shit, you know, you get hit with a with a bad. Hand and that's when you you know, you make that choice I think and you can either fold or you can just be weirdly or weird side to the outside positive can and that's it. You have that choice and I just you know, we did you ever have a moment when you when you doubted that was that mentality so ingrained into the even at the lowest points of your your chemo, you still maintained that that positivity	
2	Yes, I think. Sally from the first diagnosis as when they found it. I was very fine. I was completely okay with it and Then I was pretty drugged up for a while. So there were moments in the more when you sort of you roll over in bed at 5:00 a.m. In the hospital. I was there was a period where I couldn't I wasn't allowed to walk. I was in bed for like five days like Donald and let's get up because paralyzed myself or whatever and then we most lying in bed their way you like you do doubt it you do doubts it but People around me my friends my family. They were there to support me. The Christie is the most amazing hostile the most amazing nurses and I'd say about it was weird. Actually it was about and I can remember it quite vividly lose two weeks after I'd sort of a week or so after I got out of hospital and and then got nominated come around we didn't in the puddle afternoon. We've gone back cooked dinner and I was Yeah, we did we sort of had dinner and I'd gone to bed and at this stage. I was sort of when the back brace I couldn't always allowed to walk without a back brace on I wasn't hard to get out of bed without its and my dad had to every night and every morning he to the put me a bad thing out the back brace and every morning I'd have to come in and I remember you getting it getting he was sort of getting me out of that bracelet. I was lying down in bed. Not sure I'm thinking fuck. Yeah, I would there's no chance. I'm not getting through this because there's there's no fucking chance and it is a choice man. Sing us the no, let me let me rephrase that for me. For me, I think I think it was a choice. I think everything's a choice and I think Dylan says a really beautiful from a book that we saw both read about in between stimulus and response is the ability to choose and in that it's our behavior is not determined by our conditions. It's determined by our decisions. You can choose how to react to something and for me. The choices were be sad and spend the next probably six months sad and unhappy or be happy and spend the next six months happy and it's not all there's no fucking choice though. So yeah, I think I mean there's a couple of things you touched on that one being the ability to do so. Yeah, and it was it was a conviction but undoubtedly my friends and family call me through it. But yeah the truck the choice I think is a real real thing and I'd read it every morning my dad read every morning, you know be strong you will get through this. I've even got 102 found was quite funny. I was reading earlier. Because your values tiredness and cancer and not excuses and it was this it was my way of saying you're not going to use this as an excuse to be grouchy or snap at people being patient.	
1	I don't know maybe laughs actually I was the one that made me laugh as well because it's quite it's quite dark that that is understandable understandable at the time, but I think you're touching on something really important here which is writing things down, you know as a It's have affirmation as they say and reading it every morning no matter the circumstance, you know, if you're feeling it. I want to say a little bit depressed. You said it yourself before it doesn't have to be a life-changing event for you to want to change something in your life. You can just if you start to write things down like, you know, I'm going to be positive after a month. Imagine if you read every morning like five times, I'm gonna go and be happy. Yeah. Well you yeah exactly and that pops into your mind exactly. So and it's a slow. It's a slow change or the gradual change. And yeah, it doesn't have to be reactive to something awfully. You can be proactive.	
2	And as you did, you know, you did it years in advance as you said and I think I think you touched on something that it's important that we have those had some real shit that we've had to overcome in these last two years and it shouldn't really happen at age this young person has to deal with that but the reality laissez that there is suffering is going to sort inevitable, you know like It will happen live people don't live forever and you can't control everything. And so I think the sooner people learn that and get into those habits that just appreciating everything everyday every moment and living each day as if it's your last it put it does it doesn't you know, it doesn't cure anything but it makes it a lot easier to cope with us. I think I think that's you know, it's such an important thing might not like yeah, you have to get it because it's not going to happen. One day it hasn't you know already. It's just inevitable is just large exactly.	
1	Right and I think you've got to come to terms of that at some point whether it be today whether it be in 20 years, whatever everyone's going to have to come to terms with that at some point, but it's still, you know, such a testament to your character just being able to put into practice in you know, in the face of you know, shocking events. You need to maintain that energy to maintain that positivity many people can do that. I don't think it's a real Testament to the person that you are. I just also want to just quickly talk about the Christy mentioned the Christy and the amazing work that they do and could you just tell us a little bit about it? You know that amazing work.	
2	Just imagine like You seriously when you're when you're making you feel sick all the time. I your chemo through the drugs will run through the night and device will need to be changed every 4 or 5 hours. You've got the nurses. They're working eight hours straight 12-hour shifts rather from eight to eight through the night and I sort of I get to go to bed. I sleep and then I'll just press the buzzer when the bag needs change it and they'll come in and they'll go into someone else's room. And now don't clean up the sick or someone's floor. Those food that they need to serve them the medicine. You can't imagine how hard that must be to do and how and yet they maintain this positive attitude throughout it like that and they get you through it as well. You know, like just our friend they're friendly faces and that's all the tension and the bonds to build but it goes down to even like the cleaners. I mean, I remember the woman that came in to clean he I was planning my Tunes when she was coming in which is I like this stuff is but little Funk and soul was like, yeah. You in sighs? Yeah, you see you should check out kills Klaus. He's just started recommending me a couple of songs that sort of connection is unbelievable. It's unparalleled and it goes right to the top, you know, it goes right from the people the porters that sort of Willie the wheelchairs round. So the people on the door the cleaners the nurses especially the nurses they're golden. Well, that's the Consultants, you know, like people people that care to next that I'm not	
1	You can't imagine you know, yeah, is it kind of the world to do figure for so many people they are incredible. I don't think they get the recognition. They deserve still it's amazing that human connection is such an underrated thing and they work hard, you know, as you said, they actually work hard not like oil put in a few hours. They you know, they save lives through they do and I really don't think Nurses get enough credit for the work that they do day in day out for people who need it, you know, and I know that that's close to Ross's heart as well. And I know that that was the question that he wanted me to put forward to you to discuss so that we've covered those postal Advance units very powerful what you've been saying me as well, even though I I'm aware of what's happened. You know, it's still every time my hear it and it's so inspiring and I'm going to just bring it back to almost full circle back to what we can call an inverted commas normal life. How have you found that assimilation back into the trials and tribulations of everyday life?	
2	Yeah, it was frustrating at first because they thought if they don't tell you that she has to come see it's not sort of you just think it through and then he could go there's just all these like niggly little things but injuries you pick up and appointments that you actually if I could have just gone with lighter would have been perfect but you sort of tracks back into things and waylaid and I'm quite impatient person so that that's a bit of a pain. But yeah, you know, I've moved down to London now and I've got back into that sort of routine. I'll go I got a job seen a lot my friends. Yeah, it's wonderful to have that again for me enough. I'm sure you were going to ask about job and I'll preempts that I always knew it was I wanted to under Consultants everyone listening and it sounds like a white thing to say, but I knew I wanted to do it for a couple of years because it's a great way to learn about management and Leadership and organizational skills. And ultimately I wanted to go into Charter sector and that's sort of what I wanted to do. This is for the necessary settings to London can be quite a lonely City. I was trying to this the big issue guy today actually. And he had this girl. What did you say? I said, it's just shit that so many people walk past you and don't even look at you don't know your name and I'll do that every day. And you said yeah, Amanda people have the business the other the other things the other life and and I just, you know, I think it's important to I've known men to step back and just think about the other people are around and not be on autopilot thinking. I've got to get this mix this meeting or whatever and yeah think about what it is that matters because and to be honest are sort of existential terminals term it powered up because I really yeah, I really want to be this with your glasses masses, but we'll see we'll see you got it wasn't as inspiring as you want. No, no.	
1	No, it's all yours. We want honesty and then that is a very Once and that's what works for you for other people. They might you know consultancy might be the thing that they want to do. This is the whole point of so subjective. But the point that you mentioned about just thinking about other people the power of smiling at something that Ross is as open about a lot just to power of the smiling at someone random. It can mean a local make someone's day. I mean, I know when someone random Smiles at me kind of gases me a little bit. I'm like hey Yeah, that's a nice thing subconsciously the ginger locks that I'm currently sprouting.	
2	No one no one stops when they take their coffee to say thank you. I was like got it and gone. They're talking on the phone, you know, just take a minute deep being mindful of where you are people around you give them a smile. Let's just say and give him the time of day and just see the humanity of people like me pretty big difference be completely right and I London London needs that more completely.	
1	So like that's what I've always found and I go down the tube as you so rightly pointed out God that can be a an intense environment. Just everyone looking at the floor flicking through a phone that doesn't currently have any Wi-Fi on for the sake of it. It's quite a bleak Outlook. It's something that you know should be changed. You should be able To talk to the person next to you without everyone thinking you're a weirdo, but unfortunately, the culture just isn't at that place so looks I mean coming on today. Just thank you so much for finding the time because I know that so many people will listen to this and just feel so invigorated not just by what you've had to deal with in the past year, but just by your overall mentality that was forged from such a young age. I want to ask you what are the three two or three things that you Like listeners to take away from this conversation.	
2	Okay, and let me let me just think about that so I sort of get it, right. I think it's through the bayous. I found that I've sort of helped me change my life and I'd say those are To appreciate the beauty of life every moment. You know that that's your family your friends your existence walking down the street the birds whatever it is, the next one will be to live each day as if it's your last smile last be happy and live each day every day as if it's the only one that counts and yet enough final one is to improve the life with everyone. You meet every moment an opportunity. That's that's my three.	
1	I just think not so beautiful and just a perfect place to end because it's just those words, you know, if you can apply that to your own live. It's not going to just get better overnight as we've said but it's about are you going to be a better person next year or you know, then you then you were after listening to this book.	
2	Reading I like that but I don't mean you spoken about them and stuff. I've spoken with one or two people but and they've also found it helpful. So hopefully a couple of people will enjoy it and not think I'm a complete wanker for saying sir.	
1	Well, I'd be very surprised if anyone thought that after this comes at the issue, they would be an interesting individual if they thought that to put it lightly but not yet Sam. I just want to reiterate again. Thank you so much. And you know, I'd love to have you on again in a few months when? You see how consulted the see the consultancy world has been treating you in a few months. It'll come out my big see if it changes your mind. But look just for our listeners obviously episode was one that we've been looking forward to for a long time. The next episode we have is another interview. In fact next few days. As I said Ross will be back for that one, but the interviews are coming thick and fast now we feel that it's a good time to do a journey. Is quite dark November nights having some inspiration coming your way from various people of the younger Generations. So we'll be checking back in in the next couple of days. And until that point keep doing what you're doing guys. See ya.
