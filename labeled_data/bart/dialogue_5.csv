I'll get your messages. I'll play them on the show and we'll talk about video games together. Thanks so much for listening. Let's get started. So there are a lot of people who are upset that ninja got paid to play Apex Legends. Let me rewind let me go back and just give you all of the context. And by the way, I just want to apologize for the audio quality. I am recording this from my headphones. I'm going to hotel room right now, and I'm at a conference and I wanted to get an episode out last night, but I was on the road all day and just didn't have time. So let's talk about let me let me rewind and give you give you the lowdown Ninja for those of you who don't really follow twitch stuff is like the biggest streamer certainly the most famous and he's got he brings in ridiculous amounts of people. And he usually streams Fortnight. Now Apex Legends is the latest Battle Royale. If you don't count Tetris and its really really popular it got really popular really fast. Now some might say that that's because big streamers played it and they streamed it. However, I don't know if I subscribe to that. I think that really the reason that it's it got really big really fast as because it's free and it's also really good. I've talked about the the game before so I'm not going to spend time gushing about it again, but it's a really good game. And I think that's really the reason why it caught fire, but it was just revealed that Ninja Was paid a million dollars to do basically a sponsored stream. Now, I tried to find out if it would if it was disclosed that it was a sponsored stream. I couldn't find out whether it was or whether it wasn't some people said that it was some people said that it wasn't some people said that they watched and he said that it was not and other people said that they watched and he said that it was so There's no way for me to know whether or not it is or is not disclosed. And that's really the Crux of what I want to talk about today because that determines whether or not what happened was bad because if if it was disclosed that hey, this is a sponsored stream. I'm going to play this game, you know, they don't have to say how much he was paid. That's that's he's perfectly entitled to his privacy about how much money he makes and as much as I dislike EA they're entitled to their privacy about how much money they spend. It's nobody's business how much money changed hands but if money did change hands, I think that it's important that the people who are watching are informed about this transaction. Because then they know if they should take what what the streamer says with a grain of salt or not. Now I've seen people making comparisons on Twitter comparisons to journalists being paid to give a high review score and I'm certainly not here to tell you that that is something that happens. I have seen people accuse journalists of giving a high review score to a game that they didn't like But guess what? Not. Everybody likes the same games. So just because of some journalists enjoyed a game. And you didn't it doesn't mean that they were paid that their shell it could just mean that they have different tastes than you and make perhaps you should go to a different journalists find somebody whose tastes more aligned with yours. And if you if you find somebody whose taste more aligned with yours, then more than likely you're going to find out the information that you want. You're going to you know, if I tend to In the people whose opinions I agree with on video games because then if they say that a game is really great. I'm like, oh, well, you know what we kind of like the same stuff. Maybe I'll try out this game. That's kind of beside the point. We're is my train of thought usually I have like bullet points written down in front of me at least a little bit. Okay, so the idea that Ninja Got paid to stream a game is not a problem with me. I kind of put this as the same thing as some some sports ball player being paid to endorse a pair of sneakers and that happens all the time people don't jump up and down because it's obvious that it's a commercial. Now somebody streaming a game if that's their job. It's not obvious that that's a commercial. So that's why I feel like the fact that it's a commercial that it's sponsored should be disclosed. I mean, it should be disclosed in the title. I don't know if it was disclosed in the title. I don't know if it was disclosed at all and if it's not disclosed, that's a problem. But if it was disclosed then I don't see any problem with Ninja. Getting paid to stream again. I think it's perfectly acceptable. In fact, if a developer came to me and said hey Bill, we want to give you X dollars to do a stream of our game I'd say, okay, I would also be incredibly honest about that. I would say hey everybody. This is a sponsored stream. I put it in the title that it was sponsored and I still would say things that I didn't like About the game. I still would say things that I liked about the game. You don't have to be dishonest just because you're being paid ninja playing Apex Legends and being paid for it just because he enjoyed the game or lets, you know, I didn't watch the stream. So I don't know but let's say let's let's pretend for a second that he said man. This is really good. Whoops. I just hit the nightstand. Let's say that he said oh, this is really good. But doesn't mean that he was paid to say that they just means that he was paid to stream it just because money changed hands doesn't mean that his opinion is suddenly bought and paid for At least if not, at least if I don't want to phrase this it doesn't mean that as long as he has integrity. I don't know. I don't know if he has Integrity or not. I know that most of the streamers that I watch I believe that they have integrity and if a game is a dumpster fire. Then they would probably tell me even if it was a sponsored stream, you know, they'd play through and they'd say man. I mean, I know this is sponsored, but I'm having trouble enjoying this game. The idea that ninja enjoyed Apex Legends a game that is in the genre that he focuses on that has incredible movement and is pretty well balanced, I think. I feel like it wouldn't be surprising that he would enjoy that game. I mean does that seem surprising to you? So I really don't get why everyone is up in arms that being said if I'm missing the Mark here if I'm wrong about something I would love it. If you could let me know exactly how wrong I am.

I have been listening to your show for a while. And I've heard people ask you or even like on Reddit. I see all the time people asking. Hey, I just got a switch. What should I get for it? Hey, I just got a switch what games should I get so I was wondering if maybe you could give us the Run jump stomp version of you know, just got into a switch. What would run jump stomp get and that includes accessories games? What's the run jump Stop Nintendo switch package. What would you recommend to your audience? If they're looking to buy a switch What accessories games all that? Good stuff. Thank you. There's a pretty good question. I suppose it depends on what kind of game you want. But if I were to build a like a bundle for me, like if I had if I didn't have these games and I and I want to do knowing what I know and I wanted to buy a bunch of stuff at once. The first thing I would buy of course is the I would get the neon ones because the I think that looks better than the gray. I would also by a Pro Controller because some games are better with the Pro Controller in some games are better with the joy cons that are really depends on what type of game you're playing. So you definitely want to have both I would not. Yeah, I would also buy a case the case that I have is a water-filled case and it's pretty expensive. I got it at at a deep discount because I did a review of it on my YouTube channel. And talked about it on my Nintendo on my other podcast Nintendo switch craft. So I have trouble recommending that case because it is really expensive. In fact, I can't remember off the top of my head how much it costs and I'm like, you know what let me grab my iPad real quick and I'll look it up. But while I'm while I'm looking it up, I will talk about what games what I recommend that people pick up for the No switch the number one game without a doubt that there's absolutely no question in my mind would be Legend of Zelda breath the wild. It is an amazing amazing achievement in gaming and anybody who has not played it. I feel like you're just you're just missing out on on something amazing and I would recommend that you you play that with the Pro Controller. It feels really really nice. other than Zelda everything else depends on what kind of game you like if you want to if you're looking for something that has like like an online RPG kind of thing. Then I would go with a Diablo. I adore Diablo. I think it's amazing. Let's see what else could we talk about? We could if you enjoy online competitive play then I would say something like Splatoon to or you know, Fortnight is is that's an easy call because that's free. You can pick up fortnight. If you're looking for a good puzzle game, I would say you should pick up puyo. Puyo Tetris on that game is really really great. And it controls so well and the audio design in that game is really Top Notch as well. And then of course, I would say get Nintendo switch online so that you can put get Tetris 99 because that's fantastic and you need Tetris money or you need Nintendo switch online in order to play. You know make the most out of Splatoon to and Fortnight. Actually. I don't know if you need Nintendo switch online to play Fortnight. I could be wrong about that.	
1	So.	
3	I think that it's hard to answer that question because because so many of these games are for different people and that's one of the great things about the switch is it feels like they've they've got everything together that you want like they have something from this genre and something from this genre. However, if you're a massive first person shooter fan, I would say Doom you want to pick up or Wolfenstein to though I haven't played that I've heard. Extremely good things about it. If you're looking for something that has really quick matches that you can play online and very short amounts of time. I would I would recommend rocket league and if you're looking for something to just kind of play when you are chilling out, I would recommend Pokemon, let's go because it's really really good. As far as a good jrpg. You can't go wrong with octo path Traveller. And I'm trying to think of other genres that I haven't mentioned yet. Oh a good metroidvania a great metroidvania that I would recommend would be steamworld dig to that is a ridiculously good metroidvania Style game, which I just adore. I think I don't I don't have it on switch, but I think it came out on the switch and it is Crypt of the necrodancer, which is another roguelike. I think there is which is a roguelike you you would be well it would be good. If you check that game out. I think it's on switch. But oh, here's a roguelike. That's definitely on switch. I can't believe I didn't think of it because it's my favorite robe like of all time and I have it on switch and that is Rogue Legacy an amazing game where well, you know, I've talked about it on my other podcast before so make sure that you go over and check out Nintendo switch craft. You know, there's just so many different things. I don't know if I could nail down a bundle that wouldn't cost a fortune because I bought these things or receive these things all over a long period of time, but if you are looking to spend as little money as possible and you want to have an amazing experience Get the switch get a case. And I found the price for the case is $79 over at SF bags.com. It's a nice leather case get breadth of the wild get a Pro Controller and get yourself an SD card because you're going to be downloading a lot of games in the future. I recommend I have a four hundred gigabyte SD card because I was on sale for like less than a hundred. But I would recommend picking up, you know, a smaller one. Maybe maybe 200 gig or a hundred twenty-eight might be good to start out with and then later on in the future. If you know when you when you could spend more money on it get the bigger card because there's a lot of games on a switch and other developers are not as good as Nintendo is and making sure that I don't want it for Making sure that their games are optimized to take up is smaller footprint on your on your storage as possible.
