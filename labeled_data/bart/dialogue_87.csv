2	Welcome to the third season and episode 333 of the stoic meditations podcast. We are each time. We consider a bit of wisdom from the ancient philosophies of Greece and Rome. I am Massimo pigliucci a professor of philosophy at the City College of New York, and I will guide you through this reading Today's Reflections come from Marcus Aurelius in meditations. 769 The Perfection of model connector consists in this in passing every day as if it were the last in in being neither violently excited nor torpid nor playing the hypocrite. There are two fundamental ideas embedded in this passage from Marcus. The first one has to do with the famous historic notion that we should live every day as if it were our last not literally of course Marcus isn't envisioning writing and rewriting his will and testament every morning as he gets up. Rather the idea is to live every day to the fullest because we don't know how many more we have ahead of us sure. We can imagine on the basis of statistical expectations that will live so many more years given our current age biology social status and so forth. But truly we don't know there is no Assurance available. So why waste time we Pursuits that do not interest us or that we don't find important enough. The second thought is the advice to live neither in the trolls of violent emotions nor in torpor and especially not as a hypocrite. If you are prone to Violent emotions, we are likely not to reason well through our problems, which is not conducive to a good life. At the other end of the spectrum though. If we don't act vigorously on things, we're not going to contribute to society and we're not solving our own problems either. As for not being a hypocrite. The reason should be clear it will mean that you say one thing and do another which is clearly not a virtuous conduct for human being who wants to become a better member of the Cosmopolis.
