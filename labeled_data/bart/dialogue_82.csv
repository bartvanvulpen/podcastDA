I have 12 years experience working in a VA with children with ASD. I thought I knew a lot however after attempting the Beast few times with no avail, I have been humbled I found myself built-in pigeon-holed into one small area of a ba in Wind taking the test. I realized that one area isn't all they test you on listening to the two of you used terms frequently and functionally has helped me so Thousands of dollars on exam prep materials but never got as much out of them as I have listening to real life examples of Behavioral principles.

So I just want everybody to know that I accidentally scheduled this trainer.

It wasn't intuitive. You'll get what I mean. Anyways, let's get started today's episode. I'm really excited because we have a guest who I absolutely adore and whenever I talk to her I feel so Zen. She's so cool my Great friend. I got to live with her for a year. And when I tell you all about her going to be jealous that I got to live with her for a year and our guest today is yell. Guden. She is a professional plant-based chef. And yeah, she was in vegan and culinary school when we lived together.

I mean like if she's out of milk, please follow her on her Instagram at what does it empowered plate and powered palette and oh my God empowered palette and that is death going to be on the show notes. Yeah. Well welcome.	
1	Hello. Thanks for having me super stoked pleasure.	
2	Love to You hear? Yeah, looks like I finally get to hang out with you. Yeah, when I lived together in Austin, it was perfect. I actually lived with Yell sister Talia in University of Maryland in college. And then I was moving to Austin after to follow a boyfriend. I didn't end up with and old days, right? Yeah all days good times. Yeah, and talia's like my sister's moving their you should totally live with her and I thought I was going to be living with this sorority chick and she was not let me tell. Tell you she is like an earthy vegan if I accidentally didn't recycle something you would think the world was going to end and she was like catch me eating like Twizzlers and stuff and be likely I why you have a healthy alternative. Let me cook you up some I don't even know what she would make. I mean these smoothie Bowl she'd make in the morning, but I got access to all of this because I was living with her. I mean it was the coolest year of my life.	
1	We got did have to hide her candy from me though and eat in her car.	
2	I like we have bags of Twizzlers are Twizzlers. Kosher. Yes. The question they are Kosher or else I wouldn't be representing them. Okay, they are I just want to double-check keep you on track hold you accountable. Thank you so much. So for today's episode, I think it's really interesting. And yeah that I miss anything about you before I keep going.	
1	No, I think I think you got most of it summed me up.	
2	Well, you can find UL in a local Whole Foods you can find her. Her in a yoga class. You can find her where else can we find you Farmers like Brian Kramer's Market buying crystals. Basically. Yeah look up someone from Portland and I think you could find you out. Right but she just moved there actually for school. She was an Austin before which is also keeping it weird. So she's across the board. Yell is so cool. All right now for today's topic, I think it's really interesting and I dropped the subject to Casey and Casey seemed AF about it too because I know there's a lot of talk about it and a lot of people I think don't know what it is. And today we're going to be talking about intuitive eating and the behavioral principles will cover today are deprivation verse satiation food as a reinforcer Mo Sun condition reinforcers maintenance operant behavior self-management and response effort. So yeah, well, can you tell us what the hell is intuitive? Eating based on what it sounds like I was like I'm into this but tell us all about it.	
1	Yes. Absolutely. I agree with you. It's kind of like a Hot Topic right now that a lot of people might hear and not know specifically what it is. So to break it down intuitive eating is a nonlinear approach to health and food and your overall well-being where the fundamental belief is that you are the expert of your own body. And so The traditional Health realm where we're constantly told to look outside of ourselves at the latest, you know Health Trends and gurus and food rules. What's good for you? What's bad for you intuitive eating asks that you actually just tune into the unique messages your body sends you and determine what is best for your health based on what you feel in your own body. So it's going to be different for every single person and again because you are the expert of your own body. Nobody can decide better than you what you really need. It's also a system that really helps restore a more empowered enjoyable and peaceful relationship with food and your body as opposed to having you work against and fight your body all the time and guys.	
2	This is if you think about this, this is like private events, right? This is what happens inside your own skin your own verbal Behavior what you tell yourself what you are thinking in your head? Relate it back. Behaviourally a little bit more is like this. These are things that are happening right in your own skin, and you need to pay attention to them. Exactly. So wait, I like like this can we eat whatever we want if you do intuitive eating like so I could have the Twizzlers now. Would you give them back to me now?	
1	I would actually allow you to have those Twizzlers now and there is an interesting reason why because intuitive eating believes that when you put foods off-limits like when you create hard rules about what you can and can't have what's happening on a on a instinctual level as that, you're just actually creating a stronger desire to have I've got food, right? It's like the classic kid with the cookie jar situation. Look what happens when Mom leaves and the cookie jar is now unguarded right like the kids will try to eat as many as possible in order to like load up before Mom gets back.	
2	So with the Twizzlers, I found like you a hundred percent. I'd be like nails on hell. Yeah bust out the Twizzlers. I am and the Sour Patch Kids you were in an establishing operation Leon, right? You're like at motivation the value increased so much for those things because you weren't allowed to have them.	
1	It's like when you go all weak and psychos just letting you have access to the Twizzlers and eat them whenever you want without making like a rule around it then maybe you wouldn't have felt the need to like, you know load up on your car when I was away for the weekend.	
2	Exactly. Well, I also think that's a common state of behavior. Like we could put this behaviorally into deprivation right when you deprive Yourself as something then how much more do you want to write? Like you're like, I can't be having this now. That's all I want. Right? I mean that's how it works. I mean it's even a simple as like don't think of a pink elephant now don't you want the Pink Elephant the think in your head so like I see how this works. Also. I assume when you're trying to stick to all these diets and like you create these contingencies if I'm only gonna reward myself when I do this for how many days I mean Casey what's one of the I feel like you've done like Whole 30? Yeah. Definitely. I've done probably everything and Whole 30. I actually thought was pretty good to just figure out if you had any sensitivities and I don't know if I'm that is something that you see But like eliminating like the top kind of things from your diet just to see if it does affect you right and then slowly reintroducing it. I like that style. But again, you are you're limiting yourself so you can't have carbs can't have gluten. So then guess what? All you freaking want is a pizza, right? Like you're like, I can't have it like, oh my God right versus that open flexibility or the psychology the psychological flexibility of being like I can have it if I want it does it? Serve my body right now. Is it going to make me feel good? Do I know the consequence of when I eat pizza? I feel sluggish. I may have you know, some Diet, you know some potty issues. So yeah, I like I love this is great.	
1	And I'm just curious Casey like when you went off the Whole 30 what happened in your relationship with those foods that were then off-limits.	
2	So I think my biggest takeaway from that. Was that putting food in your body that's going to actually energize you. And make you feel good. So fueling your body with food that is going to produce energy. So you didn't go back to eating pizza dough. I loved a literally pizza every day. That's the place.	
1	I love what you said because so to answer your question from earlier like a lot of people think okay. If I if I ditch the diet mentality, which I'll name as the first principle of intuitive eating. eating is stepping away actually from those diets from the strict rules about what's quote-unquote good or bad for you and instead giving yourself permission to include all different types of foods in your life in a way that promotes balance and you know, just Variety in general so To answer the question. Can I eat whatever I want? It's like yeah, you can you can eat whatever you want. But if you truly are in tune with yourself and listening to your body, as you said Casey, I would I would imagine and I've experienced and I know a lot of people I work with have experience that you do want to eat more foods that make you feel good because when you are connected to how you feel after certain foods, you're less likely to just eat, you know foods that drain that energy or that make you feel Early tired sure, you're going to eat them sometimes but I think people have this idea that like if I didn't have this super intense discipline around what I ate, I would just like, you know stock up on french fries and Twizzlers all day and I think we need to give ourselves more credit than that.	
2	Wait. Yeah. I have a question. Yes your his question. So okay. Yeah L was like the vegan Queen does this mean if your body is telling you that you need a milkshake now, you'll drink it.	
1	I think I would I mean I still hold certain ethical beliefs around veganism. So I would go for a vegan milk shake but that reveal a secret one time yelled. Oh God.	
2	She's like this is like literally the most is like me telling everyone that she like slept with 73 people in one night. But like for Yale's standards she got really drunk and I had ice cream in the in the freezer. Like I had like a full like it was also like not just like a Ben & Jerry sighs it was Like a devil's eyes one because it was like a TV brand or something and I come the next morning and it's completely gone and I'm like, huh and I'm like y'all did you eat this? She's like no, I'm like, yeah. We're the only ones in here like it was not me last night. Like I did you eat this and you're like, oh my God, I'm freaking out. I don't remember like I was so drunk and I'm like you ate that and she was like freaking out and like could not believe she had Dairy but obviously her intuition was telling her that she needed that ice cream right then.	
1	Well, it's actually interesting that you bring that up because you know, what is what is one thing that alcohol is famous for write it like it relates to our inhibitions, right? So clearly I was feeling deprived of like ice cream or whatever. It is something sweet. And so as soon as I remove those inhibitions, I felt the compulsive need to eat the entire gallon of ice cream happy.	
2	I'm happy you went all out. Like if you're going to break something like do it, right, you know, like not like a chocolate totally.	
1	No, not like a single chocolate chip, but that's another thing about intuitive eating is that a lot of people like kind of swing back and forth from these extremes of being really strict with their diet and then kind of saying like fuck it and just I broke the diet. I'm gonna go all out and eat all my favorite things and maybe eat more of them than I really want to but it's that mentality of going between extremes that actually creates a lot of Shame and guilt around food rather than just like mop, you know, like enjoy All of the different types of foods you're craving in in smaller doses are in moderation and legalizing them in your day-to-day life. So you don't feel the need to like eat the gallon of ice cream. You can just have you know a serving at a time.	
2	Yeah, like your veiled my biggest secret.	
1	It's a secret you exposed me.	
2	So embarrassed right now. It's one of those things like I found myself doing a lot. I'll go all week. I'll fast like, you know till like 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon and then, you know eating really healthy. Dinner and then Friday comes and it's like gung ho Pizza Sushi Chinese food, like wherever Wings blue cheese like come on bring it on because I was good all week and I think about and you could probably you're the expert but what that does to your metabolism. I mean it has to affect it. You're not neutral neutralizing or giving nutrients to your body.	
1	Totally. Yeah, and so what happens and it's interesting that you know, you all speak so much about like deprivation and I'm curious to hear the connection. But like when you when you go through that process of whether it's fasting or just restricting your calories in some way even if you don't think you're restricting your calories, but to your body like your body doesn't actually know if that's intentional that you're on a diet or you're trying out some new fasting Trend or if you're literally like experiencing food insecurity or a famine. So on the weekend as soon as you are around abundance with Food or as soon as you like loosen the reins on the tight grip of your eating habits, your body is also kicking up your Cravings your hunger hormones your metabolism to try to compensate for that missed caloric energy that you missed out on. So again, it's like it's not even Something That We're consciously doing but as soon as your body believes that you're that you have access to food again, it will send you into overdrive to try to make up for that loss.	
2	In this would be phylogenic. Would it not in terms of Casey in terms of am I using that? All right. Yeah. It's an honor can't unlearn but I think a problem is that we need to remember also just talking behaviourally for a second it remember food is Food Water oxygen sex Jinx, of course, we both say that one believe activity. These are all unconditioned reinforcers like you are born from day one known as to teach you these things are valuable to you, right? You are born from day one saying okay. This is like this is something that I like write it maintained your behavior if you cried and you got food. Wow, I'm going to cry more. I'm going to get food again. So this happens but what we've set up is and this has been that we naturally need we've created this idea that food should be are like reinforcer for doing something like oh, yeah, I I started with my pajamas today. I went to the gym today now I get to eat right or like I starved myself six days out of the week. Now. I can go ham and put every single thing that I like could have spread out them across the entire week into one weekend or you know, and I think that like, I think that Maybe Society has also shaped the way that we look at Food whereas it should be something that is like you need. This is a human need is really I marry yeah, these are primary and unconditioned reinforcers. You need it and we're looking at it as that's our reward, right? Like how many people are like, I mean, I remember just yeah, I'm sorry. I mean not I'm sorry. I meant I'm sure you remember and yells also going to be embarrassed. I mentioned this. But your sorority days back before you were this hippie chick like you always were this girl at heart but I'm saying I remember even talking about it with you. Like how many girls would go the entire week not eating anything just so they could get super drunk on like and go. What was it Big Slice?	
1	Yeah. Oh, yeah the jumbo slice.	
2	Yeah by the bars after yes like, yeah, they go all weak not eating. Yeah, I mean but this is what's normal and it's normalized and it's reinforced and you look hotter in that skirt. You're wearing to go out to the bars that night or whatever it is. But or that's how they feel and I just think that people are using food as a reinforcer when it like something they need to work for where it should be something that they have.	
1	In their natural everyday life totally like how off you know, it's so normalized like how often do you hear people say I need to burn this off or I need to like work out so that I can go to brunch even here in like Fitness classes. A lot of Fitness instructors will use terms like, you know burn it to earn it and it's just like do you say something L. I actually do because I obviously am very strongly opinionated about this and it's really harmful because not everybody is there to like learn Our food and why can't we just enjoy moving our bodies without feeling like we need to compensate for food? It's like I don't ever have to think about needing to compensate so that I can take a breath or like use oxygen which is another just physiological need but why is there all of this language around food as if it's something we need to earn when it's like your body just requires food and you don't need to earn or compensate for your food and anyway, and that mentality is what's so damaging not even really the the food itself. I'm I love this.	
2	So this is not a weight loss strategy. It is not a weight loss strategy absolutely know what would you describe it as a lifestyle?	
1	I would describe it as I want to say lifestyle, even though I don't love that term. It's just a new mentality or a new approach to being in your body, you know, so I have also seen as intuitive eating has become friend here, like people advocating intuitive eating as like the diet where you don't diet and that's so counterproductive to the point of being because it's not a diet and in fact, you cannot practice intuitive eating while also trying to control or intentionally lose weight because as long as you're doing that as long as you are if you can't do it with Weight Watchers, for example, no, Like you like even though they say with Weight Watchers, you could eat whatever you want, but I'll keep ya as long as you're following externalized rules about what you should be eating and tracking your numbers and and having fear around going past a certain point. You'll never be able to actually tune into your body to tell you how much food you really need to feel satisfied. So intuitive eating separates out weight from your health and and really believe that you can be Healthy and you can focus on just practicing Health behaviors without feeling the need to control your weight and that your weight actually is not indicative of your health status.	
2	Can you do that is so true. I'm reading some things that she sent. Yeah, the body diversity and like the notion that we all have unique genetic Blueprints and the idea around like a scent set weight Point.	
1	Yeah. So, you know, we all there are several things that impact a person's weight. But really it comes down to like your jeans your environment and and your lifestyle right? So We think that we have we tend to think that weight is something that we have a lot of control over and that we can change our weight at any point that we decide to and that and anybody who's been on a diet before knows that that's not actually it's not actually that simple. It's not like you just do the diet you lose weight and then you never look back. In fact, you know what tends to happen as soon as you go off the diet if either of you like feel comfortable here, whoop, you gain it all back.	
2	And you know what like in the scale Fox right so much to you could wake up in the morning having not eaten anything and weigh a certain way and then add in the afternoon you go weigh yourself and you are to 7 pounds heavier or you you know, haven't Peter poop jet. So your this much like the number on the scale. I mean again, it's focusing on what makes you healthy right?	
1	Great. And like the reason that number goes back or the reason, you know, your weight comes back. And in fact, there are studies that show that in only like less than five percent of people can sustain intentional weight loss after a period of dieting meaning that 95% of the time and after a period of one to three years post diet you're going to gain that weight back and the reason why is because your body wants to be at a state of homeostasis, which means that it's keeping things at you know, your your internal set point of what is a normal and healthy weight for you and that number is different for different people based off of your Or metabolism your genes your culture so many lifestyle factors. So it's not that simple to just think. Oh, I you know, I'm going to go on a diet. I'm going to lose this weight and it's just going to stay off your body has so many complex mechanisms and Pathways to actually restore that weight that it wants you to be at and there's a reason it wants you to be at that weight and that weight is different person to person. So, you know, if you think that just adopting your favorite like And influencers diet and nutrition and fitness habits is going to allow you to have that person's body. It's just not because you have a completely different DNA blueprint than them.	
2	Right? And I think it's interesting because first of all like a Navy a how we have to have like an individualized plan for every person based on their needs whatever it is, but that and also it makes me think of when we talk about validity and as we know validity is the idea is something NG men measuring the relevant Dimension that you intended to measure so right so like I might be like, oh my God, she is so healthy. She's so skinny. Right? Like I'm thinking that they're right her body looking a certain way that that indicates that she's healthy, but that's not really a valid measurement. Right? Like that's not valid if I'm measuring someone's like level of Health. However, you plan on measuring it it wouldn't be there skinny. Like when I think about it after I was hospitalized and so sick. I lost 25 pounds. I felt sexier than ever. But I was at my most unhealthy point of my entire life. I mean, you know, like everything was wrong with me. And so, you know to try measure like, oh she must be healthy. She lost 25 pounds. She's so on her shit, right? Like little did they know my fingers are falling off in the background or whatever is going on that. I'm sorry. I had c-diff or you know, like your body is completely out of whack at that point. So I think that's an interesting site on validity in terms of what we think measures. Health or what? We thinks measure someone having their life together or you know, and it's not actually that at all.	
1	Absolutely. Yeah, like we live in this culture that prioritises and validates thinness over any other measure as as far as indicating your moral character and also your health status when really the two are are not as connected as we think and I think you put that so well lie out like I think We all know someone who's just naturally thin and eats whatever they want and never go like your sister could look like that.	
2	My sister's tiny to actually but look, yeah L sister literally like was a model she is so beautiful and like literally, I mean she does eat healthy, but I do think like even if she I mean in college, never mind, no, she used to like eat full takes drunk at night and like look at that person.	
1	That's just like they're naturally thin but we can't wrap our Mind around the fact that some people the same way are not exactly have a larger body and it's not anything to do they could be a much healthier eater and they might have a way more, you know, regular exercise routine and it just doesn't it doesn't mean that their body will change but you can't look at somebody and know what their health status is you can't tell what they're like metabolic markers of Health are or how off you know, how strong they are. We just can't tell.	
2	I just want to read something that I pulled off your Instagram which I love Yeah, an intuitive eating tip. Okay, guys. Hey Doodles are stocking for us anything deeper than base level that you provide us. Casey will find I might know why I think I should have been a private investigator in my past life. I shagged stalker. Anyways, actually just reviewing the records like you had have to do an assessment, right? Yeah. I'm just reviewing the records they all right. She says order the salad if that's what you want what you're craving. Being in the moment, but don't consistently order the salad because you think you should or you think that's a good choice. Right? So like you're saying if you feel like it in the moment and you want it do it, but don't do it based on. Oh, I have to have a salad, right that's part of the diet. And that's kind of talking about MO is Casey if you know what I mean in the moment, right like you have certain things that in one moment. What are a mosrite a mozar when we talk about kind of the background information that Either increases or decreases the value of a certain reinforcer a Punisher in that moment. What do I mean? Okay. So let's say like my body is in a state of deprivation of having anything healthy in a while. Like I've just been on a at a tailgate all day eating crap in my body. That's the background information, right? So in that moment, that's the mo right like a salad or some things in establishing operation from my body is wanting that right. So that's what I'm going to have right then. But on another day, sometimes I just crave a freaking hamburger to bite into right like that's what I want at the time obviously a vegan one yell never real me moo, but in that moment what you'd still be allowed? Oh my God yells really changed guys Adam. I used to like cook salmon and privacy like I like I like She's gone. Everyone looked at those to make it a JB come to my house tonight and but one thing talking about like demos and what's valuable in that moment. Like one moment. This could be valuable for the next hour something else can and I think of really prime example and tell me if this would be intuitive to me. It seems that way. Yeah. Oh, but so when I initially didn't know what was going on with my hands and I was in hospital and it was a result of not having any circulation my fingers started freezing off and they were like going from Black to whatever it was people would say like what can I bring to her in the hospital? What can I bring? What can I bring in? The only thing I wanted was watermelon and I like watermelon but like in no way is that something like I typically crave or I want or like I need just watermelon and that was the only thing I wanted at the time and like I literally ate like probably like two watermelons a day like just cut up and and you know a few months post like my amputation surgery someone sent me. Me an article from the Harvard Business review or Harvard Business or I don't know my brain is going blank right now, but it was essentially about like the circulation properties of blood circulation properties of watermelon and how like they actually like sometimes recommended as a replacement for Viagra, which I actually take now as a medication three times a day and no I don't have erections because its original use was for blood circulation. But anyways, like my body was telling We got you want watermelon. You want watermelon now, do I crave it? No, but that's all I wanted at the time and I found that so fascinating.	
1	That's totally intuitive. And and again, it's like you didn't even mentally understand why you were craving watermelon at the time but there's this inherent wisdom that your body has to know what it needs especially in a in a situation where there's something out of balance. So, you know, it's ironic because diet culture the system are like the system that exists that really promotes dieting as the way to health really demonizes cravings and tells us that our Cravings are something to it. Nor or that, you know, we need to fight or overcome our Cravings but in your case layout like you're craving was telling you the exact thing that you really needed and that was going to really benefit your body. So you listening to that and you giving your body what it needed was the best thing you could do for yourself at that time and probably had a really positive impact on your blood circulation at the time.	
2	I'm hashtag intuitive AF but you can use all 10 fingers you only lost maybe if you're lucky. I don't know. What's going to how will I okay? I'm right now sitting here going please tell me some Behavior tips some how do I start? What do I do? What are some things to think about to start being more of an intuitive eater? Yes.	
1	I think the number one way to start practicing intuitive eating is to just begin to notice when you make decisions about what you're going to eat. What are the factors that are coming into play that that come up for you as you're making that decision? So as we talked about if you're sitting down at a restaurant and you immediately think okay, what's the you know, quote unquote healthiest or like lowest calorie option.	
2	That's what I should order notice that and they now sorry, especially now because everywhere you go there's like it's 310 calories. It's 1928 that like it but I want yes bars. I'm like, oh my God. I'm trying to choose a healthy option and they're still shoot me in the face with the calories, right?	
1	So just like Italy underwater I don't I don't ever want to just order the water. No, I think that as soon as you bring in that number or that like external measurement of a food it inhibits your ability to actually check in with yourself and ask yourself what you feel like eating SO trading the rules about what you should be eating what you think would be a good choice and actually just start to feel into what you're craving what you feel like eating and instead of thinking about you know, how healthy this. All is or what? The calorie content is ask yourself. How do I want to feel after eating this or what value do I want to honor right now with this food decision. So really just starting to bring it to a more internal place that you're deciding for yourself what you want to eat instead of allowing some externalized message or voice tell you what you should order the next thing I would recommend for somebody who wants to start intuitive eating which is something you can do today. Is to start to get curious about the way that your body communicates with you in a unique which is unique to you. So how do you know you're hungry and what are the ways in which your body lets you know that you're hungry. How do you know when you're full and what are the cues that your body sends you to let you know that you've had enough to eat start to build awareness of these different cues so that you can build that sense of trust in your own body and you don't need to just look up what is a proper portion size for this. Food, but rather how much of this food do I actually need until I'm satisfied. And also just to start responding to your hunk like the bait the most basic intuitive eating recommendation I can make is just to honor your hunger which is another of the principles of intuitive eating. So when you feel hungry instead of like questioning yourself or asking yourself if it's okay to eat or if you can justify it in some way like what if you just gave yourself permission to eat and then you just moved on with your day and what would that change for you?	
2	It's allowing yourself to be where you are. Right? No matter what it may be what you may be feeling and checking in with yourself is a really hard being. It's you really got to be true and honest with yourself to be able to do this in verses like, you know, comparing yourself to whether it be something you're seeing on social media or what you think that you should be doing or what your friend is doing for this like I feel like I should like green juice and I just effing done. Okay, like I Lee don't like kale drinks, okay or smoothie bowls for that. Yeah. I really what I prefer and I've learned this through my body. I don't love like yogurt-based smoothie or a milk-based like I like when I drink something healthy, I'm doing air quotes here. I want like this tart juice of like beets lemon grapefruit Ginger like that type and I could probably a Beretta she's a pizza from are you Dating love that that's all other episode we should do but those things I know right because of and I try to force myself because smoothie bowls are so all the fad and like they look so pretty with the acai color and the Granola and the things that on my Instagram feed, but you know what it's like what if I told you that you never had to drink a kale juice if you didn't want to or like right you like nobody is forcing you to drink the Milky smoothie Kool-Aid you don't have to do it.	
1	And you know the no but there is a finding of guilt. Okay, like I could tell you if someone having health issues.	
2	It's like I mean when I was in Austin, I literally paid like a MD natural naturopathic doctor to like tell me exactly what to do. Right and it's like you need to be drinking bone broth. It made me feel weird. I didn't like it. It was gross like but like when you are in certain situations, you're like, okay. I'm unhealthy. I just need to listen right like so and especially like in those situation that's also an Mo like things are really valuable to you. So you listen right or like everyone saying like now drink celery juice right? Celery. Truth is fun a hot friend.	
1	It's yeah, it's trendy right now exactly.	
2	So you know you have so then you have that and you're like, okay I should be healthy now or I'm doing this because of this but whereas or personally I like to order fruit smoothies, right, but then there's all these things of like It should be like you should be getting veggies in your smoothie should be doing this and this and then like I ordered this drink and I fucking hate it. Okay, like I shouldn't be having to like take shots of a smoothie to try gulp it down. Right? Like I and I just feel like these behaviors are essentially just reinforced or like doing these certain things or reinforce even by like seeing someone get so many likes on Instagram about it. I like oh they did that and like they look good and this and that so you do it and like we buy into these	
1	Ideas that that's what we should like to yeah, and and you know, I do believe that there are people out there who are experts in nutrition and you know these different Medical paradigms, but somebody having a lot of Instagram followers does not necessarily mean that they know what's best for your body.	
2	That's not a valid measure either guys. That's another example of invalid measurement totally and	
1	You know, I do believe that there is Merit to some of these like Health Trends or these different things that are being promoted now sure but 100% you should always experiment and try something on for yourself and then decide for yourself if it works for you. Don't take anything. Even sometimes what your doctor is telling you like. Nobody knows more about your body and what something feels like in your own experience than you do. With intuitive eating it's like you have to develop that strong internal Compass so that you know when something sits right because you know, I use this example all the time but like something like broccoli for example is generally considered a healthy food, right? So it's like maybe you think I need to be eating more broccoli or like even if I don't like the taste of broccoli, it's healthy. I should be eating it. Some people may eat broccoli and get horrible gas or a terrible stomach ache and like not be able to function because Are so bloated for the rest of the day for that person maybe broccoli is actually not a healthy choice and maybe they can find another vegetable that works for them. So if their Doctor is recommending them to eat more broccoli, it's just not going to be the thing for them.	
2	So we not have a parent. Sorry to interrupt you, but I totally see this all the time like I want my kid to eat broccoli. So I'm going to cover it and cheese and isn't heated and it's like that defeats the purpose completely because then they're not enjoying or intuitive. We enjoying the broccoli, right?	
1	And then they also will have an association for the rest of their lives with like broccoli being this thing to be avoided at all costs instead, maybe find a vegetable that they actually just enjoy or like a way to have them eat more nutritious foods without trying to trick or force them.	
2	Now I have one other thing. I don't know if this is about intuitive eating but this is just about me and I look at it behaviourally in terms of response effort, which response effort is. Exactly what it sounds like your response takes a lot of effort. So like you would always amazed me when we lived together. Like you'd be like filtering your own water system making your own milk to put on top of your like veggie. You're like oats in the morning or like your Chia what puddings I don't even know and I'm like this chick is so not lazy. Like it amazes me is like so like I what do you recommend? Doing because I find a problem also. Why okay, this is I know this isn't maybe not intuitive. I like why it's easier to eat unhealthy for example, or like maybe you're not even listening to yourself intuitively because you're honestly doing what is easier at the moment and like the easy options are like have you ever gone on a road trip and like tried eating healthy along the way it's really like it's like, oh my God, I'm gonna try be healthy. I'm gonna get Plain potato chips right like or I'm gonna get this bar that is essentially filled with so much crap or whatever it is because it's a matter of response effort to like you. I remember actually you want a way with people some words like some music festival or something. We're in Austin and like you packed all this food and like that seems like so much effort to me that I feel like it also does make like I don't know if I'm not necessarily listening to my Intuition or I'm just like doing what's easier.	
1	Yeah, well, I think that is a really good point and it still is intuitive because when we make certain decisions about what we eat, we're always weighing our values against each other. So in the moment if you like, what are you going to value with the decisions that you make around food? So are you valuing convenience and ease or are you on another situation or another day valuing like feeling good in your body or feeling like one day is it spontaneity? JT and then the next day. It's like Integrity because you told yourself you were going to you know, eat a certain way and so it's okay for those values to change on a day-to-day basis and you always need to check in with yourself again to figure out like what am I what value am I honoring with this decision around my food? Also. It's like we all just have we all have different values and different priorities and you know, I'm a chef. I'm somebody who loves to cook so I know you would always say like you're so not lazy. I actually think it's fun to make my own cashew milk and I enjoy the taste if you don't it's okay not to do all those things, but can you find you know, can you still find balance and challenge yourself to maybe step out of your comfort zone a little bit if you do prioritize your health and if you do want to take care of your body without it being like a chore because if it's a chore, you're just not going to do it ever or stick to it, right?	
2	There be no maintenance program for you if you're not enjoying it. Something that like again something you would mentioned was, you know, the dreading going to the gym like, oh my God, I have to go to this thing because this is you know, I need to move my body today. Like why don't you find something that you enjoy doing to move your body? Maybe you just go for a walk. Maybe you do like some gentle yoga on the mat just showing you do the monkey bars at the park. Yeah, right really swing on them recently.	
1	It's like really hard.	
2	It's Señor they were so easy. I can't even Swing from one ring to the next like at all and it used to be that it it's crazy how things change right because when you were little you were doing it because it was fun.	
1	Like as you just said Casey you did it because you got enjoyment out of it. You could probably play on the playground for hours because you were just enjoying the experience of moving in your body and today, you know diet culture guess who I'm conditioned reinforcer activity tivity. Yeah, like if you make something a chore if you make something if you take the Joy out of it. You're not going to want to do it. So if you absolutely hate doing CrossFit, but you think you should because it's trendy and everyone's doing it. You're not it's going to feel like a punishment. But if you decide that you just like biking outside and that's just your exercise and it makes you feel strong and empowered in your body and you love being outside just do that and you never have to actually do CrossFit again, and I guarantee you you will show up to that bike ride way more. Fluently than you would to that CrossFit class.	
2	Someone asked me on my Instagram or on actually Behavior bitches Instagram because I did the November motivate and move challenge because I really I find actual joy and moving my body. Like I know that when I go to the gym and work out with weights do things I actually feel a hundred times better. My anxiety is a hundred times better. It's not so when they said well, what's how do you find motivation? I'm like, it's more that I really just enjoy this. I'm not like having to look. Outside of myself to find the motivation the motivation is actually within me because of the way it makes me feel right the consequences that come after it during it also like I don't look at it as like to go to the gym. I look at it as like this is my time to show up for me and knowing that it's probably benefiting my body like not even physically of how I look but like internally like my heart muscle, you know, like things like that. It's so much more than just. Oh, I'm doing 50 squats and losing weight in my butt looks better like what about Internal organs your you know, everything that you don't really think about when you're thinking of oh, I have to go to the gym absolutely.	
1	Like there are so many positive benefits that we get from moving our bodies and the second you make exercise about either a punishment for something you ate or simply for the pursuit of weight loss. It just takes the fun away and if we just remove that from the equation and treated exercise as a celebration of what your body we can do in a celebration of having the ability to even move your body, which is also just a privilege in and of itself how would shift your relationship to movement like, what would you do differently? You know, I also see people thinking like we live in like the no pain no gain culture right where it's like people think that you need to feel depleted and exhausted and like you can't move after snack Orangetheory. Yeah, right like okay calling them out, but it's true. It's like Who made that rule like why can't exercise be something that energizes me and that I like just enjoy but then I can have enough energy for the rest of my day. So maybe I don't go off because of in hiring me.	
2	This is an adoring me because I feel guilty all the time that I don't like yoga. Okay, like I always feel guilty or like it's so good for your your lupus this and that blah blah blah like yoga like for your breathing and and like all this stuff. Duff and I like feel bad about it, but I really don't enjoy it like my natural movement. I want to do are things that are fast like boxing or you know, or I mean I can't do it as well as I used to like with my health things, but I just effing hate it like I really don't enjoy yoga. I'm so bored. There's 5 million other things I would rather be doing and I am just going to tell myself liad get the F over it you do not need to feel bad. Maybe that's not your workout.	
1	Right and so I would say for you lie out like it's going to be so you're not doing your body that much good. If you go to a yoga class and are miserable and bored and stressed out the whole time because your mind and your body are connected. You can't really like outsmart your body in the way that you think you can I would just encourage you to find the movement that you do enjoy and just do that and and you don't have to do the thing that you just think is good for you. If you hate it the whole time right like find the things that do make you feel good. You're much more likely to do those more frequently.	
2	Do you also think on the flip side and I'm just gonna yeah play devil's advocate here doing things that make you uncomfortable is you avoid them because there might be good for you. So like I've I love yoga. I also tend to not go to yoga when I have shit going on in my life that I don't want to face. Like I know when I go to yoga, I'm gonna have to like sit with myself and you know, I you know, and then I will instead when I'm you know, experiencing more stress or whatever. I might fill my time. With other things or in a cycle class where they're yelling at you I get it. You're so great Kick-Ass versus in yoga where it's like you're going to maybe you're gonna breathe here in this like pose for five, you know deep breaths and like maybe that's it. I mean, I know I don't make time for things like when my Apple watch goes off and tells me to breathe. I'm like, do you think I have three seconds to breathe right now fuck, you know, like like that which is pathetic like, I mean, that is all so pathetic, you know, it's like there's a difference between	
1	Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone and forcing yourself into something that's just not meant to be. Hmm. So I do believe it's up to the person to push themselves in a way where it still feels like overall. There's a positive benefit here, right? Because sometimes exercise does push us and it you don't always feel great and you should push yourself, but if you I truly think if you are tuned into yourself in a in a profound way. You can tell what's an exercise that is like comfortably pushing you to be better and stronger and something that's actually just going to hurt you or is just not right for your body. So again, it's up for each person to decide what what that is. I love that. I really love that.	
2	This is the case when you're right. Yeah, maybe maybe I don't like it to sit with myself. I'm not sure like I that is another interesting point, which I don't have to get into on the podcast but I do think like when I am under stimulated I think about my health issues more like that is something I've noticed like for example, like on Shabbat when I like can't use the phone. I like TriCity talk to people do this whatever it is. Like I start like feeling my ailments or like all the ways that my lupus Our dorm affects me whereas like when I'm distracted and busy, I don't think about it. Well, this was so insightful. Yeah. Well, thank you so much. It's so nice to see you. Also. I mean even though it's virtual.	
1	I know I'm loving it. I'm so glad you all enjoyed it and it's super interesting for me to hear about the connections with behavior because I do think there's like a primal element to intuitive eating that is hard to understand cognitively. But if you if you attach these behavioral principles that makes a lot more sense.	
2	The whole world makes sense of behavior. Yell.	
1	Do you want to be able to being learned a lot about that through living with liad as well? I think I became an apprentice.	
2	You see did I would talk about behavior all day, huh? She's like hey really reinforce this did I reinforce it Leah.	
1	I mean, yeah, and I would know when she was trying to pull her behavior tactics on me to she was not as sneaky as she thought but that's like I like the car.	
2	Out it was so great having you on today. I think a lot of people are going to benefit from this podcast because you know, especially coming up around the holidays and you just like it's always Indulgence Indulgence Indulgence and social eating and all this stuff. And so really just taking a second to just think about what your body wants is so important. So we appreciate your intelligent insight and your amazing energy.	
1	Thank you all both so much. I appreciate being able to talk about this. If you all and put it in a New Perspective, and I'm so glad it was insightful and that you learned and I learned to look at that in where maybe when you win.	
2	Yeah. Anyways guys thanks for tuning in go find us and as always love you mean it.
