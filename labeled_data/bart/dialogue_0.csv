2	Welcome back to the Lash base podcast today. We have a very different episode. It is our first interview. We have a very special guest is episode 19 and we are here with Sarah Fisher of Farnum eyelashes. Let's get started. So here we are then before I pass you over to Tara who are interviewing. I'm sat here as well with lash base Amy. We're going to be asking the questions. Hi. So we wanted to do interviews and speak to people that have been there done that and been in the industry for a long time. This is because I know you can listen to us talk and talk and give you all the Our advice but we thought we'd get someone that has even more experience and Give their views and their advice on how they feel the industry is what they like what they don't like and where it can improve as well. So that's where we wanted to go with this podcast. We're going to be doing more interviews as we move forward. However, we wanted to get someone very special very close to lash base believe it or not. I think she'll tell you in a minute, but I think she has been going for even longer. She's been in the industry for longer than lash basis even been around and we've been around for 10 years now, so Anyways, without further Ado our partial over so tarah tell us a little bit about yourself.	
1	Hi, I'm Tara Tara Fisher from Farnum eyelashes and based in South Farnham on the submarine Hampshire borders. I'm actually just entering into my 11th year of lashing. So I've been around a long time. I just also would like to say thank you to Jamie and to Amy for having me here this afternoon to record this podcast. You're very welcome Tara. I just want to ask you quickly before we get going. And how do you feel today? Because I remember when I first started it was completely nervous. And I'm really quite nervous. This is the first time I've done anything like this and like most people I expect I hate the sound of my own voice.	
2	You'll be fine. Jamie doesn't though I do as well. I Reggie, I record these podcasts and then I listen to myself back and I yeah, may I make a me listen to the podcast over and over but in all seriousness everybody hates the sound of their own voice and I'm sure you with 11 years experience you are gonna be able to provide so much value to people in this episode. So as you are already aware, we sent you some questions because we wanted you to be able to think about it. We didn't want to put you on the spot apart from the end of this episode when we give you the quick fire questions because I'll be interesting to find out what your thoughts. So what we want to do is be either the podcast is to provide as much value as possible to people that are listening. So I'm sure they'll be lots of people are interested in how on Earth you've managed to get through 11 years, and I'm sure we'll talk about it soon. In that your prices. Wow, and your diary as you know, because your you run it very full. So we're going to start with some questions and we'll get your take on it.	
1	Okay, Tara. So first of all, I just want to ask you when did you get started? I know you've just said that it's you coming into our 11th year, but but yeah, when did you start so I took my first course in October of 2009. Like I say I'm now entering into My 11th year, which is quite scary. I took a classic course then and then I did my volume training in 2014. And then my last game kind of really changed after that when I did some mentoring with Vicki rug in 2017, and I haven't looked back since what I find interesting actually.	
2	Sorry. I kind of I mean you were going to be asking some questions then can't help myself a I find it interesting. So you took your first course in 2009, right? Yes, okay, and then you went five years before doing volume. Can I ask you know, this isn't part of one of the questions I sent what were your reasons for having a five-year Gap or trying to master Classics or or what was your thinking behind it?	
1	I think I was just happy plodding along doing my Classics and volume wasn't really well-known of then and it it really wasn't a big thing then and all of a sudden in 2014. It had started to get big. So that's why I waited so long.	
2	So if you had to go like if you were starting fresh now, how what would your views be now? Because if you took classic and then it took five years to do volume, I get it that volume wasn't a thing. So that's a a reason. However, what are your views on either going straight into volume or is there what would you do now is basically more	
1	Should I think I think that if you've got the right trainer then going straight into volume is or can be a good idea and I've seen some really good results. Vicky ruggers talk straight to volume and some of our students have been amazing, but I do think that if you haven't got the right trainer or the right educator, then it could end in disaster on the flip side of that some students just get it and they just can produce fans straight off if They can then Classics is a really good base for them to start and I think once they've got the knowledge and the basics and they've got, you know, a good few months of Classics under their belt and they're competent enough isolation. And yeah, absolutely isolation attachment and just all of those things and I think and also just having the confidence in the work that they're producing then it's time to move on. Yeah. I come completely agree with you Tara and so moving on we just want to talk about Your first course. What was it? Like my first course was actually really really good. It was really in depth. We covered lots of health and safety.	
2	I've gotta say now. I'm going to just interrupt you and the so 11 years ago nearly 11 years ago. You took a course and it was in your opinion. It was actually good. I feel that is was that by luck or did you research how did you find a like what at the time because I know things change but at the time but how did you find a good course or if like a good trainer?	
1	I actually went off of a recommendation and I did do some research there weren't lots of training companies out there at the moment. I mean now there are hundreds of people out there training and it's really difficult to make that decision. But at the time there wasn't did you travel for your course? Did you go did yeah, I did it was about an hour and a half away and I think again some people don't want to travel by think you have to travel when I've trained with Vicki or other people in this country. I've traveled for two hours to get to them or maybe three hours.	
2	I think it's interesting. Now you're planning when you come into lashes or you want to do lashes. This is your career, isn't it? It so you're coming in and you want to hopefully have a successful career which will pay your bills put a roof over your head and do everything that you have dreams of doing yet. Some people say, oh I've got to travel for an hour. No, I don't think I'll fancy that it's the most serious and best investment you can make is researching and picking the right trainer and if that means traveling and that means traveling so my freely I fully agree with that.	
1	However, what I did learn 10 years ago is probably none of void. Now, if if I'd only ever taken one lash course, I would still be dipping with lots of glue. I'd be swiping. I've been doing all sorts of those awful things that we see sometimes we like God, please don't do that. But ever so much has changed in our industry certainly in the last couple of years The Styling is different the health and safety is different patch testing regulations are different the glue. Lose of progress so much even the lashes are different now.	
2	Well tell us tell us then 10 years ago because you are right. If you cannot is it you can't take a course and then just assume that that's it. You've completed it tell us at what lashes or what like what's up products or you using when you first learn bear in mind at the back it that 10 years ago. This was the right thing to do. But what what yeah, what were you using spaceborne around?	
1	He's quite embarrassing actually, but I mainly go East J's and bees they were loose lashes. Stop laughing. They were loose lashes and cover your ears. Everybody. They were in not point to and sometimes not .25. Have you got pictures of these you got evidence? I don't think that we actually have cameras back in those days the black and white TV. I did find some pictures for 2011 and they were they're pretty shocking to be quite honest wasn't the glue using almost like the consistency of Marmite as well. Yeah. It wasn't far off it to be caught. Honest, the Starling was kind of non-existent used to jump sizes and we used to sort of have a really long outers as well as they were terrible.	
2	I even remember that the and even now only because people buy like two different trays, but the only mixed raised you would buy would be into Mill increments wouldn't they? Because that was how you did the style and whereas now it is the one it's one we say 1 millimeter absolutely very interesting.	
1	Okay, so moving up how many Is have you actually taken out Tara? Because I know no it's quite a few and especially because you've been in the industry so long I have actually run out of space for certificates on my wall. So it's probably around 10 seconds.	
2	Sorry to interrupt you. I find it as this so funny. You will have definitely heard in the background a horn just go off the same thing happened last or a few days ago. When we recorded the last episode. We have a coffee van that comes around the business park where lash base HQ. Who is and we keep getting caught out by it, but because we don't like to have to re-record things we're really talking about. We just said it runs. So if you're listening to one of our podcast and you hit one of those horns in the background, that just means it's coffee time at Mash Bay.	
1	So when we listen to this pack, Jamie will also think that the coffee Vans here like you did last week. It was so funny.	
2	Sorry it sorry Doris and we were talking about how many courses that you've done.	
1	So like I said, I've just run out of room now on the walls for the certificates, but that includes Shops and kind of conferences conferences and those kind of things. So the main ones that I've done is I've done, you know, lots of mentoring with Vicky a couple of times just one-to-one mentoring with her with briony son. Some one-to-one mentoring went on a two day course with Maven when she came over to the UK which was kind of Advanced Styling done bridging courses and other kind of Advanced Techniques as well as like I say lat	
2	Of workshops. So how many how many like courses or mentoring sessions? Do you tend to have like a year now? Because obviously ten years is a long time you'd think surely you know it all or is that not the case?	
1	I don't ever think that we do know at all because the industry is changing and evolving so much. There's always something else to learn and you you're only as good as your last set of lashes, so I like to give myself a budget in the year. I can't say what it is. But I'd like to try and do some mentoring maybe one or two a year with people.	
2	Yeah, that's good. I think when we get around to talking about the prices of your sets of lashes will probably have a clearer idea of the size of budget that you probably have available. You will have to attend an event. Yeah, but the thing is these like lash events or group training or any of these sort of things. They're good for the I work inside of it anyway, so they hundred percent worth it just for the people that you meet and then the opportunities that come from the people that you meet because a lot of things that have happened to me in life are probably the same for utara is because you've put yourself out there you've gone to these events. You've met someone you've made a relationship your relationship and then you've had the opportunities like for example, we're all set here now recording a podcast because we've all met in person before and built relationships and Tap these events. So yeah, they are definitely important.	
1	Sorry forgot certainly agree with you on that on that front and getting out there and meeting new people especially for new girls starting out in the industry. I've made some lifelong friends, you know, not only with Amy and Jamie here, but and Julie obviously your mother but you know Vicki Joanna from flash last day on all those sorts of people that you know, we see each other and we support each other at events. I can't stress enough how good It is for the network and the Lash industry is quite a lonely industry as well. Especially if you're working on your own, so I totally agree with that getting out there and meeting people and you've kind of got someone to confined in a little bit as well. Haven't you thought the right word confine confide confide? Absolutely. I mean, we don't we don't typically have a staff room. So, you know during the day I can pop a message over to Rosie who's our new lash both Ambassador. She could plug she does my mom. Do you know but, you know, we can have a little talk. Something about styling or maybe a little moan about something and it's just nice that you've got someone in your industry who understands what you're going through completely agree.	
2	So that's like lash events and conferences in the group trainings and stuff. So that kind of leads on to our next question of like feet for you and I already know the answer but I think this will be helpful for people that are still on the fence.	
1	How important to you is continued learning all super important now I can say I don't think You ever know everything and and if you go on one course and you take away one piece of information from that then I think it's it's been valuable.	
2	Yeah, that's it was so moving on to something that I made a bit of a joke about but at the same time at the same time, it's not really a joke. We it's so serious that I think Amy, this is actually our most listen to podcast we did and it's maybe episode 2 or 3 was all about pricing and how to Raise your prices because there seems to be a problem in the industry and that is everyone's competing on how to like they'll start their past their course and they'll be qualified lash artist. And the first thing they do is look at their competition and go right I can see that you charge 50-pound. I'm going to charge 45-pound because that will help me get some get started and then I'll make sure that I raise my prices in the future and then what happens I don't raise their prices and then the next round of people that qualify go. I'll look I'll look at my competition. Titian all that person's charging 45 pounds. I'm going to charge 40 pounds and then before, you know, everyone's battle in to be the cheapest and in our opinion that we as a reason we did a whole episode on it, that should not be even a consideration the to compete on price. So I want to move on to talking about pricing with you and I know I laugh but so with with your prices firstly at like how do you charge because I know there are certain ways. By our or just by treatment and then how did you come about to that? Like, when did you make the change from one to the other? So would you mind telling us just a little bit about that?	
1	So I actually charge by the hour at the moment. I know that Jamie finds a hilarious but I charge 55 pounds an hour, which I know some of you will be really shocked at but when I first started doing lashes I charge by the treatment and I did that for eight years and it was only when I went on my Maven training and I'd learn all these Advanced Techniques and face studies and I was like, my diary was so busy and I was back to back with clients all the time and I kept thinking how am I going to implement all of this new stuff? I've learnt I'm just too busy. I need to do something. So it was at that point that I decided to stop doing classic lashes and that freed up my diary and what I did then was I then switch to charging by the hour. So my clients come to me for an infill they booked for an hour and that's 55 pounds. If they need some longer time. They can pre-book that with me, but they pay for that extra time. I think it's really important that People I mean when I first started I charge I think 65 or 70 pounds for a set of Classics. So I've never been really really cheap. I think you need to look at your hourly rates and work out how much you want to earn you take into consideration your outgoings and you really need to kind of work out the kind of client you want to attract as well.	
2	And when you made that change how like from either removed like getting rid of the classics. I remember Talking to you when you were doing this and you having to pass on your classic students and stuff like that. But when you change to the hourly prices and I know you've never been like low on your prices.	
1	Anyway, how many like clients did you lose that was early none didn't lose any so I gave my classic clients away. So a lot of girls that I've mentored or girls that I knew would locally in the area and some of the classics clients did actually Upgrades to volume really clever get them with a little hybrid switch over so that was quite good but I didn't lose any and how is your diary looking now? Then it's still busy. It's not as busy as it was. I think out of choice though, that is our choice. Now. I'm getting on a bit and I need I need some breaks and I do like to get to the gym a couple of Mornings in the week. Now, sometimes it goes out of kilter and the work-life balance real. Needs to kind of be reassessed and reset every now and again, but generally speaking my diary is good at the minute. It allows me to have afternoons where like this I can come up to lash post and do some work. Whereas before I would just say. No. I can't I'm too busy.	
2	So really your diary has is the way it is because you've decided that it's going to be that way. It's not a case of you've just scrambling around trying to find clients. It's you made that decision that you probably working me too much burning yourself out and said, Do you know what I need some time for me? I need time at the gym need time at the family and I want to be able to do other things one thing which we haven't touched on yet is the all of the workshops that you organize and host and things like that. So really is it decision that you sort of consciously made to slow your diary down but having the prices that you have means that you still get to continue living how you want to live.	
1	I think it's all about working smarter. You're absolutely right. I am still bringing in good. Money so earning good money, but I'd like to say I've now got a much better balance.	
2	Love it, right? Okay, so talking of balance what we're getting towards the end of this now before we do our quick fire round, but what is what are your plans for the future in the Lash industry?	
1	I've got lots of kind of ideas at the moment. I sometimes worry that I'm not pushing myself enough. I'm lots of people out there. They want to build a brand. They want to have a salon they want to become an educator, but it can be quite hard work and it is quite stressful. But at the minute I'm just I love doing the mentoring doing those little one to ones with the girls and helping them on their last Journeys. I'm looking forward to doing some more work with you guys over the next coming months and also just hosting other Educators. I love all I was in those workshops. I've got one coming up this weekend with lashes on flick by Lou, which we're going to be learning the kind of wispy and YC look so going to be looking at doing more of those and I have said I'm going to enter a couple of competitions as well. Do you find that is pushing yourself out your comfort zone totally. Yeah. I entered a competition about nine years ago when I was first started and I haven't done another one since I think I was just so busy building my business, but Now I've got some space in my diary. It allows me to have the time to maybe do a four-hour set and do proper competition set with all of the training and the workshops and stuff that I've been on. I've just did a workshop as well with Vicki last weekend on how not to suck a competition, which is another plant. However, oh my goodness. It was amazing how to take the right photos how to choose the right model really interesting Vicky.	
2	You're probably going to listen to this is as you're clearly paying. Laura do you plan to plug this?	
1	I did say I might name dropper once or twice.	
2	Okay, so last question then before we move on to the more more lighthearted quick fire round and where we hopefully can catch you out put you on the spot a little bit but last serious question one thing that you think is missing from the industry right now.	
1	The main thing that I think is missing is regulations. And I don't just mean for people becoming eyelash artists or ought to become Educators, but it just seems really popular at the moment for people to start their own lash brand. There are people ordering stuff from China and Korea popping their own label on that and selling things on the market. That hasn't been tested. We don't know whether they conform to EU regulations. It's yeah, it's really frustrating to see that I you know, I I tend to buy my products from Reputable suppliers and like yourself, you know, I know how rigorous your testing can be on the lashes and the cleansers and all those sorts of things that we're producing is I don't think you'll be alone with that one as well stays quite a big one.	
2	If not something that I'm going to dig into myself right now because I think everybody knows my opinion on it and it's one of the definitely it's one of the unique shouldn't be unique about lash base, but weirdly it is one of the unique things about lash base that seriousness and The that we put on to testing on to regulations and making sure that everything that we're doing is safe and compliant. But yeah with you I think it's crazy and a bit scary how many people are doing it like a rightly or wrongly again. I've mentioned this before in a previous episode likes you either don't know or you don't care because a lot of the people start on these Brands their lash artists and they obviously then want to it's easy enough to Source things from China and Korea. It wants, you know, and what a or why or how would they know what testings involved when the person in China's gerner? We'll just stick a label on it for you and you can sell it is completely fine. We promise why would they know but the episodes like this people like you talking about it and when we I know it's hard for lash base to openly talk about it because it can look like we're potentially trying to push our own products, which is not the case. I think once we get more of this out Out there people will start asking more questions and hopefully these changes can be made and then that moves into companies if they now listen to this understand this and then don't make any changes don't do anything. That means they don't care and they're the ones that I think are massive worry with this. So yeah, great Point ARA and quite a serious one to end on especially considering we are now going to move in so quickly change up really quickly. We're going to go for some quick fire questions tire. So are you ready? For us to give you two options and you have to pick your zombie head are looks very worried.	
1	But I'm ready, right?	
2	Okay. So first question Amy, do you wanna do the first one? Right? Okay.	
1	I think we all know the answer to this first one but ready. Yep. Classical volume volume premades love or hate love good clear or black adhesive black. Okay favorite tweezer. I'm gonna say dumont's It's 20 mil. Yes or no.	
2	No, no point to is yes or no? No, right. I'm going to speed this up now to I feel like you've had it too easy, right? So straight to volume. Yes or no. Yes Mega volume yes or no. No LBX or the premium mink range LBX. Should you need volume certification for premades? Yes, can you get lashes wet within 24 hours? Yes or no? Yes patch testing. Yes or no. Yes brow lamination. Yes or no? No, you did really? Well, that was good, right? Okay, so I'll do it for the quick fire round. We're going to end the podcast there because it has been long enough. Thank you very much Tara for coming in and giving us your time. We're going to try and do as many interviews as we can. It's always good when we can get people to come down to the Lash.
