1	I bet you've listened to a podcast and thought I can do that. Well, I can do better. Well, you can anchor is a free podcast tool. It's an app. You can post a podcast to anywhere. We use anchor to send our podcast out to Apple iTunes Spotify Google podcast and many others do it all from one place. You see stats all from one place. It's actually pretty awesome and it's free. It's your turn to try find anchor in the app store or go to Ankara. FM to get started good luck our land and here it is. We are one day from free agency. It's Saturday about noon Central Time and we're just waiting. It's basically Christmas Eve. We wanted to catch you guys up on all the latest news and we wanted to wait and do our free agency primer right before things went down. So it would be as relevant as possible on this podcast this episode. We're going to talk about what we consider the top. Free agents the top the first Domino's as it were we're going to go deep dive on the fits the possibilities we hear a lot of great content, but we don't hear every possibility or close to every possibility. We don't want any surprises. We want to at least have thought about player a two-team be Landon were about 30 hours from when everything kicks off.	
3	How do you feel well, as always I can't wait for all these intricate deals to happen 30 seconds after the deadline starts because tampering is just something they have so technically they have the pasta so they have the ability to punish teams. They don't like so if they're not liking what the Lakers are doing, they can just say o you tampered so we find you 500,000 which is nothing but every one tampers. It's only a selectively enforce.	
1	And makes for a funny the tamper thing is so weird because it seems so subjective. And as you said free agency starts for us at five central tomorrow. But I think it's been well underway for a while.	
3	Yeah, it's assumed that it starts at the earliest around the All-Star break with especially for these stars because they're meeting other stars on the big teams. They're talking and technically players can be can be mediums between a front office and a player and it's legal. But unless it's like the prophet says hey go talk to if Jeanie Buss and Robb Flynn could tell LeBron. Hey go talk to fly about coming here.	
1	LeBron can openly just talked to quite about coming to La they can't do anything because it's just player chatter but that's just used as a mass to legally tamper and now soak in Magic apparently y'all probably all read that story and it's really interesting that Co I would ask to meet with magic and Jenny bus at the same time, but my guess is they'll be having dinner somewhere in Los Angeles tonight, and I'm excited for magic to go back to being magic. I think he's getting a hard time right now. And he should not have quit like that, but people get stressed and they do things like that. And I think we'll see from here on out magic going back to just talking and tweet whoever he wants to. The first Domino is kowai. Kowai. I would say if you pushed me and we were just talking about last season is the best player in the NBA. He's a free agent and he's healthy going to the next season. So he is the first Domino to fall we thought for a long time. There's a lot said about how we don't know anything about him. And in his case people aren't putting anything out as agent. It's really an us Uncle Dennis who's always been kind of framed as a kind of a Wildcard Moore's learned about him recently that maybe he's not and you know what? I didn't like the way it went down in San Antonio. But after they won that Championship land and tell me what you think. If he spent his whole career in San Antonio and even if they did win more Rings, he was always going to be a product of San Antonio and now although I didn't love how everything went down. We've seen way worse and there's two sides to every story. He promptly went to Toronto not his first choice stayed healthy is a good teammate and obviously is the reason they won an NBA championship that narrative for him is a little different and looking back on it. I don't If that wasn't the right move for him.	
3	Well at the time I thought trying to force your way out seem to weird fit, especially because the Spurs have been so good for so long and they really made him what he was because she was always defensive Force but they worked on his shooting his offense to where he became maybe the best two-way player. I really think the dysfunction between him and the front office came down to his injury because there are a lot of reports that this team doctors said he was okay, but quite himself wasn't confident in his ability to stay healthy and he got other Options that said it's risky. So in a way it's kind of like what happened to Durant where the where the team said you're okay and the player like Durant's it drain chose to come back because it's the finals he wanted to lay everything on the line, but for quiet was come back in the middle of the season when they're a bottom half playoff team in at the time. You didn't have a new contract. So he's just resting his long-term health for what for a maybe a chance out of playoff push and especially because it was such a weird injury. Because obviously he fell Zaza pachulia his foot and then he re-aggravated and he couldn't play and theme is slowly working his way back up. So I think for him is a it was the smart move to consider as long-term health over the short-term success.	
1	You said that San Antonio basically made him the great player that he is and I think that might be true but he's a greater greater player outside of San Antonio and think my point was thinking maybe he did want to move past that shadow of their development and just kind of what they've been able to do and I think long term it might be it might be a positive thing for him and his legacy is a player because he obviously was excellent in Toronto. And now he's gonna go either stay in Toronto or he's going to go to one of the LA teams and he has solidified himself as sort of his own player. I think through that and we've seen players be worse and just I think it's been watered down. Maybe it's a championship and whenever there's some drama whether it's in basketball were it's in my real life. I look at what people have done before the situation and what they do after before that situation Kawhi Leonard was a model NBA player. Our model teammate and then he's been that in the in the year after so it's going to be really interesting to see down the road kind of how this affects his legacy, but I think it's going to be positive. It's interesting how we can look at something one way and then just 12 months later things can look almost totally different. So I think we've all thought it's the Clippers or the Raptors. The Lakers have a real shot at him don't they and I think people read between the lines Brian when horse always says, well, I know at one point he did not want to play with LeBron, but I don't know if that means now nobody says anything quiet is like the Patriots. There are no leaks. So Landon, do you think the Lakers obviously financially they have what they need to do. They have a shot at talking him into to the next big three	
3	Well, I believe the reports that have been coming out recently in the past couple of days, especially from Marc Stein that if he is to leave Toronto that the Lakers actually have a better shot than the Clippers of getting him. Well, I don't think I think he's likely to stay in Toronto at least on a one-on-one deal where you can try and win one more ring than reconsider. They certainly have the opportunity because obviously he gets to go to La he just to play with the big three there. If he goes there there they're probably odds on Bears. They're easily that they are now that the Warriors are crippled, but the only thing is like we said we don't know anything about Kauai and what he wants and what is Camp ones and what means the most to him. So we don't know if money matters if being the guy matters of winning matters if relevance Matters by Guess was and we'll find out tomorrow what matters to him but until now he's not saying anything because he never says anything.	
1	I don't want another big three. I don't want to go through what we just went through with golden state where they're just the presume favorite until injury. I knew they weren't going to win one until somebody left or there was a catastrophic injury. They just had that much talent and that's what's happened. I don't want to go through that again. I think it especially on the Lakers and I don't want the Lakers do it again after just being buffoons for 10 years giving Kobe that money when he was done and just all the Timothy mozgov and all they don't deserve it. Yeah in a way it would be interesting to see how they fit but I want a wide-open NBA. I want seven teams that could legitimately win it. That's what I want. And I think that's good for the game, you know in ways that would be good. But I like the idea of him going to a 48 win Clippers team with excellent role players really smart Executives and coaches and kind of seeing what goes there but is is co why I worry read that they're going to have a big 3. Anyways, they're going to get Jimmy Butler if they don't get him and he's not going to be able to beat them. This is quite think like that. Is it is it one of those things where it kind of forces his hand now that Anthony Davis is there and then they have they have a third max pot. Is it is it a situation where he feels forced because I think the guy wants to can you continue to win he doesn't want to go to La and be second fiddle and there's a threat of that you mentioned the one in one with the I know people say oh, what about the money would rise injury history. We need to understand the top five players in this league if they get even a really bad injury like Kevin Durant. They're still going to get Max money. It's so naive. I hear people that do this for a living say well, what about Cadiz and every team in the NBA would give Kevin direct Kevin Grant a four-year max. If they could they'd every single one of them. You need to understand that stars. There's no better proof Stars win championships than what qua did. Did well-run teams with good depth smart teams, they add up if they add a star that can win a championship. Okay exhibit a the Raptors this year. So Kauai unless something awful awful awful happened to him. He could do that one on one and I hear people say well maybe the 101 is the new for the league now. I don't know just the top players because it even like Kimba is like him are going to get his money. He's not doing one-on-one because he's a he's a short, you know already.	
3	For seven years is like but LeBron Durant Durant and maybe quiets really July guys who at the time they hit free agency are the best in the league and they can do what I want because they have the security to exactly so I want people to understand that.	
1	Yeah quasi flexibility. Katie says that flexibility, but that's you know, you can't go too far down the list but don't mistake that God forbid something could happen to Kauai if he doesn't want on one this year and he could have the same injury the Katie. He doesn't guess what? He's still going to get a Max after that. It's just the facts. So that being said, I don't want the Lakers to get him. It seems like the Clippers sort of lead presumably to slipping seems like you think you might go back to Toronto.	
3	I think so just makes so much sense for him because he's the hero of the entire country as a chance to go back to back and then he probably becomes the greatest Raptor ever. They have they have the team to contend because especially now that the Warriors I like Don't lose Durant's. There's really no one else. I would take over this Raptors team because obviously I think they lose if Duran is fully healthy, but that team that Warriors team doesn't exist anymore. And Qui will probably be healthy this whole playoff run because he was heard the last to see the last two series. He was still great. They have the death. They have the Stars to compliment them and they've shown that they really like to manage his load. They'll just let him play 55 games or so and he'll be super rested where he can go all out only in the playoffs when it's necessary.	
1	I think it's a good point and I really thought it was going to La I just really thought he was even after the Championship. But Toronto, I've heard all their aging. Okay, the guys are aging on that team Marcus Soul. Sandbox Serge, Ibaka, Kyle Lowry and Kyle Lowry the contribution they got from those guys was to the point where they could expect to get that next year. It's not like they had to have Marcus hold down the stretch to win those games now. He was huge for them and maybe to get in that position. Yes. I'm just saying.	
2	when flee	
1	Kauai siakam, those guys aren't going anywhere. I felt like that was the bread and butter. Everybody else was just really right place right time and I would expect the same contribution for those guys next year. So I think he's got a really tough decision here. They have a really good shot to go back to back. That would be incredible. I think he'd take that when you get it and I'm telling you the Clippers if he signs a one-on-one they will have Max cap. Next summer and even if something happens to gets injured, they will still offer to him next summer. So they don't people always do what we think they're going to and that Lakers thing. I'm done being surprised. I don't know why you would do that. This guy is good enough to win championships in his own right if I were giving percentages, I would say split between equally at this point between Toronto maybe a slight advantage to Toronto LA Clippers in then I like a 25% chance that he goes to La. What do you think?	
3	I think it's probably 55 Toronto. 30 Lakers and 15 Clippers just because I've seen so many sources that now the LA team that's the FrontRunner for quiets the Lakers not the Clippers. And I'm on ready to give bit and there's this one user who has credible sources within the Lakers organization. He called Paul George sang a couple years ago among other news and he's said that the organization the organization really believes that they have a really good shot at quad that they have a better shot in the Clippers. Obviously. This is just some guy on the internet, but he's got a track record of being right. So there's just so much news saying that now it's the Lakers of jumped in front of La teams that the failure to give them	
1	it's gonna be really interesting. When do you think we'll know when what's your prediction on one? Cause going to make this decision?	
3	I think his decision will be if it's not I think you'll end up being Tuesday or so because unless he decides at the at the start of free agency because he's not expected to take his last meeting with the team which is the Raptors. He's not expected to do it until during the week after the deadline. So unless he's already certain on what he feels about the Raptors he's just checking with the LA teams. If you believe that he's going to take that meeting still then he's not going to you're not going to decide immediately and that's going to shape that's going to shake things up because the Lakers are going to have to wait the Clippers are going to have to wait the whole league is going to have to wait and see what he does before they can really make major moves.	
1	All right. So II Domino to fall is KD and just like a why my thoughts on where he's headed have changed in the last week. What teams is Katie meeting with I know he's going to be with 14th, right?	
3	Yeah, what are those 40s he's going to need with the Warriors because they can off the five-year Max but in that doesn't seem likely but I still knobs and just because I kind of money they'll usually let him rest and recover on their dime. Then they come back and they likely have the same big for that. They started this run with. The Knicks obviously, I believe the Nets and the clippers because I don't really know if the Lakers would want to sign him just because they're in Window mode right now. They've got LeBron for two more years at least and Durant is going to miss this whole next season for sure. So if they sign them, I don't see why they would want to rather than take a lesser Max God because they want to win now because you could wait a year and then you have Durant LeBron and Davis, but he's not going to With and he's not meeting that's that's also thing. They don't want and he doesn't want him that he doesn't want them.	
1	He's going to be with the Clippers the Knicks and Nets and Warriors. And you know for the last year, I've thought he was going to team up with Qui with the Clippers. It just made so much sense and the way they set that team up. I think they just like the idea of going to La but not like yours and beating up on LeBron and I just didn't see the Knicks thing. I just didn't think that they have the credibility with players right now. They don't have the infrastructure. It just seems so obvious like it did to me in the previous year seems obvious to me that LeBron was heading to the Lakers. Well that entry changed a lot and I still think that might happen because the Clippers could bring on Kauai. And still trade gone, awry and bring on Durant. He could sit a year. Obviously he's going to have to and they still would be very competitiveness Q so it's not off the table and I thought literally there was zero percent chance that he was going to re-sign with the warriors with that injury. Number one and how things played out number two and number three the Lakers getting Davis along with LeBron and now are going to have some form of a big three it looks like They could all get back together the Warriors the four of them and whatever they were moving forward is not this stacked team based on too much money in 16 and this aberration. It's not going to be like that because if he goes somewhere else he's gonna have to contend with the Lakers. All that being said because of this injury and how they've reacted and I think they would offer him the five-year Max. I really do and just pay a half a billion dollars over time and luxury tax. I really think they're prepared to do that. The leader for me is the Warriors. What do you think?	
3	And I understand where you're coming from size to the he gets easily the most money he can he can recover in a year where they're not expected to really contend because play is Polly atmosphere as well. So it's really maybe we pushed for a Bottom seed and Clay comes back and when you try and get a little momentum going into the next season and obviously the Warriors like the fans the whole organization loves him a lot more because he sacrificed his health to try and help them when he won. Game for them by see the Nets is more of a I like the Nets more just because it seems like he and Kyrie are interested in teaming up. He can certainly also rest on that team and its really Kyrie takes over for danjela Russell's position Durant comes in and it's really just all it's pretty much the team that we saw last year that couldn't quite content with Philadelphia, but now they have Kyrie and in the next season, you've got Durant coming back.	
1	You know, I've not really seen that whole him teaming up with curry thing, but it's a very possible and it looks like it'd be the Nets over the next which I really appreciate from players now because the Knicks are a joke and I don't care what kind of hallowed gym they play in or whatever. I would not trust that ownership and that for an office with my future for anything and I think we've learned that competent for novices can help you win a championship. So maybe I just don't think he's going to go to to Brooklyn or New York because I wouldn't because I don't see it to me. He's got two excellent choices. He can return to Golden State or he can go to the Clippers if Kauai indeed heads there but that is a third possibility. I wouldn't trust Kyrie and I just don't know what kind of Rome they can be. Obviously next year. That's a wash and then from there obviously the Nets have built it the right way in a short amount of time. They're very competent in the front office. It coach what percentage chance if you had to give it to you think the Nets wind up with with Kyrie and Katie, I'd give it a 20 percent chance of snow just because I see I see the Warriors and Clippers as definitely.	
3	As definitely favorable destinations for Durant's and maybe this whole friendship with Kyrie and he wants to team up thing is overblown. But it's still a very realistic possibility for book for Brooklyn. I'm happy for the fans after they had to go through all those years of sucking and not having their picks and now it looks like they're going to get Kyrie and maybe another guy.	
1	Yeah, I like it for their fans to but think of it like this and I would think Katie who's seems like an intelligent guy and risk Lyman is Agent aren't they thinking? Okay two years we come back. Kauai is either on a really good Toronto team or on a really good Clippers team. There's some form of big three in LA and even two seasons from now. I think I think LeBron still going to be a force to deal with obviously Davis. Okay is Korat is is Kyrie Katie and Dinwiddie and those guys who are really like. I mean are they going to be in that conversation? This is a guy who's been in the finals. The last three years it C. Is he going to be okay with I mean, there's possibly they could be an afterthought there.	
3	Does it doesn't it too much of a risk?	
1	I guess is what I'm saying. He can go to the first two places the Clippers or The Warriors and be right in the thick of this he's going to risk with the Nets who by no fault of who's running it now have not been relevant for a long time really ever except for some Jason Kidd years. He's going to I am carry the most combustible like Mercurial star in the NBA.	
2	Isn't that too much of a risk for him?	
3	It kind of is risk obviously, but the same time if we're assuming that Kauai leaves next year all these continues that you mentioned are in the west and they're in the East and I was we've seen over the past couple of use if you're worried about teams on in the other conference when you're trying to get files pushed you shouldn't have because that's after three playoff series and injuries. We never know what can happen. So the Warriors first year love gets hurt early in the playoffs and Kyrie gets hurt and goes from over the cash. So probably the favorites to be the worst of the Warriors are just going to be a lot better than the next year. Curry wasn't quite a hundred percent bogey got up bug. It was out for this out for the series you could dial was crippled and then we then the Cavs are able to come back then this year obviously the ran in clay at go out and Raptors handle business and that's a good point.	
1	And I know it's a long way from Who You'd face in the finals, but don't they think big picture though? I mean don't they think like is this an Enough. That's why I think keeps them from going there. I think at the end of the day. I think he's going to stay in gold state. I would not have said that at all two weeks ago, but the thing about the NBA with so many free AIDS and so many of our best players as free agents now things shift quickly and if thinks Things fall, right, I think I think you might just stay we know he loves San Francisco.	
3	I'd rather risk.	
1	Bad then going across the country and getting in bed with Kyrie Irving. Maybe that's just me.	
3	Maybe I'm projecting if you stays with the Warriors, that's because they fell short and he got injured he wasn't able to prove himself and he and he wants to come back and show that it's not just Curry steamed and he jumped on to make it unbeatable that he's a significant part in he's why they win.	
1	So let's Circle back a little bit. Kauai is taking a fourth visit himself. He's gonna visit the Knicks. We didn't mention that should we there's no chance, right?	
3	I think it's just kind of seeing what does Dunya due diligence England goes around and maybe he's just This feels weird because it's Kauai but maybe just enjoys going out to dinner and being catered to as a superstar.	
1	I don't think so. But I think it could be part of that due process as you're saying for whatever reason he's giving them that respect. But who knows but I think it's a big it's a three-team race. Alright, so the next Domino to fall is we've talked about a lot Kyrie. So let's say Kauai ends up in Toronto or the Clippers Katie ends up with the with what we can do two different scenarios. I guess it's a Yeah, I don't know is is Kyrie's totally dependent on what Katie does?	
3	I don't really think she seems like he really is just going to do what he wants to do independently because it seems like Brooklyn is the favor right now. Obviously, they extended to calling a qualifying offer Daniel Russel just because they needed to but it really looks like he's going to Brooklyn obviously Boston the door is probably shut on that so after and I don't really think he chooses and they started the nuts anyway, so the his really is only other option I think would be the Lakers. Which would be weird because he wanted he tried to force his way out to get away from LeBron to be his own guy. And now he's going to the Lakers and he'd be the third guy by a good margin after LeBron and Davis.	
1	So we see this sometimes in sportswear guys. They they take a beating for the personality. So like especially in the age of social media. It's like they get made fun of they get looked at is kind of toxic and a locker room and they go somewhere and they really work to iron that out right or and they learn from the hard truth. The thing about Kyrie Irving is I don't know that he has the awareness to do that and he's behavior on social media so far this summer. I don't think he gets it. I really don't he is an excellent player and in a certain situation, he could be he could do really well. I just saw LeBron Pat him on the head so many times when they when they played when he went to Boston and emasculate him a lot from body language standpoint. I think he part of him wants to go be that third Max star in alongside LeBron and Anthony Davis and others in Space Jam 2. You can tell with his ego. That's that's what he would really like to do. I don't know though, if his ego would let him do that. I think if it doesn't work out with Brooklyn and Katie his obvious choice, I think he might consider it but some these dominoes would have to fall. He he's kind of hard to predict because he's an unpredictable Personality. Yeah, it looks like Brooklyn or maybe the Knicks or wherever Katie wants him to go, but I would not absolutely rule out the Lakers thing. So beyond those three, are there any other possibilities for Perry?	
3	All right things so just because he's such a polarizing player and it seems I do have the cap space to give him the max that he would want other. They don't need a point guard. They don't want him on their team and they're chasing bigger fish. Like the Clippers have a Max they can sign Kyrie, but they only want to yeah, they'll need that guy on their team. No, I don't think so.	
1	So, yeah, it's probably those three. Let's say Katie goes to Golden State. What's your most? prediction for for Kyrie at that point	
3	I think if you can team up with Durant long-term, I think he ends up going to he goes to the Lakers because you've got F because with kg and Kauai off the table, I think Kyrie is probably the best reagent the Lakers can hope for and he certainly fits with their three got the three got the through the only three guys they have on their roster right now.	
1	Yeah, he's a fit on the Concorde. Anyways, if it yeah. All right, that's going to be really interesting to see me. Does if my prediction is riding Katie shocks us all and stays in Golden State. Wow, that would be an interesting narrative see him back in Los Angeles or see him in Los Angeles back with LeBron, but looks like it might be Brooklyn either with with or without Katie that's going to be obviously that's why we're so excited. The next Domino to fall is Jimmy Butler who's had some injury issues. But you know, if you watch the playoffs you see this guy, he's a playoff minute guy. He's a say you can win you big games guy. He's a self-made player and he's got some left in the tank before for a long while I thought he was going to be they were going to clear a room and he would be the third guy in for the Lakers if that happens. Let's say well, what's the bit on the court with he and LeBron and and Anthony Davis?	
3	Well, I think I think he has stood a certainly pretty good because obviously LeBrons defense. Mainly from a lack of effort is nowhere near what it once was obviously Anthony Davis is a good is a great defender Jimmy Butler when he's not trying to force his way off the team like he's done twice and a bit over two years is a great defender.	
2	He's he's he's a good ball handler.	
3	He can shoot from outside and he's shown that he can play with other ball dominant Stars. He had to play with Ben Simmons and Joel embiid, so it's not going to be question of LeBrons get the ball a lot. Once again the ball a lot. He knows what he's getting into if he goes Lakers.	
1	So what are the possibilities for Jimmy? Let's list them all as we go down the line. There will be more possibilities. I think for these guys. We've heard a lot about Houston in the kind of gymnastics that would take for Houston to talk Philly into taking guys or other teams. I don't buy them as a legitimate candidate for jamming.	
3	Do you know because it's really it's either they somehow moved. Capella Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker. All three are good role players safe it around Chris Paul and James Harden. They remove all three two other teams without taking any salary back somehow or they convince Philly that they're going to loot that that Billy is going to lose Jimmy Butler either way, so they should do a sign-and-trade and they'll get back lie, goren and Tucker and they get something back. It's really just it just looks like Houston is trying to play mind. Into the Philly because I don't see why right it Philly things Jimmy Butler's going to leave. Why would they just let them while they helped send them the Houston.	
1	I think Daryl Morey is not afraid to mix things up and put other put players on his team on notice. And I think he's only hell are you now, we'll see maybe there's something to it. I stranger things have happened. Well, I just think Billy has better options than that if he leaves I think Jimmy Butler has better options enough.	
3	Yeah, if Jimmy Butler lie still he can just use the money they could spend on them to sign a couple role players to fill out next to the been seventies and bead that's not like, oh we have to get the star back because otherwise we're already over the Cap'n	
2	we just	
3	it's like Rory over the cap when we just have to keep him somehow.	
1	Yeah, I just think it's made for an interesting story in this kind of quiet period before the storm I could be wrong, but I don't see it. Jimmy could go to the Lakers. Jimmy could stay in Philly, honestly. There's a weird dynamic between him and Ben Simmons. But if they all come back they have a good shot to win NBA championship. I'd say better than any of them probably do well maybe if he goes to the Lakers, but he Harris Redick they were a bounce of a ball from maybe winning another one. I mean for maybe being the NBA champions themselves, we never know but don't you think it'd be smart from the just running back, right?	
3	Yeah, I would just I would just run it back. It's like you said that push the Champions to the brink and that was with and bead knowing you're being healthy. And obviously that's a interesting caveat to put because obviously in bead is going to have problems staying healthy for all of his career. So it's not like we can say, oh it was a fluke use injured this one year. He's going to be back healthy next season. They're going to easily beat Toronto. But if they have just a 10% better and bead Or just a guy can just a backup center who can't be awful and I would like be nine is nine and two minutes or whatever. They have a shot. Right?	
1	We'll see that's going to be interesting. So Jimmy could go to Philly. You could go to the Lakers. He might really want up in Houston. What are the other possibilities for gaming?	
3	I think Brooklyn if they still get Calgary and they strike out on Durant. I think he does make sense. And obviously they take it away from Philly. So that that slows another continue to that. They're trying to they're trying to be better than I think it's a be a bit of a risk on Brooklyn's part because they've spent so long building this team on the ground up. They've been developing this team culture and they throw Kyrie. He's just a he's just a weirdo and then Jimmy Butler who when things aren't going well takes the third stringers and beats the stars and starts. Screaming stuff at the stars and fights his way out of a team.	
2	Okay.	
1	So whoa judge reported less than two hours ago Kauai and Kevin Durant were talking about playing together. And that was my prediction all last year. They were going to go to the Clippers together that would make sense from playstyle and from a culture and role players and everything and I think we might see that prediction come come in and I and I think I might give them the slight Edge even for Kawhi over Toronto because it just makes too much sense, and I think people have not talked about that, but if you just Logically at the writing on the wall. Like we said earlier Kauai can handle that team and make them, you know a final possibility next year without Katie and then they'll come back and get KT. So, you know, I know what you think about lotion will adjust the ultimate you read the tea leaves on I got someone lots of people tell him whatever should they emerge as the favorite for both of them?	
2	well	
3	I don't know. I don't think for both of them. Like I'm starting to buy it though. I really am I'm starting to believe that's going to happen II I can certainly see it happening. It makes a lot of sense in if they're talking they say like if Y is talking to render and tells them hey you go to the Clippers. I'll go to the Clippers. That's probably the best destination for Quad because they're they're especially in the west because the Warriors aren't going to be a threat this year and then the Lakers are Then get a top top guy. You could maybe come out of the West with out there and then next year. You got the two best guy in the playoffs by far.	
1	I don't know just just everybody keep that in your mind. I think that hasn't been talked about but boy wouldn't that make a lot of sense?	
3	It'd be really interesting because then you've got the clit in two years. You got the clippers, but they're two stars. You've got the Lakers with a big three and you've probably got the warriors with their original big three all in this one little egg it be in the same building and in the same state.	
1	I think it would be maybe a best possible scenario for for the league because the East setting to go anywhere and they're still you know, it's still going to have you honest. Another you know, there will be other contenders, but that would water it down enough to where it would be. I'd be really really interesting for me. Especially next year before Katie Got Back. All right. So any other possibilities for Jimmy any wild cards for Jimmy?	
3	I don't think so because he clearly still wants to win you must be competitive. That's why he forced his way out of Minnesota and it's and so like the really only other option is the Knicks and they're not going to be competitive unless they get to unless you get him in and then Max guys smell something they are so the next have the money but they're not good enough.	
1	So my predictions to this point and my prediction is Jimmy to the Lakers and my prediction is Kyrie by himself in Brooklyn. Or or the necks in my prediction now, you know is the big to as it were Kauai and Durant with the Clippers. Okay, so obviously that's subject to a lot but if I have to you have to nail me down. Those are my predictions right now. So what's your bottom line prediction on Jimmy? I think if I were him I'd go back to Philly but I think we may see him in purple and go I think you I think you stays in Philly.	
3	Because good Vincent's he's a he's a good player two can play maker but he's not a score and bead is the center. He doesn't need the ball a time, even though he has a high usage rate. So he goes to Philly. He can be the lead ball him there. You can be the main outside score.	
1	So Klay Thompson has no chance of being anything but it goes a warrior for the next four years right very often the five for 190 Max, which really, he was a few votes away from getting the supermax, which they probably would have given him too. But since he wasn't all-nba third team, he didn't you didn't get there but I think that's just a done deal Clay is the kind of guy that she's just seems loyal and he's going to work his way back and he's the kind of guy I would bet on kt22 be back and almost as good as ever. And they're going to have to sit out this next year as a contender possible most likely and then they'll be back in two years and that kind of makes the narrative even more interesting. So we all we all know that with Clay but he needs to be mentioned because he is a very viable player and if you did have an idea even injured if you want to go somewhere, I think there would be a lot of talk about him too. But he's just a gay. He's just a different guy.	
3	That's such a clay for agency decision.	
2	Where	
3	Where we just hear? Oh, yeah, he's coming back and we immediately know and it was it was done the moment. He knew he tore his ACL he's coming back. There's nothing to report about he's back. Right?	
1	So we've heard so much in the last two days about Kemba Walker to Boston and makes their draft make a little bit more sense. I actually like to move better than that a lot of people because you look at what brass Steven has done with a normal personality smaller. Kind of ball dominant guard. I think they'll do some really interesting stuff. They'll run. Everyone has talked about it. What are they going to do it Center we're going to do is Center. Honestly how many good teams have just kind of made it work at its Center centers are the new safeties and tight ends and running backs in the NFL. You can get a good one for like 5 million bucks. You can just find a good one and they did that with Aron Baynes who was really one Aron Baynes and when he was healthy, he was kind of what they needed. So I think they'll use their 4.8 million dollars. Exception to find whoever they can after everything blows over there are ten or twelve decent or better centers and I think they're not worrying about it. And so the butcher big thing I thought was dumb because if they got Bucher big, how are they going to find a good guard for five million bucks? They're not but the other is true now they going to get a great Center. No, but they will they get somebody. Yeah, and then they'll just run small and run is the right word because Try to get these Wings back go and they'll try to get Hayward going and I think even with Walker Walkers usage will go down but his efficiency was really good the best player that he's played with his land and everybody talked about how it was somebody else but door-to-door lamb is kind of underrated but man, that's all he's had. So I think with the coaching and they're all going to be hungry to reprove themselves. That's going to be a 50-win team that's going to be a third or fourth seed in the East I really think and but my first question are you about canva is is it a done deal? You think there's any chance he doesn't go to Boston at this point. We've been shocked and we've been we've been surprised about this kind of thing before he is and then he isn't it feels very very close to a done deal.	
3	Obviously. They he can't technically say it's a dungeon. Otherwise as probably getting into the tampering area but just makes a lot of sense because he right now they're only point guard on their roster if they don't bring bacteria Rozier as Brad Wanamaker, So he has a clear and obvious dominant role. They've got a bunch of wings to cover for his defense. They've got a bunch of good shoes to open up the floor from Brad Stevens. Like you said is good with his archetype of playing is really his only other fit is probably Dallas maybe like they're technically leaving their they're almost maxed slot open for Kimba if he wants to come there but looks like they're in contention proud Horford. So it really just feels like Kimba. The Boston is the closest thing to a done deal. We have after clay going back to Golden State.	
1	We're to talk about Al Horford in a later episode very soon. And I'm really interested to talk about the Fallout of that Kimball would have other options even to be the third guy in LA and obviously Dallas, but it looks like he's picked Boston and I see the fit absolutely why people say was that get them over blah blah. Hey and people talk about Kim's defense. He's not a great defender because its size. He is not a negative Defender. He's he's never says he's pretty yeah, so I think he fits really well looks like he's gonna he will wind up in Boston. We have that on pretty good authority. Unless something crazy happens. What do you think their ceiling is or what your expectations for the next year?	
3	I think they'll be a around a 51 team. I think they'll be a for the three or four C depending on people using who goes from these top teams because Kaiser spilling Toronto is currently constructed. They're better than Boston even yes, then I still like Milwaukee but then Kyrie is certainly a better player than Walker but Walker's character is leadership and his ability to not poison a locker room is going to make this team a lot better. Even if they're going to have to patch up the defense of hole left by Al Horford just because it's not going to be as their star. Is it going to be unhappy and poisoning the chemistry?	
1	Yeah. Yes. Nothing if it's out against Horford because I think the guys terrific obviously hope to wanted to be there but his agent found out that someone was going to offer him, you know for years twenty eight million dollars. I mean, you're 33 years old you take that and we're going to talk about that later, but that's I don't think it was some culture problem or anything with what with Boston they just they're just not going to offer him that and I wouldn't either I really like Al Horford, but that's a lot of money and he's 33 So somebody's desperate sounds like it might be Dallas or Sacramento, but honestly with the Kimba thing moving forward, I'm a little higher on that the most people do I think they're going to miss so we win a championship. No, but I think they're going to be right back in the mix and be really interesting. We're going to talk about we're going to pretty much going to go down the line give you the same analysis. And as far as the other dominoes everybody else so stay tuned to us. We're going to go down the line and get you ready for tomorrow.
