Okay guys back to our lesson. How to accelerate your English learning hey everyone. My name is Braden Chase and welcome to the podcast. It's nice to talk to you guys today today. I wanted to talk about this idea. How do you accelerate your English language learning? A lot of you have been studying for a long time and you've been in classes you've been in school. You've been with books. You've traveled you've done a bunch of different things and it's been a lot of work for you, but you need To kind of move forward right? What are we trying to do? How do we accelerate in what we're doing now with accelerate. There's two different things that we can do that we want to talk about one. So let's say we're at a particular level and we want to get past that we want to go up and improve our English Okay. So there's a particular technique that I'm going to talk about that can help you increase or improve your English. Okay on the other side. Sometimes we want to expand our English. We need to improve The the breadth of our vocabulary right widen our vocabulary so that we can talk about more things and I have one technique that can actually help you do both but not exactly at the same time and I'll explain how that works. But first, let me tell you guys a story about me actually. So when I was learning Portuguese, I lived in Brazil and I moved down to Brazil and I did not know anything about Portuguese. I had not ever heard Portuguese. To know what it sounded like I didn't know who spoke it or where Portugal was even though I wasn't going to Portugal right was going to Brazil and do nothing. It was terrible and I get down into Brazil and I'm like woohoo, let's go to the school. So I went to the school and they start talking to me and teaching things. Nothing makes sense. I had a meltdown in there. I was crying. I was frustrated very hard couldn't understand anything until I kind of had a switch and I said, well what if I do it this other way, so I started going this other way and focusing in my Different way of learning and teaching that I do now for all of you and going in that different direction. I was able to improve very very quickly. Okay. I went from knowing absolutely nothing in English. Hey knowing absolutely nothing it in Portuguese. Sorry to being able to hold conversations with Native Brazilians who had no experience with Americans and actually being able to communicate I could understand them and they could Me okay within two or three months. Okay, if you look at the text books, if you look at the universities, they tell you this is not possible, but I did it and not just me. I know tens of thousands of other people who have done this Hello nice to see you. Lots of people have done this. Okay, it's not magical. It's not unique anyone any anybody can do this if you follow the right steps. Okay, so in short the way you do this. Hey James nice to see you on. Here the way you learn English faster though. You improve your English faster is through Focus. Now. What is focus? Let me tell you a story. So you guys can understand how this Focus thing works when I was learning Portuguese at the time. I was in a particular area and that was one a particular physical area, of course, but I was working inside of vocabulary Reptar on religion. So that's what I talked about and I focused in that The gin and that vocabulary and as I spoke and spoke and spoke within those words my English got very my Portuguese got very good in that area. Now. If you moved me out of that area usual, my Portuguese was terrible. Do you want me to talk about cars or to talk about politics and suddenly it was terrible and I couldn't even hold a conversation but inside of my little world of religion, I could hold really good conversations and explain things and given instructions and talk and have these conversations that were really Advanced. Okay as a very very possible to do this K. And that's what I mean by Focus being inside of one area and advancing through that area. Hey Ang nice to see you but be focusing in one area learn that vocabulary that's used in that area. Learn the grammar that's in that area. Learn the writing in that area. Learn the the listening the way that people speak in that area focus on those areas. As and that helps you go from this level to clear up here very very quickly. Okay, focusing in a particular area helps you learn faster. Okay, do not try especially as adults right? Do not try and learn a little bit here and a little bit there in a little bit here and a little bit there. It will take you forever to learn anything. Okay. Forever don't do it. Right and if you look at the text books that what they do, right? Here's a chapter on animals and here's a chapter on jobs. And here's a chapter on geology and a chapter on this and they take you through these little tiny tidbits, right? And that's part of why it takes you six years or 10 years to learn English because you're focusing on these little tiny bits If instead you focus on one area and you focus and Work and just accelerate your English and everything inside of just that area. You will learn how to speak English fluently very quickly, right? You'll reach a high proficiency and advanced Proficiency in that area in months instead of years. Hey Lori nice to see you. So that's what I need you guys to do right focus on that focus on one specific area. Now the same tip also works right? Let's say you are really good at that one area you focused. Tan, I don't know geology say you're a geologist right you work with rocks and volcanoes or something like that. So you focus on your area. You become really good in your area. But you got to talk about other stuff too, right? You need to expand. What do we do since you've already accelerated in you have high skill in that one area. It's very easy for you to go. Step aside, right? And then all of that knowledge comes with you into the new area and then you focus and develop that new area and then oh, I need to learn say space now or astronomy or something dude step across right build that area and you can bring all of that knowledge those two areas now come with you and instead of trying to build this little tiny base has a million different things. You can focus on one Tower and build these towers across and learn much much faster. Oh good. Thank you, Lori, I'm glad you like that. So that's my tip for tonight guys the way to accelerate your English learning is to focus on one thing especially as adults right for children. There's actually different teaching techniques and how they learn and that little spacing. My little bits of knowledge of things over time is very helpful for children, but for adults it slows you down right do not do things that way focus on one area specialize in it and Step aside and specialize in your next one your brain works better. That way you learn better. Everybody's happier. Everything's faster. Okay. Thank you guys, if that was helpful for you put a like underneath or put a comment underneath. I'd love to talk to you guys. I know that some of my best conversations have happened actually after I turn off the conversation or turn off the video here, so have a wonderful night and I'll talk to you guys another day. Bye.
