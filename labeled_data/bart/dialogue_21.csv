And luckily but as always let us start by letting say C'est La Vie. I had potential to avoid huge are so that's a I've been stock Nation so far. We've done like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars from adds itself. So Stop missionary journey every time I'll be awake a plan. He has away streamlining things into training. I'm trying to push the ladder up in Indian market key. Let's just give them everything basic for free and let's take them to the level Javed burki Western Society of example, the Russell bouncing would know what sales funnels copyright and paid you have a loogie Robbie blogging patio. And then you know, it was promises are being Give me a block when I look at you when buying a organic organic pay at Kevin, you know, seop bought Focus, right?

What kind of work is it possible with the help of that? So robots Arif, I doubt they'll still see people don't understand this correctly. So that's the journey by Body retail me, but I ovulate greatly anymore, but I hate anybody so guys, I mean, I hope you got a lot of	
2	Motivation inspiration bought a great journey. It has been from Omegle to stock Nation. You must have seen the transition which happened Garwin a bot. That is you scary. But now it's all about strategizing and how you take it Forward how you scale things up and that's everything's in front of you guys. I mean you just have to go and take action. So go to bed before you move forward in detail topics, you know open let's talk about something about you, you know, so there's a question about what people ask is what something people seem to misunderstand about Garmadon.	
1	People seem to think that you know only to affiliate marketing, but but that's not true. I am a full-fledged marketer and a geek marketer analytics with I said put it in the numbers numbers, you know. Is very fresh cut down real time traffic Lake that I found that I see so apart from affiliate marketing of I do a lot of other stuff as well. Not only misconception people have but of course, I do affiliate marketing and I'm good at it.	
2	And of course by though by and you know every day wake up, right and you as Ikea Gob Gob Caray was cup corn rows motivation mirror I can see you know, you feel inspired. So what makes you do that what makes you go and what is your why what makes you hired to do everything everything what you do honestly are bloody difficult or diagrammatic.	
1	I'm Goin all inspirational Nicola pengelly, but but but you know what, I see on social media like, you know, let's say sort of started with me and Rahul by a game after you know, I'll send and he's doing so well go somehow I feel like you know, there is a lot of things which we can do online since these guys have done it big make it big already made it big and it's happening but of Is the bug is doing so well, so I just come to Facebook. I see these people hustling and it gives me motivation kill. I should also hustle and I come back and I fight for it.	
2	Correct way, of course every Market here needs to go to social media, of course those sub K and everything everyone goes and everyone sees people like you people like, you know deeper can all pick guys and then they're doing good because we know that K of mechanization what's keeping, you know, we are not those guys who judge people you Harriet. Oh overnight success, you know, we know that See, what's the journey what went behind building what you today? You know, it took around 7 years 10 years to build an overnight success. So we know that you know where we everyone came from right? Exactly. Okay. So by other, you know other everything goes away any if you have to start everything from scratch or up cook agency should watch corneal, you know up that may happen is your name a you have tested everything up to do a lot of things. But now you know when you start everything from scratch, what will be your game gun?	
1	But what I would do is go online marketing is a game of building assets to get Hua Casa quiz music like is it was a crappy email list as it was at the Facebook Community acidosis textbook of fan page Instagram page. Okay, LinkedIn profile anything anything which you know, whatever it takes just one thing and you know make it so make Kitt little bit bigger or so big that it becomes noticeable and appreciable by others ticket to go in case it become girl up Arab name is Edgar Liana above nap could feel my body is okay. So that is the only game nothing else.	
2	Could we be excused for Pro or a square said Bernardo and keep working on it, you know don't be consistent with whatever you are picking. So I grew up or try new things, you know, people use motivation. They think you know bus passes are there by next Esa oo isnt even better is attained then they don't move.	
1	It's late. So maybe but at least you still cannot become stronger.	
2	Yes.	
1	Yes. So what people do is people see it as a small term game. He become Gaara and you know, we as being youngsters, we want money in immediate returns. That's how we see things but that's not how life works the opcode ever know that I would tell you money would definitely come but through our strategic approach case. Our first me something bigger should get the results. They get up early career occupies results have a name. Mmm, even if we were doing for free, it's absolutely fine. But but up results the car key. You can attract a lot of people. Okay. So that is the main game if you can attract maybe influencers maybe clients, maybe maybe maybe anybody who is ready to buy even a case study from you since you've done it good and made it bigger. OK Google X starting with random house already here the result overcome grow and don't think equal result. It's me give you a second example. Let's say make now I am somebody who Woman named Esther day. Once they get their gear please men told me I'm stuck they say so yeah, of course, did you summon me very quickly of question mentorship, nrega up Cuca Hotel optional technibond pieces of mentorship in electrical current Vice. Commander should go up right now casting me he would also like to include the show notes. Maybe they get at because of being a single and army is not able to you know, Do the shorts on time or whatever so you reached out to current high in you say that I would do the show notes for you for absolutely you don't have to you know, this is a prophecy problem. I see Keno. This can make your podcast spider and I'm ready to help you for absolutely free when start helping current. Hi. Okay, then what will happen is after they say two or three shows then you can say to Karen that as we go along. Can you also Mentor me as well? You know now see when you have helped that person. Not in terms of you know, giving them money or giving them sales or something like that, but if built a relation right you have right now the leverage to ask for help. Okay. So now when you ask somebody to Mentor you the the person is going to be ready to do it so find the problem of the one whom you're going to looking to get mental then help them and solve that problem and build a long-term relationship.	
2	Great. I think this is the best way to go, you know view add value to the person first and then you ask something. You know what Gary Vee says As you know the first do something for them and then ask whatever you are. Your requirement is from the from the person right so great in size 5 grade in size. So by other DMC weapon Measure 3, so schedule bharath. Oh, I still laugh at the video which you recorded with moon is fine. You know when you arrived in Mumbai, it's good idea that people who want to become great email. Could be a white. What is your take on this? You know, what are people doing wrong? And you know, what are the strategies which you personally use when you create your email. I mean JBLM email-based. So to up can make sure Kentucky is a Jose and you know, I think people listening after this bone buyer 10 lakh database for 90 bucks.	
1	So Bailey is to yeah, but people think of email marketing is he people say email marketing is that that's the first men's misconception. They have email is very beyond from dead. Okay, so it's not going to be dead any time soon don't send your is there and everything is there but that they move more mobile, you know, and he is still a desktop feeling in some places obviously people read from mobile as well. So the way I craft emails us even has certain things certain aspects. Their first thing is of course the subject line so subject line the objective of doing the subject line of curiosity driven subject line or something, which is so beneficial. Is to make the person just open the email that's the only a of your, you know, email email subject line, then post that you know, I always try to what I would do is I would come up with something something in the form of an angle. Whatever I want to say. I would not say Okay God of this is iPhone go take it and by okay, I would not do this. What I would do is I would always try to come up with an idol. So now always remember whatever the source of the list is Okay, for example, let's see many videos kill list of stock Mission me whenever I'm going to put a product. I'm going to give it a video angle and Link it to my product itself. He came up with social media marketing signal that I've built a list out of that to emit. Boom. Get up go. You know, let's say you have poor social media marketing major issue a a great social media marketing, but man must and look I've got a case study which is going to actually help you master that correct. So always try to find it angle inside your email. And also what you can do is you can link it up with your movie with with recent happenings from your life. For example, right now. I was in a movie I was watching Joker, right? So now I can link it up tomorrow in the tomorrow's in will if I want to promote something I would probably end up linking Joker and my product now because I did this, you know, last time I did it was the subject line of my email was Google bone.	
2	Remember, I remember that	
1	I remember that email so deep linking with movies or your life happenings or just go to go to websites like BuzzFeed and stuff like that and link your headline with their headlines, you know, you could do a lot of Wonders with their for that. So that's another part email third part of the email. What I tend to do is I think so now depending on whether I'm selling or whether I am, you know, I want them to click and go to the next step. I've graphed my email. If my objective is to make the people go to the next page and just click it. So I'm going to the email short and crispy. Okay, whereas if my objective is that people should be, you know pre nurtured and once they go to the page, they should buy they should pick up the wallet and you know claiming money then of course, I'm going to put some more effort into my email you some storytelling, you know, do some pre pre nurturing kind of stuff and then benefits at in detail. If possible, we'll talk about the bonuses. Tell them how they will look at the bonuses talk about the refund guarantee. So my sometimes emails would also go like little bigger. You know what Jen will would not do those big of females other than the pack. I have not seen anybody else doing that good of marketing. So so that is what I tend to do these things and now a quick little tip, which I can give you an email marketing is that in the footer of your email, you know include the links of all Your products now every time you're going to mail somebody even if it is not going to you know, take that action, whatever action you want them to take some many times people would go to the Footers in click on the links and they'll buy your products.	
2	So if I click the browse, you know, just what what what is all about so they browse the thing and then you can put a remarketing code on that CC then you can pretty much get them on Facebook as well.	
1	Absolutely and just not remarketing you generally make sales is out of that as well. For example Russell does a pretty well if you see click funnels put a film on the life, correct? These a little bit of things which I think so would be helpful for people and please don't buy an email list. It's always of money trains to put that put that money into Facebook ads and then you don't build a list out of it or Google ads and build a list out of it and then you know sell it sell it to them.	
2	Correct. I mean, why do by a furious then? They say Kira could be anywhere. You know have studied MBA or it has 30 BBS. So they just look at this through and either motor, you know, a awareness interest desire desire and action model which is not daughters in college degree or or they understand it as you know, parents are both akiza from Chico chance out there, you know, what turned out there. So now I know that you are the one who introduced me the power of funnels, you know, when I see you can I saw your webinar sounded fun Discovery Bad Kitty and you're talking, you know High I traffic some image of But I gotta take on your finals. So what according to you is a funnel, you know that people should understand and not take it as their internal sense, you know, either or would you better say so and why every person on the internet needs to have one if they have to succeed in online marketing also if you can provide some actionable tips and quick takeaways which they can do and apply today and which will help them to create everything funnels. You open a banana and they can make money by this keep as you too. So how you do it. I mean, what is the funnel? I mean, okay, so	
1	This is a group of questions actually had a dissected one by one. So Bailey geez, what is a funnel? Let's define that let's understand funnel or that so generally your other people would think that taking the person to the page and then completing the sale is a funnel actually okay are generating that lead is a funnel but that's not funny. So well is actually a you could say a group of pages and multiple steps combined together finally ended. Oh, sorry, Jesus at the a depending on what kind of funnel you're making for example start right starting from the ad okay ad copy your right to the end where the customer is actually his actually become evangelists for your brand and he started promoting you on other books. So it's May the way we look at at look at it is like a customer value Journey. Okay. It's cool customer value Genesis our watches some lettuce or text just like Ryan deiss puts it so one customer value Journey abzug research coordinator. None, what happens is they are stages of every human being in your brand or towards you. Okay? So the very first stages like when they are least aware about you. So first step of the entire vacuum reading that awareness. Okay, once you create the awareness in that funnel, so awareness could be with the help of a video could be help of with the help of something, you know, which you're giving them value or anything on social media. They just read a post about from from you in a group and then they Gotta Wear about you things of those sort. Okay. So then once you've done that awareness days, then we go with about you know, turning that Prospect like person whose was whose aware of a brand now into a lie into a lead character. So I've seen a lot of people trying to sell directly of course selling director also works. Okay direct selling ads have been popular from like long long time, but then happens is conversions would be lesser. But where is to First generate a lead? And build a relationship with them by providing more value of friend. Like let's say you doing you doing a I'm doing a lead magnet, but I'm not just start to lead magnet of social media marketing course. I have a sequence now in my sequence. I share my story I ask them to introduce themselves to me. I'm getting like almost 50 200 emails a day, which I read and which I reply to just because you know these people reply back to me and then I'm also giving them tools free tools then further, you know taking their paths from just from email. You to my Facebook group showing them my face and live video was you know, and then building a relationship there right then. So these this is the step where what I'm doing is after General like first was aware step then is the lead capturing step. And now what I'm doing and nurturing those leads. Okay, I just told you the way to nurture is through even you know, right now current by is nurturing you with the help of this podcast, right? So now you mr. Then once you have their trust, you know, trust is mmm Most undervalued thing actually, yes, but it's the most valued thing to be honest. So what you have the trust of people, you know, I can tell you the names from my email list of people whom I have been trusted by and they have been on my list for and a half years five years and they still buy from me, you know, once you get that trust once you get that trust rolling, then you build a long-term business with the help of that. So now We built it. Now you start selling tripwire you build a binary relationship starts with into your main offer. Then comes the backend of then comes the high ticket offer. Then comes the evangelism, you know, so these are series of steps which are part of the funnel to be honest.	
2	Okay.	
1	So now that's I hope now everybody has understood. What is the funnel funnel is not just a series of pages is beyond that Beyond it's a yacht, you know, it's kind of an ocean itself.	
2	You know, it's Five against a a service or a industry itself within digital marketing, you know, absolutely correct. Now people would generally think of you know, front end out human of grade 1 upgrade to this is a funnel Less Fun and that's not final that's just like defects in the series of pages which you are, you know, taking the person through with our website say, you know up knee WordPress websites reconstructed exactly exactly.	
1	So now obviously as current said that everybody should have at least one funnel and to be honest, I'm telling you you just one fun. Oh away from your success. Yeah, we funnel crackly Anna though windows are up. Malama Raja. Yoga hundred social media marketing course, I make 3 rupees back up front. So obviously I love cars but I have a series of 17 products which people go through one by one take a jumbo Jus. Just it requires skill. I have options. I have Instagram or Facebook. I have lead lead generation were made by step. Well, then I'll go to full core of msf already today. I have copywriting masterclass. I have this one is Workshop. So I have couple of other things as well as stick there and then, you know, even beyond that are being we have not really made this program, but now we may further. Going to one-on-one coaching where people would be paying minimum of 1 lakh rupees because that's like the amount of money which is required for well to sustain that particular, you know justify that time which is being devoted ha. So these are just different kinds of things. So people, you know, spending 1 1 rupee like you spending one rupee on the are you making three of these back your grade since then similarly I do for every one rupee in stock Mission funnel $1 rather I make $2 back. It's like 100% return which is The Upfront return. So beyond that, of course, you know, once you do relationship building, once you start selling other affiliate products and everything was way and Beyond so this is just the upfront value. So, you know, you should definitely make a funnel and if if you're not succeeding at your very first final don't worry about it and how to build a funnel is altogether a different aspect of X.	
2	It's a different story altogether.	
1	So but all I would say is, you know, depending depending on your business type up cuz it's like a business here are post types. If another classic example, if you're in real estate popular lead generation cuff on Allah lead nursing cover launched a site visit be up to include one cipo to make sure keymap email follow-up say your SMS Hallows Eve and they go sign by the site visit carrados, correct? So that's that's like the crazy funnel and then our up if you are into it's a digital course is and you need to go change then you need to shower cap cover. the ladder getting a stronger as a group like a product selector a clock here after EQ or give out at the Koenigsegg Agera for the productivity of cooking e totally dig it's as simple as that absolute value like the Rock and as the person passes through different steps and as he keeps on building more trust in keeps becoming more successful if you keep selling him more and more because ultimately everybody wants to go from A to B, right you are the person who's more successful than men then take I'm from A to B and then B to C and then C to D and then so on right so that's the part I and you know, if they're like any other if you are into any other particular zone or any other particular industry depending on the or industry, you can even run direct selling ads for example stock mission is all done from direct selling ads. It's nowhere to be magnet in between correct. It's because of the value of the offer though. What is the offer is really when you look Kevin live really great a problem solver. It will sell automatically for example I've been called a local Eco maker of the not generation first, of course directly. So Harper up basement come here Doctrine Investments. Only, let's say $15 $20 or maybe like let's add best $45 right order to happen.

So what have we are moving ahead and you know, someone question is there if you could have dinner, you know, if you could have dinner with any three people dead or alive, who would it be and why?	
1	Okay, so having a dinner, of course, that means I have not had a dinner with them so far, right so for so for my own expiration the people I look up to as one of them is of course Russell Brunson second person is Ryan deiss and third person not a lot of people know him. But his name is Android chapter on and he's like an amazing marketer or even like, you know end of chapter. Paula said garden and I am a huge Garden fan. If I got said you'd save got like having a devil is all together when we go against chair a chair pass the ketchup got him go if I could just have his 30 seconds on a call. I would be so thankful to God, of course.	
2	It's safe to I heard her be marketed mean each other because he's such a great person. Correct. So great Guru my great-great. So you're going to buy one more thing. What do you fear the most?	
1	Okay, so I used to fear a lot. Yeah earlier in my earlier days that you know when I when we were starting up but if you know, let's say if our business is based on Facebook. What if tomorrow Facebook closes takes a decision to close the groups and my group goes down. Okay. So all these kind of feels used to earlier be there. But then now what will happen is we've Diversified in a manner even if the one arm or One Wing goes down the the second one is always So that is why even an email list we have so now I have to autoresponders I pay for to autoresponders just in case one goes down. Hi. I'm not you know handicap because now it's when I chose which one of those I'm using active campaign at the moment and I'm using moose and moose and yeah motion is an alternative like it's like a backup for me. Okay, great.	
2	Okay.	
1	So if you feel if you are fearful of something just make sure you find pollution you find find an alternative you diversify and you know, you should not be fearful anymore.	
2	Of course, my dirty are cheap. It came out in Tucson. But there are still individuals looking for tactics no tricks and shortcuts to make money from this amazing part of the internet marketing. So, you know say they are they are being either scan by someone who says key you can make this money fast and you know say people lose interest in affiliate marketing and they if the potential income behind so according to you, what are the five steps you would give to our audience of five tips, you know, we'll be listening to this so they don't resort to a set of people who Sell this Internet dream of shortcuts to make money with affiliate marketing like reading systems automating cash and you know, terms like that. So what do you think on this?	
1	So first of all, you know, what we need to understand like a collective if it has to be five points I make it may not be exactly five. But I'll try to make it five. Okay. So step number one is understand you need a product to sell a product which is in the time. Okay, and demand can be checked with Google Trends. It can be checked on quora it can be On Twitter, it can be checked on Amazon as well. If you know in that Niche there is something selling second thing. If once you found a product, of course now, you need people to buy that product, right? So you need to hunt those people online or offline. You can even do you know if like, let's say my mom wants to buy something in a mesh, which is digital marketing. She was alone. So I will give an affiliate link of you know, let's say somebody's courses and to my mom and my I'll make money out of it, of course, you know. This is to be somebody so you need to find the people who want to buy it's not just that, you know, it's only online world. You can only find it them in online world. You can also find them in half lengthwise, but it online is here because you know, you have various targeting options available today. We have inaudible earlier a little bit about later that evening. He also find the buyers now. Up buyers name a problem. You really immediate buyers name is their ticket but first interesting look measure their so that is what you will indicate when you get double of the having interest in let's say buying an iPad but they're not going to buy instantaneously. Now those you need to third thing which you need to do is you need to have a process to pursue to not pursue about what would be the word to actually yeah to to make them by that particular product to add. Actually have your words turn them into action takers and make them by. Okay. So so now you go ahead and with the help of your copywriting skills the benefits over features, you know, trying to tell them using different marketing strategies trying to tell them benefits and trying to make persuade that person to actually purchase that particular product.	
2	Okay.	
1	So that is the third step now once they have purchased something from you, of course that means Trust you now, they have developed a relationship with you cry and incentivize them, you know for the purchase. Let's say if I purchase something from your linked track me a boon in return. Okay, correct. So that's like the first step because what what it will do is it will make an impression in their mind that every time I buy something online I could get additional bonuses if I buy from gaara's blink, you know or it well, it's better if I'm let's say I'm thinking of buying I've got today or any other platform activecampaign then might as well, you know, I should go to Gaara. When asked if he has some bonuses I met her I might get some done for you lead magnets. If I buy from his swing. Yeah, it kind of makes that we each kind of puts you in the person's head in terms of your brand value that you're going to give something extra then. Okay, then what you need to do is if you have find a process of If you find a process a process which ever you have been doing and if you're able to if you've been able to let's say find ten buyers through that process. So then you better scale the fuck out of it. Okay? Okay, but what I've seen is people people would definitely make money but then they would not scape for some reason they scared to scale it up. So now don't be you know scared of losing money since it's a business we might as well sometimes lose money. I lose money all the time like for example yesterday. A day I lost 25,000 rupees on on Facebook ads. So what I made it back today.	
2	Okay.	
1	What if I lose if I try to scale if I go all and what will happen, you know, I'll have no life has its own way and humans have it have its own way of adaptation. So we're going to obviously find the right way smart people with smart creatures. So these are the five simple steps. You know, these are the simplest steps I could put them in.	
2	And I think so stick to the process scale it up and then you know after that look for another process to diversify things because they're not not go to the people, you know, it's a Kia to our you know, we give you some system and then you just go and you make money out of that.	
1	So that's bullshit people, you know fall for yeah who you are tell us maybe, you know, you'll be you'll be making some money just like a lame duck company could afford nickels. Are there were some company.	
2	And you have to answer that within five seconds and then some you can take some time. And after that we get to the final topic of Facebook ads. That's what about the you know, we'll do that so ready for the way ready ready go t get soba logo or gurugram by go anytime go get Facebook ads.	
1	Facebook ads for now active campaign affiliate marketing and worst advice. I will generally take advice from a lot of people. So this is hard one. So was too dry. It is portrayed by supposed advice. Yeah, so worst advice which I have received which may I may have done as well in the past hiring friends in my company.	
2	So you say you're you're two failures till now which allowed you to learn and move forward.	
1	Okay, so I love failures long list of failures. They say Pella failure jota is because for example, I started geeko Tech blog Dakota accompaniment, of course, but blog should have written almost 150 blogs on that particular blog and what happened is even one of them received crazy amount of traffic with Google SEO Sookie. What's up cube with our blog Malika, but then I you know, I was not making money. So what i is the biggest failure was running the block for one and a half years and not making a penny out of it. Right but then it gave me the skills. I learned from it and then I moved forward right second thing what has been a failure. So, you know first my first product launch, which was in Warrior plus, you know in the Internationals well, Failure, so it actually gave me the importance of understanding the finances doing my calculus right and looking for partners, which are also at the same level. So it gave me an insight into the partnership out of it and your two success stories.	
2	You're so happy about you wish to party.	
1	Yeah, so first is of course start Mission, so it was a dream. Of course. It is still a dream do touch seven figures with the ads but even six years not seen anybody in my space doing it very very very few people. Literally I can count on my fingers in one hand, right? So so that is why it is like it reserves a party second thing which I did is I recently bought a home. So I've not got the key get congratulations. Thank you, sir. Good luck easy. So but as soon as I get the keys, I'm surely going to party because that deserves a moment for me.	
2	Right? Of course, of course bought seven Karina to your Sakai dream of her kissing her dream of every person on the planet has that cream and when they're fully I mean, of course you have to party great going. So go away your most favorite book ever Everett.	
1	All right, so it is what is marketing. What is marketing by Seth Godin? So read that book. Everybody should read that book. Anybody who's a marketer should read that book of course dear great sort of ice.	
2	We answered all the questions successfully and we have the gas part which is the boss, you know, the boss second comes up. So let's talk about something which made Mark Zuckerberg beginner and is still making him and us rich which is Facebook ads. Yeah. And so, how do you define the modern day of the Facebook ad super honest when we kept fill the Facebook Yorker today, it was direct, you know people used to buy things on Facebook. We got when you know ads varies from Facebook to use forget never neetha, but you know people now jump to Facebook ads without strategizing or knowing their objectives, you know, so if you had to start, you know building a campaign. So how do you go about start to finish? I mean, you don't need to give in detail just an overview and so how do you how you go forward with it?	
1	Okay. So Facebook ads EO Pele, who are Cathay I still Remember Perry bottles on Ava II would just the worst creative on the internet when then I will get the leads in the series. Okay, but how no more things happen like that because brands have evolved a lot of competition has come forward bidding has increased so rates have gone up so we have to be strategic about it. Now. The the first thing which I would do is for anything anything I do even an email or an ad or a page switch that I I would try	
2	To look for the hook or the angle we call it. Okay.	
1	What is the angle which I am going to do? Even before I start building my campaign. I would start thinking in my head, you know? Okay. What is the angle? I am going to sell to the audience? What are the different angles or I can try so as long as you know, I'm not clear about my hook. I would not really proceed but I whatever who comes to my mind, I'll put it on paper. Okay, I'll put it in my notes on my whatever and then I'll pay I'll start building around. Like in second thing which I would do is now so far I've seen, you know, I've been running an ad of four people. I mean the same person showing a journey of that person from Zero to Hero for my social media marketing course, but now what I feel is what I feel is if you want to talk about creative sense today when in advertising, I think so, you know, if you have the budget to do it you should do something extremely amazing and Innovative example, what? Take that moon is courses this time, you know, I was a kind doing the copy and the sales copy and also the you know parts and parcel of connecting with other people. So the way we try to do it this time was we made the sales video a rap video, correct?	
2	Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's an amazing unique concept which happened, you know, no one no one even expected the Boca but it came out very unique exactly.	
1	So so if you have the budget to do it, then I would always think of a creative crosses and try to bring up bring something and aspect which has never been done before earlier in the industry in your industry and if people are looking at it, but you're going to grab attention and it is going to actually make it go viral reduce your cost also give you extra customers without any pain, right and so and gives you a lot of brand value as well. When you do these kind of campaigns you might as well end up speaking at stages because of that one simple Campaign, which moon is also got a chance to speak it as well. All right. So so what I feel do that creative part, if you cannot do you know, if you if you have budget limitations and you can't go above and beyond then what I would do is I would simply you know, do a basic minimum video and I'll try to make it a social give it a social angle to it or not social angle, but rather have those those letterboxing above and beyond the video try to make it a little bit attractive or everybody's doing colorful things. You do black and white, you know. Try to stand walk in that in that particular feed so that your cost per mile decreases CPM decreases your CPC decreases your sympathetic decreases. It helps you write that stuff. Then then what I would do is I would not really, you know, stop at doing Facebook ads like that. What I tend to do is I tend to go deeper into my funnel and optimize it for maximum profit. Okay. Generally, what I would do is first slot by would put up a chat. Into my on my page make sure I have a two-way communication with people even a toll-free number is positive then I would go ahead and further, you know in at the back end of the funnel. I would see what kind of different products I can put to the people who are bringing who are coming into the final then, you know, what kind of lead generation process I'm going to follow how many sequences are going to be triggered to that person because it takes over to the manual manual Zone where I manually mean, you know broadcasting my emails so I would build that path for that. Person in a manner that my lifetime value of a customer is already optimized without having me to worry about The Upfront cost. Let's say even if the CP was up tomorrow by 2x. Okay, but if I have my system in place at the back end if my backup from this strong I can still outbid the biggest of advertisers on Facebook. Okay. So that is where Facebook ad is not just about the advertisement. It is also about equally about the final which you have in the back end the places system, which you have. Please make sure to get more money out of it. Okay, so so I would generally minimum do like three or four offers in the back and that's is like I'm minimum, you know, I could go up the offers non-stop because I've been promoting so actively in the past three years so I have called a lot of okay, so there is no end to it. But of course you need to decide what's best for your customer before you piss him off your list. So so that's the next part apart from that. What I do is Is I tend to be you know, read a lot study a lot example now the pace Mandela has a CBO cookbook perhaps you could get this for it and read about it because CB o--'s are the new things. Yes, which is happening at Facebook. Then I do be part of elite groups, which is like Tim birds at leaks group with you know, a lot of will Facebook advertisers would hang out and share the case studies, which is not shared out openly to the public. Okay you pay for it, of course, but then you have Edge over everybody else in the market right now have people may not be a part of it and the book may be doing the old simple creative of it and I'm a coming out with altogether new star different. So this is an example of differentiation. So are you you still beat out the competitors, even if they're bigger, right? Then these are the things which I would do a primarily then I see Facebook ads as a long-term thing. I don't think the, you know judging a Facebook ad with its one. I'm weak performance is a fair thing. It's not really a fair at all. I would generally take it like at least like 14 days or like maybe even a month before I try out every symptom angle every time hook which I had every single creative tested every single paste the tested every single headlines flick tested even like I'll just go crazy with every everything I can and you know since cool Africa is a traffic in control. I can test this not like, you know, it's Um traffic it will come today and it's too unpredictable. It will not come tomorrow. It's nothing. So that is the Leverage is for you to optimize the funnel and follow the process for a longer duration of time. So, for example, if I tell you stock mission in the first month or second like for the first three months rather was not profitable, but then it was just like breaking even hardly but then I stuck to the process. I kept this thing kept testing a little bit of more stuff. And then finally we were like two weeks of profitability.	
2	Hmm.	
1	Consider it consider that as a process and keep doing your creators and everything and just like last thing but not the least taste like, you know, we all marketers are actually true scientists. Okay, don't predict things because everything is data what data says is the truth and what people say is all fluff. So please have seat and let the people in the society, you know, go for a walk.	
2	Well, I think I mean when you see that that means it's guys having you can't find information today hiding Facebook ads anywhere. I mean, you know, we talked to God of regarding Facebook ads, I mean, mr. Gordy bharatha, you know, you cannot expect bronze by DX everything everything expect the gourd. That's crazy. I mean and one thing with God of you know, any heightened as is that you should have patience with your advertisements, you know, I saw people who invest dates or pay, you know, they deserve it all together we can oh, yeah.	
1	A business. It's not a sailor. It's already eleven giving the next day.	
2	They say gear you did a business model Facebook ads, you know, you need to have a patient. So it's similar to a business.
