2	Hello, this is Nicole. Hey Nicole, this is Flora from every little thing. Hi Flora. How are you? I'm well, so you called the helpline with a question about a common household item. Do you have a specimen handy? Yes, I do. All right. I got one. All right describe to me what you have in your hand. Okay. I have a cold metal voluptuously curved. Did you think the luxuriously yes. I'm intrigued. I am very perplexed by it. It's this very specific kind of stick that has four little stick sticking off of the top of it. I have never heard the fork described this way except maybe. It's what is it?	
1	It's a dingle humans use these little baby. Okay, straighten their hair out.	
2	I mean I've seen the movie so many times how many times have you seen The Little Mermaid, I would say it's at least over 200 times over 200 times. Oh, yeah. Have you ever used a fork to comb your hair? In recent time no is this why you called about the fork, you know what subconsciously that could absolutely have been a factor that I just cannot get The Little Mermaid and the dinglehopper out of my head. So what do you want to know about the dinglehopper? We use it every day and we never stop to think why were using it and where it comes from and I want to know why. What's your theory about why the fork was invented? I guess when I think of the number one thing I would use a fork instead of a spoon for I think of long noodles. What's the idea that maybe the fork was invented for pasta? Yeah, either like pasta or to go back even farther even eating long slimy bugs like a big plate of earthworms. Yeah. So we found an expert to answer your question about where the fork came from. Hi, Nicole. I love that you asked this question. This is Dara Goldstein. She is a cooking historian cookbook writer and curated a museum exhibit about the history of Cutlery. I love to talk about Forks. Why why because they're fascinating and until I started thinking about them. I had no idea. Here is a surprising thing Forks did not have a seat at the table until the 19th century. The fork really is the parvenu of all of the utensils that we eat with it took many many centuries for it to be accepted while spoons and Chopsticks were going in and out of mouths for thousands of years. The dinglehopper was for quetta non grata at the table. So how did we get to a fork? Friendly World it took centuries Once Upon a Time Forks were not the voluptuous utensil in your silverware drawer. They were more like brawny meets peers. They were used for stabilizing meet after the hunt say you have a big haunch of meat and you want to cut it and you have a hunting knife and you have a big fork with two prongs a carving Fork. Yes. Is a carving Fork so people would they would use the fork to help cut their meat and then they would just use their hands or something else to eat the meat Bingo. They were tools the same way. You wouldn't eat with a pair of tongs or a chainsaw today 2,000 years ago. You would not eat with a fork. So when did this change it's hard to pinpoint the exact first time of fork went into a mouth. But there's evidence of forks being used for dining in the 6th Century in Byzantium that's modern day Turkey, but they were only used in certain situations early Forks were very closely associated with women and with courtesans and with refined Behavior. They were made of iron about 4 inches long with two prongs, and it was meant not Much for eating as for spearing very specific Foods Nicole. Do you want to take a guess which very specific Foods this early Fork was used for I you know, I'm I used to be a waitress at a steak restaurant and we would be instructed to provide a very specific kind of fork with escargot AKA snails, is that the right answer? Snails know what? Oh crap. Well, you're on the right track. The early Forks were designed for a GUI item what we call today's sweetmeats candied fruits and nuts and things like that and in Byzantium, there's quite a bit of evidence that Forks were in pretty widespread use among Elite women who didn't want to dirty their fingers on these. Sticky candied fruits and so they had tiny little forks and they spheroid those suitemates with them Nicole. The first dining Fork was a candy Fork. I'm going to try that next time like Sour Patch Kids, I would eat that with a fork for sure. I feel like there should be a restaurant that does that candy for cue. I like 4q. Mmm for cat about it. That's pretty good. So this was the transformation point where Forks started to be used for eating but then how did the fork go from just being for fancy women and their candied nuts and fruits to being in practically every household in many many countries. We have a fancy woman to thank and her trip to Italy The sort of origin myth of the fork coming to Italy is that in the 11th century the princess of Byzantium married the Doge a of Venice and she brought her glamorous candy fork with her. It probably had some beautiful semi-precious gems on the handles very delicately wrought. How do you think Italians reacted to this Exquisite candy spear? I feel like It would seem more like a hairbrush. It would seem more like a dinglehopper than it would a kitchen utensil. I think they would be confused. They were more than confused. It was seen as the tool of the devil. Yeah. Yeah who's behind this message that the fork is bad the church. It was the Catholic Church. You were consorting with the devil if you were using this Implement which distance you from your food and therefore from god. Wow, that is so beyond dramatic than I would ever have guessed. I know I need to Chill, it's just a for the rationale for why the fork was not to be trusted was threefold first. God made your hands for eating. So what do you think you're too good to use your hands. That was one problem second the fork looked like Devil's horns or a tiny version of Lucifer's Pitchfork. That didn't help matters. And then third there is the xenophobia problem the fork came from the East and people were suspicious nevertheless the fork persisted as the fork developed and got more times. It became a more useful Implement so wasn't just for spearing one kind of food. You could actually do a little bit of scooping with it and scoop. They did by the 1800s before could largely overcome its PR problem in Europe. It was a fashionable luxury item by then but in America, it was a different story. We'll hear about that after the break. By the early 19th century the fork had taken hold in Europe. But in America Fork Fury was still raging John Quincy Adams. He was present from 1825 to 1829 and he brought silver Forks home from France. And this is a quote. It was first whispered by his friends and then shouted by his enemies that he had abandoned the ways of democracy because Forks he brought them to the presidential table and it was as though he was putting on airs the fork was hoity-toity and not for the hoi polloi unlike the humble knife and Spoon which were always on the right side of history and our place settings. It was only in the mid 1800s that the fork was finally accepted in America. Did they just poke through by getting more and more popular? Why did people Start accepting it would really change things was the technique of silver plating was discovered in the 1840s and Sheffield England and in the 1850s The Comstock Lode in the United States was discovered. It was the largest load of silver ever to be discovered at that time and suddenly silver became much more affordable and even very Middle class people started being able to buy sets of silver. Why didn't we just use a cheaper metal? I mean, why did you need silver for silverware to take off? Well, I don't know if you've ever put a rusty iron utensil in your mouth. You got me. I don't think I have well try it. I mean just or just lick it for a second. It has a very strong flavor if you have this beautiful. Piece of food, you do not want to introduce iron to it. Silver doesn't have this problem. It doesn't rust it's not toxic and with silver plating and The Comstock Lode, it's cheaper to make Forks gotcha and this ushers in the Golden Age of silver Ware. So beginning in the 1860s the American silver companies started creating so many different kinds of forks for every different food. Food you could imagine that there is this massive proliferation of forks capitalism. That's how they get you they just make up forks for no reason. Yes, you had strawberry Forks melon Forks lettuce Forks macaroni Forks fish Forks pastry Forks. The fork was actually used until 1922 for ice cream why that is the most spoon food I've ever heard of I mean that one seems to make No sense unless you ate your ice cream quickly those very hard way too quickly before it started to melt these works are really they're really something to behold. I want to send you just a couple pictures so you can see them. Okay, I'm opening the link. We will also put them on Instagram. Oh my God, what is first I didn't know Forks could look angry, but it looks angry which one you looking at the mango Fork. It looks like it's giving us the finger. Doesn't it? It does it's like a mango protector almost not even a mango fork. Okay, I'm clicking on the second one. Wow, it looks like a bird feather and it's almost a spoon that is definitely a spork. That's Macaroni Fork. Oh, I always want so many more problems than just three or four when I'm eating macaroni, but I would not pay four hundred ninety five dollars on eBay for that fork. That's for sure. So this was the state of the fork by the 1900's. It was a fork frenzy dozens of specialized Forks. In fact, this amount of silver used was unsustainable and government got involved it got so out of hand and so much silver was Being used that in 1925 Herbert Hoover, who was then the Secretary of Commerce issued an edict. He made a rule that silver says could only contain 55 pieces Max at the time. Some of the biggest sets had close to a hundred and fifty pieces. It's very interesting that the silver companies had to be told to chill with the forks. And I think since then certainly in more recent times there. Has been a move towards simplification. We don't have to have the same formality. We can grab things with our hands. We can finally Flora we can shovel them into our mouths. Now, you're speaking my language Dara now you can see why I'm obsessed with a fork. So that brings us to the present day, you know, when you look at a fork knife and Spoon, they look like such a perfect family and it looks like they kind of were born together. But no Forks are new to the game. The fork is like a baby the baby in the family that was mistaken for the devil. So the evil baby take on point Forks are evil evil babies. Before we go. I think we came up with a way to honor the forks history. So just close your eyes. Okay, we are preparing a very special meal for you Tyler who's been recording you is getting it ready. Okay. Alright. I'm going to open my eyes. What? nerds Is that am I a fork nerd? Is this a joke? No, you're a fancy lady using the fork as it was originally intended dig in. Okay, it is, you know, it is kind of difficult. I will I will try to do one bite. You know what? That is the fanciest bite of candy I've ever had. I feel like a queen. A little housekeeping a few episodes ago. We Dove deep into the history of goldfish and how they swam into our living rooms. And after that show a couple folks called in with a concern that I'd like to address.	
1	Yeah. I just got through listening to y'all.	
2	Goldfish story and I don't really have a question.	
1	But I guess maybe a concern you over looked very very important part of goldfish and ownership.	
2	You can't keep goldfish in bowls. Listeners you are right say no to the Bowl. That's what we heard from our goldfish expert Dave manly he said fish are healthier when they have room to swim and if you are thinking of becoming a goldfish parent Dave said, this is what you should put on your shower registry.	
1	Well, they will have what they call starter kits which will be an aquarium and get the biggest size aquarium that you can manage in your house or apartment get all the chemicals to remove the Maureen gets a fish food just different kits different ways. You can go and you bring it home you set it up and then in a day or two, you're ready to bring home your first fish so minimum gallons, I would say nothing smaller than 10. I would prefer for goldfish or two because they really are a school fish or social fish. You should start off with two fish 20 gallons would be better than 10 what kind of goldfish should I start with? Well, you can get a common which is a feeder fish. You can get a comet's um EG which has a little bit of a forked elongated tail. If you start out with two fancy your goldfish chances are you don't know enough about fish keeping yet. He's not going to be with you six months from now.	
2	So that's Dave's advice. Don't get too fancy with the breed get the biggest tank you can and you'll be ready for the joyous experience.	
1	And of goldfish parenting, they are remarkable fission if everybody kept a tank with a couple of goldfish and think people would look at goldfish differently. They are very pleasant fish there non-aggressive. They will come to be fed. They will swim in the tank and they will develop with you.	
2	They can grow old with you.	
1	Absolutely. These can be touch there with you 15 20 years.
