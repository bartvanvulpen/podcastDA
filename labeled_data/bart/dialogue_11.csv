3	Hi guys. Okay. So let's talk about under he's and putting your foot down. You don't have to accept anything that you're not okay with you're allowed to say no without feeling guilty for it set your boundaries and stand firm in them. You are teaching others how to treat you you're allowed to tell people to back off. You're allowed to say I'm not okay with this and to stand up for yourself draw a line. And say this is where I stand and if they don't like your boundaries then show them the door and let them know that their lack of respect is showing friends. You need to be picky about who you let into your mental and physical space. Some people will Empower you and others are going to drain you. It's okay to cut those people off in order to protect your energy and your space your allowed to save your time and energy for those who are matching your energy and your effort. You will either match my energy and what I'm putting in for with or you'll get the hell out of my way. I know what I bring to the table and I know my self-worth and my value and I'm going to scream it from the rooftops. I will never shrink myself and lessen my self-worth just because you can't handle me at a hundred percent friends. Stop tolerating less than you deserve stop hanging out with those people that don't want to see you succeed in life. Stop allowing others to break you down. You are enough setting boundaries will probably create tension. Outburst from a few or most likely even a lot of people I'm going to tell you right now friends. Those are not your people stand your ground say this is my line that I have drawn and you will respect me and my decisions or you'll get the hell out of my way. Stay away from people that make you feel guilty for their actions learn to say that's on you. Your behavior is on you the way you move is on you the choices that You make our on you the way you live all on you stop absorbing the negativity and drama of other people recognize what belongs to you and what doesn't then draw that line and separate yourself from those kinds of people who are projecting their Chaos on to you stop carrying the weight of something that is not yours to carry that's on them. Let no one and nothing make you feel like you are not good enough or that you do not belong you deserve to Of a life that you are excited about you are worthy of so much good never allow anyone to convince you of anything less. Love you guys.	-1.0
