We believe in those everyday superheroes during the extraordinary and now goal with this podcast is to ignite in you the flame of Hope and Empowering you with the tools in needing more meaningful and purposeful lives and in today's episode. I'm going to be sharing with you three tips on waking up to a good start. Okay guys, you know, have you been in situations where you would wake up in a haze just as tired as a night before so this is how your routine would go right? The alarm goes off you open your eyes and you're thinking oh my God another morning. I'm not ready to face it. You hit the snooze button pull over your covers and Go back to bed. The alarm goes off the next nine minutes, you get woken up and you're thinking what nine minutes felt like a second. So you get annoyed that time is that he cheating you of time. So you hit the snooze button hoping this time round time will actually understand and won't make it feel so fast. The alarm goes off eight minutes later and this time you reluctantly woke up rolled out of bed like a zombie go to the washroom and with a V heart start your day. So can you imagine starting every morning erratically rushed and feeling anxious? Well, you know, that's not a great way to be starting your mornings and oftentimes a bad start of the morning often leads to a bad day. And that's at least what your mind tells you that you'll be experiencing as you progress throughout the day in reality. That is actually no such thing as a bad. A bad day only exist in our interpretation of reality our perspective of that experience which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So you have the ability to make a bad moment or they exist if you believe it to exist which then leads into my first step on waking up to a good start. So number one the mind what you focus on grows. I'm sure you heard this before so it's all about Programming and reminding the mind on things that Empower and energize you as an individual. So the Mind does this thing right where it has selective Amnesia or oversimplifying things with the wrong symbolic conclusion which in this case concluding you have a bad day because of a less-than-ideal start to the morning. So how do you go about managing that? Okay. So what I want you to try is the night before think of one thing you will be able to do the next. D that excites you so it could be going to the gym meeting a friend for dinner attending that religious talk, you know with your friends reading your favorite book eating your favorite meal the restaurant anything that excites you and make you can't wait to start tomorrow. So when you're on your bed, I want you to close your eyes and visualize that activity you've identified visualize yourself feeling happy energized and confident. To feel like you're already there enjoying it. So in the words of dr. Joe dispenza, so he's an international researcher on neuroscience epigenetics and quantum physics. So he says that the body doesn't know the difference between an experience any thought and you can literally change your biology your neurocircuitry Chemistry hormones and jeans simply by having an inner ear. end now this is something that's mind-blowing because what this means is that when you Embrace an emotion ahead of the actual experience in your environment your actually signaling the gene ahead of your environment and your Gene begins to change your property protein expression, which means you literally become the very person you want to be so this is the power of visualization when you wake up think of that thing you thought of the Night before and let that Empower you and energize you. So it's about setting the tone and mood you want to wake up in you know, conditioning the night and the mind the night before right? So tip number 2 getting your deep REM sleep as you know in a sleep is something that is especially important right for brain health and function you can have your 10 or 15 hours of sleep and yet feel so I thought Jake when you wake up, so it's not the quantity of hours. You slept but it's the quality of sleep you got so these are a couple of practices you could try to promote deep sleep first. It's about simulating in a cave like darkness. And you know, why is Darkness so important to establish deep sleep because at night our bodies produce melatonin, which is something that allows us to fall asleep to stay asleep. So we produce this. Hormone, you know the most between 11 p.m. And 3 a.m. And even the slightest Ray of sunlight or artificial light interrupts the secretion of this hormone. So let's melatonin in the blood. It causes fatigue anxiety hormonal imbalances poor concentration and many other problems so you could try, you know, things like turning off the TV and putting down, you know down your phones well before bedtime so it rule of thumb is Hour before bedtime because you need to mentally prepare your mind to unwind and go into sleep mode. Another tip is to not sleep in the same clothes. You've been wearing all day because our clothes have energy and our body has memory so our bodies remember the energy during the day through the clothes we wore and you want to create a different set of energy for when you go to sleep tip number three waking up earlier. Earlier. So one of the major contributors right to waking up and shares is the fear of being late. So you've got like a gazillion and one things to do places to be people to me and when you hit that snooze button as many times that you're probably done earlier that fear becomes reality and this leads to rushing around in the morning from the moment. You step out of bed and this gives your body a huge shock. It's about Back to sing actually waking up and easing into the day so you don't have to wake up drastically much earlier just try 10 to 15 minutes. We do know for a start for the next one week. So this is a gradual method of getting your body and your mind to get used to the new routine. Once you've gotten the hang of it add another 10 or 15 minutes the following week. So use this time to focus on you know, what your husband wants to eat for breakfast. Not the number of likes. We've gotten our social media not the emails. You have to reply to not the household errands. You have to attend to not your kids not your parents, but just you and I know this can be challenging especially if you've been conditioned to be on the ball and attending to everybody else's needs but your own but I want you to just try just give it a goal. So focus on the activity you identify the night before that makes you energized for Focus on what you want to feel for today be specific on the emotions you want to channel, you know, you could do your morning meditation read your favorite book go for a morning jog, whatever makes you feel good have a set of self affirmations that you repeat yourself. So what I like to do is to look myself in the mirror every morning and to repeat those self and affirmations. So I see something like this. I am beautiful. I am amazing. I am worthy of love. Love and respect and I believe in myself. So repeating these over and over again, they begin to worm their way into your mind slowly changing both your thinking and your reality because the words you say to yourself create the mental story which then creates your very own reality. Sometimes these saying start as wishful thinking right, but they often end up becoming the reality of your life. So don't underestimate the power of what's and you know what that wraps up my three tips for this episode. I hope you enjoyed these tips on waking up to a good start. You don't have a try and change your life so drastically and all at once just pick the ones you're most comfortable with and doing first and stick to it because consistency is key and years leaving you with something to ponder upon you are always one decision away from a totally different life.
