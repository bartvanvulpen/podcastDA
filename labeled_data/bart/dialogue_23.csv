2	In a film crew. There are two kinds of best boy best boy electric and best boy grip. They are assistance to their department heads the gaffer in charge of the electricals and the key grip lighting and rigging respectively. There is no correlation between this and our hosts. This podcast is not spoiler-free you've been warned.	
1	Hello and welcome to best boys the comedy movie review podcast in which we revisit our childhood favorites to see if they still hold up. My name is Rick Deckard. I'm	
2	And I am the Aristotle of pop culture and the Roy Batty of this podcast.	
1	I would say Zach Kevin if you had to be a character from Blade Runner, who would you be?	
2	Oh, I want to present a different question besides Deckard and Roy name any other character named it literally any other character named Blade Runner named?	
1	Okay, is it Franklin? One who leases the robots not into the operation.	
2	Not quite his name. His name was Jay are Sebastian.	
1	Yeah job Sebastian. It was JF Sebastian, but good. Try idiot was a junior scientist JF Sebastian Sebastian.	
2	Okay, the the solid snake of the movie.	
1	I watched the movie with my I am indeed be open so that I could keep track of everybody's names nice because I knew I'd forget. So this week we watched Blade Runner the hit sci-fi classic, which was not a A hit at first and then so cult hit I guess is what they call the last salute Lee.	
2	This is the most cult hit movie. That's ever existed.	
1	Oh, yes it I feel like it tanked like a lot of times before it because like they kept making new versions The theatrical release with the first one that came out was panned beyond belief.	
2	Oh, yeah.	
1	Well, it had to compete with ET. I mean besides that it was bad. It also had to compete with ET.	
2	Yeah, it succeeded in like home video sales and like the Advent of DVD like that's where it like really saw its new.	
1	Yeah, you know what? It also had to compete with the thing which which also didn't do well in theaters because it had just because ET came out.	
2	So anyway, we've had their own Harrison Ford narration going through it ET know all the thing and also ET and also ET this movie released in what my wife used to call me. I don't want that.	
1	This movie was released in 1982 and it stars a bunch of people's actual name right now.	
2	So we have Harrison Ford. Das Deckard, we have the late and great Rutger Hauer who was Roy Batty fantastic best character in the movie. We have an actor named Sean Sean Young who played a Rachel and movie. I have not really seen or heard anything else that she's done and one other big name of the other police guy gasps Edward James Olmos. I remember him best from Battlestar Galactica.	
1	Who was he on Battlestar Galactica?	
2	He was a he was a commander and then Admiral Adama this	
1	Mean anything to me I shouldn't have asked the question about the thing.	
2	I haven't seen if you're not going to bring the Battlestar Galactica game.	
1	Once she even bother us maybe just maybe our fans know or maybe Kevin knows. I don't really know I have I've been chewed out for five minutes. That's totally fair. Yeah, but there was there some other people in this movie weren't there. Sorry. I can not to dwell on this longer than we have to but I swear there were more people who had like you did.	
2	Well, right who I'm Daryl Hannah was one of the replicants press now is it hon are handled?	
1	Daryl Hannah is it Daryl Daryl Hannah or Daryl Hannah? You said it doesn't matter this couldn't matter what you said.	
2	You didn't want to linger on this.	
1	Sorry. Nobody cares. Nobody cares. This will get cut out.	
2	So, um, otherwise this movie sets kind of a major precedence for just sci-fi in general like it wears its Inspirations on its sleeve. You can see a lot of stuff, you know, kind of borrowed from like big works like Metropolis in terms of movie. In terms of just ideas and stuff. This comes a lot from our you are or rossum's Universal robots. The IDS.	
1	I'm glad you mentioned.	
2	Yeah again, if your major here like this is very much the idea of like an urn that place and yet there's always that difference because there is the creation and the Creator we and that's a little bit later but it's something I'm gonna guess is one big theme.	
1	Yeah. We're gonna want to that's a whole theme. Yeah, it's a whole thing. And that's my favorite part of the both the film and the book. I'm a longtime fan of Philip K dick and like that's I guess as long as I'm on it this movie was based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K dick released in 1960 something originally set in 1992 and then later versions put it into a 1921 and then they were going to make the movie take place in 2020 and then they were this is stupid. I don't know why they did this they decided that 20. I reminded them too much of like the standard Vision 20/20 vision say that's fair. And so they changed it to 2019. Yeah, but it's dumb.	
2	It's fair, but it's not a beacon and you're choosing to listen to best boys at the best possible time because we're talking about Blade Runner current month current. Yes.	
1	Yes Blade Runner takes place in November 20 19. So we have does this hold up exception because we're asking if it holds up as a movie, but also does their version of the future hold up.	
2	Up who's to say we are to say we finally get to say this from The Brave Little Toaster review. This is Brave Little Toaster for adults.	
1	I forgot that's a good good call back. Wow, that is true and accurate I didn't yeah. All right. Well, so real quick just for those in our audience who either have seen it but not in a long time or have never seen it. Could we just real quick get like a Briefly like in 45 seconds or less.	
2	Yeah, there we go, like a bomb plot summary and give me why many looking forward to this. No, I before I before the clock starts. Yeah.	
1	Just want to tell everybody so I this is the feeling that I'm feeling now, is that of a test that I did not study for I simply curse rarely looked at the textbook not even open the textbook, but just I feel like I looked at the cover and now I have to take a pop quiz that I knew it was coming. All right and well Do you think you're ready? No, but let's go. All right and the clock starts now? Okay, so we're in the future. It's 80s movie that takes place in 2019 November which is right now, which is Nieto and there's a company that is kind of like a Skynet type of thing where they make robots and then they're like, hey, these robots got to be illegal. So they ship him off to Mars and then they're like I'm if they're still on earth kill him and so they have a Blade Runner and Blade Runner is Han Solo and Han Solo is in not Coruscant, but this Los Angeles and then They're like this cop Basel guy. We just had to took the blade some runs and stuff. Kills itself and they said in the end. Well, I can't believe you got it.	
2	I would miss second that was like if I was to T-shirt be like wow team is but good job for someone who didn't study. Hey, you know what? It was the conviction of your conviction of your summary that I enjoyed the most.	
1	Could I add one thing? Just speaking of Han Solo? Apparently the Millennium Falcon's in this movie. I didn't seem like it's like Easter egg didn't there that was it's free. What what what? Ah no, no will go back. Go back go back. Yes. Yeah, there's like a so they actually reused a lot of things from other things for this movie. I mean not a lot of things but one of those few things was the Millennium Falcon the model of the Millennium Falcon from I think specifically from A New Hope can be seen in one of the scenes. Hold on. I have the Page open with this fact on it. No any mm for many Aerial shot of the city that's not correct. Anyway, all kinds of materials were used to simulate buildings in the city landscape such as miniature spaceships from other science fiction movies and upright model of the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars episode four can be seen with some difficulty to the left of the police building as Deckard and gaffs Spinner is making its descent. That's amazing. Yes. That's very good Melanie and Falcon put it upright and called it a building or part of the building. All right. I think there are some things that that in your review you got worse. Little off. I don't believe they were made illegal and then sent to Mars. They were already legal everywhere and then they started rebelling and were made illegal on Earth.	
2	But so this is how this is where the rossum's universal robots kind of comparison really comes into play. They were made specifically to be stronger and more harder than people with like a quotable intelligence and sent off world to do the jobs. People do not want to do but once exactly they rebelled they hope to the emotional spectrum that was hinted at during the movie. They you know, of course rebelled killed people on their took the system and then they were illegal on on Earth. If yeah, if a replicant came to Earth, they would be retired by the one who runs blades that Blade Runner of Witchblade run away.	
1	Yes. So I was close. Yeah, you know, we're close. Yeah, and it's Zach. Can you really quickly in less than 45 seconds? I'm not putting a timer on this. Can you tell us a little bit more about rossum's Universal robots? Because truth be told I actually didn't see that play when you were in it because I'm a bad friend and I don't know anything about it.	
2	It was a play that was first written and produced back in the 1920s. It is actually the first written ever example of the word robot. That's where it came from the Addition of the term robot has been kind of changed a little bit over time their version of robots were like mechanical. They were still created humans that they were like Fabricators and like designers and such that made them and like in the in the play. They eventually developed their own Consciousness their own kind of society in ways. They rebelled against the humans killed them all and we kind of see that here. We there's no example of them being like mechanical. It's not like the Terminator having a like a realistic-looking flesh covering over a metal endoskeleton.	
1	They are essentially people that were designed and built and give any four year life span to yes compensate for the fact that they were essentially stronger than people and that's actually I think an extremely important distinction for this the purposes of this movie is that they weren't met they're not like a Androids and other other media where it's like even the the ones that look human on the outside, but they're all robots. It's on the inside. Like I assume data isn't start or like my previous example the Terminator like the Terminator. Yeah, this these robots in Blade Runner were made of largely organic Parts, which is why you have la like scientists a little guy's eyes. Yeah. Yeah, so they are and that's why they that's why they have the kind of like, what's the truth test in real life called?	
2	I'm glad you asked that's the voight-kampff test and that's what it is.	
1	That's what it is in the movie. What's it called in real life The Voice?	
2	There's a real life.	
1	If one test I don't think that's a real test.	
2	I mean it's it's like maybe the Turing test or something like that that no, that's the test.	
1	So the Turing test is how is used to distinguish the difference between artificial intelligence and real intelligence. The voight-kampff test was invented for this story. What's the real lie detector test called that like, I mean like the recap te like, oh, yeah cat caption a captcha that smell like if you were arrested and then taken The police and put down in a chair and then they measure your heart rate and ask you a question or is this like the is this like the what's up - Hector test. I'm arrested by the police and they don't put up six pictures and I have to point out which of those pictures has a stop light in it. So a polygraph test can eat both of you. Sorry. I have to blow whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, hold on polygraph. Holly. Dry detector test. Yes detector test. I asked you for a lie detector test. Okay, you said and you said hold on and then he said I think about test. Yes. I said a lot of things are you want to come on? No, I'm gonna suck. Hold on act. I'm gonna cut in right here the part where I said lie detector test so that when you listen back to this later, you're going to feel like a bunch of fools polygraphed. You mean a lie detector test. What's the truth test in real life called? What's the real lie detector test called that like a cop would use know like if you were arrested and then taken to the police and put down in a chair and then they measure your heart rate and ask you questions. What's that called? What's a lie detector test called? Test both of you. Sorry, I have to bleep that I'm sorry. Okay. All right, the thing about the voight-kampff test and a major theme of this film that they don't ever outright say but it comes up in the book is every question or most questions. Yeah, every question had to do with animals and empathy to animals and that's how in the book they differentiate between humans and replicants in the books. They're called and he's Androids is it's a test of empathy. Which they say in the movie designed to evoke an emotional reaction and they use animals in every single question. And so going back to the question about you find the nude or whatever. It's on a Bearskin rug would you allow this? I would not that my answer was I will not allow the Bearskin rug because oh robot. All right. No. No, this is see garbage. See this is hate this stupid quiz and this is stressing me. Yes it is.	
2	Cheating the admin for smart.	
1	Yeah, right. Well, hold on. Here's the thing though is the book features. Something called Mercer is MM which is a religion that was founded in and so the the the setting is like a post-apocalyptic World. There was a World War Terminus. And so this is post that there's a new religion founded called Mercer ISM that highlights the importance of empathy towards animals and it's like it's seen as messed up. I can't think of a fancy word for that. It's like, uh Nets it's frowned upon to not have a pet of some sort. If you can't afford a real pet because most of them are extinct you get an robotic pet and so in the book Rick Deckard has this Electric Sheep that he owns in the movie when he's talking to the to the dancer robot who has the boa which actress was that that was a Surah.	
2	So that was Joanna Cassidy.	
1	So fun fact that boa snake in that scene was her real pet. That's funny. Yeah. That's just why she was like totally cool. Just like having it on her neck. He asks his that real and he says if I she's like if I could afford Realty think I'll be working here. It's because a lot of Life on our planet has gone extinct and that's why the there are the robots which like in our world electronics are very expensive in this world.	
2	They're cheaper than having a real authentic organic patent and a lot of indications throughout the movie if you could tell something was replicate or not a lot of creatures or people had like an orange tint to their eyes.	
1	So interesting. Yeah.	
2	That's correct in all but one instance of it, which it's the one the big one.	
1	Oh Deckard. Yeah. Okay. Let's get into that real quick. And I want to and I actually want to get Kevin's take first because so like our next segment is like first time you watched it and what your reactions were. This was Kevin's first time seeing this movie, correct? Yes. Yes, very my first time one of the like big discussions people have about this movie including the creators of this movie is is Deckard himself a replicant. And that's been debated like the the director has one take the writers have another the book has its own. I believe in there since Ford himself has his own take the Z interesting Kevin. What do you think? No way? No, he's a human.	
2	Thank you. Absolutely. He is human 100% is not a replicant Ridley. Scott is wrong.	
1	Here's here's where I'm at with it. I don't have so like canonically, he's human. Yes, right. He's we like in Cannon. He's human but that's boring white board is what is what is canon? Cannon being lightning-like is can in the book is Canon the script of the film. What is Canada? I would say I would say the book and then like the original takes of the of the movie as well as like the author's intent both the screenwriter. I think I think the screenwriter intense for him to be human.	
2	Yeah, like literally in my experience. The only person that wants this is Ridley Scott. He thinks it's this it's this great like whoa, what if it is like no that's really stupid. Actually.	
1	It's not stupid I disagree and I will fight you but we can fight later.	
2	I do not understand this it limits the movie if anything, I don't think so.	
1	How does it limit the movie?	
2	It's not the question of is a or is so-and-so human that's not as interesting as what does it mean to be human while there what is in this is the measure Humanity.	
1	I think in this case those two questions are married because we have to say whether or not okay. Well hold on first I want to say also when I say, it's Cannon it's because they made a sequel. Well in which Deckard is still alive, which means he lived longer than four years. So he's basically a human right? So but I want to have this discussion as if the sequel didn't exist because the sequel's not based on any of it gets I'm sure it's great but better than the original movie, that's a hot take right there. I can't speak on that but I wish I could because I want to disagree but I don't know if I would disagree because I haven't seen it. So I think that the discussion of is decorative replicant and what does it mean to be human are one in the same. Cuz because the fact is and not like but like just because the whole debate is like or at least for me.	
2	I don't want I want I want you to answer kind of practical effects on that. What what about Decker do you think makes him a replicant?	
1	So it's so that's the thing is I don't I wouldn't take a specific stance that he is or isn't if we're talking about specifically the version that we watch the Final Cut in right?	
2	I mean I Final Cut they didn't really change a lot about that like Anything the Final Cut Is Ridley Scott being like I'm sticking to my guns on this right? Well, it's when you finally got creative Direction back and he got to make the movie he wanted to make but it's also like if deckard's a replicant, he's a really he's a really replicant how he's weaker than basically every other model. He's while they're hot. They're not all strong though horrible at his job might I add I wanna let's take it back to the spot where I want to touch on the one.	
1	You said first they're not all extremely strong. They are extremely strong not all of them pretty well not all of them though, Chris.	
2	Well who was weaker? Tell me Chris.	
1	She how how is she had him in a headlock and couldn't crush him with her own thighs or twist his neck. She was made because she's a pleasure model. She's not a lifting. She wasn't a lifter or like a fighter. They all have different purpose.	
2	He's still capable of it though.	
1	And like what's the best capable and she's way if she was way stronger. She should have been able to just snap his right, but he was it should have been over instantly. Okay then.	
2	What role would decorative been if he was a replicant?	
1	So to convince him that he's a human so that they can have somebody to fight the replicants because he was supposedly one of the best blade runner's but if he's going I'm sure if that's true, but let's just let's just turn suspension of disbelief. The movie says you're one of the best so we'll just pretend it's true for a second.	
2	Hello in the book. No, hold on a second.	
1	What if what if running blades is hard?	
2	He doesn't really have any preparations for like, oh, hey I'm being Killed by robots you'd think he has like a contingency plan for like, oh this robot Ambush me or like oh, hey, I'm going to interrogate this person. I believe is a replicant. Let me put on a fake voice. Let me like like I can't let them know who I am. It's like they already don't know who you are. Like, what's this? What's this?	
1	Well got money after you're deferring to the reporter seen hold on you're referring directly. You were referring specifically to the scene in which he pretends to be a reporter. Are you? How are you?	
2	I'm here.	
1	Funny the whole my God like the voice Harrison. Yeah, but um seen master of Comedy, but but hold on listen, he does for that specific scene have to play a character like the fact because he can't just be like hi. It is not it is high backstage. I just need to like I'm beyond that. Hold on. We're beyond that. It doesn't the voice. Maybe is Goofy. But also it kind of sells the part where like reporters at least for that The Stereotype of reporters are these like also he's not a result order way. It is he's not It's so suspicious the everything he's doing it's like why doesn't he just like doing more natural what you're so the question you're saying the question should be why didn't he do a better disguise, but that doesn't matter because the first question you posed was that everybody didn't already know. He was the thing is he's backstage at a performance venue and the only way to justify it is for him to be like Oh, I'm here to talk to you because that's the performer he's talking to and anyway.	
2	Anyway, I can seen major more sense than you're giving a there are so many elements in this movie. That do not work. If Deckard is a human nose. No, hang on hang on there that some animals don't like if he's replicant because literally every rule that's established about a replicant would be broken instantly with him and canonical e its La changed a little bit with Rachel because she was created like last longer. I may be in the original version she was but like, where would he get his memories from he can't have the same memories as tyrells Lance's that's easy.	
1	That's not a real question. They could be implanted just like nobody again like that doesn't work.	
2	For him it's why not? Why not? I don't even get why I have to explain this then the movie itself is like what if he is is like but then why is he a Blade Runner? Why does he have this position? Why do the police hold him into such a high regard?	
1	I can answer all of them for you because the real Deckard was the best at his job quote unquote God, but for some reason let's just pretend maybe he's not there and they need somebody to track down replicants who's really good at it. And so they build the replicant Deckard implanting with deckard's memories and then convince	
2	He's the real one. What is terrible then? What is title not recognizing what if he's just pretending to not recognize him then he would then Harrison Ford is in the greatest actor in the universe, which it doesn't seem quite like in this movie. He's a good actor. He's good in this even but he's supposed to have this kind of like jaded view on the world. He supposed to act like a robot because in the end he regains his Humanity. He is human from start to finish but humans in this world are cold and calculated. The machines are the ones that gave Gain, these unfettered emotions. They have to deal with like I have so little time to live. I don't know what to do these emotions. Literally Roy Batty fights off the creeping eventuality of death and becoming like an animalistic monster almost but in the end, it's like I would rather you live with the fear that I have had that life is fleeting short instead. You just you just kill us. That's it like Okay, but what does that have to do with whether or not that because if he was a replicant that has nothing what the hell does the movie even mean? It means nothing.	
1	It means that like, okay.	
2	Is he thinking? Oh, yeah, he just acts like a robot because he is a robot. What about the other humans are they all had they all robots literally if the moment you open that Pandora's Box is Deckard a replicant. Then you have to ask maybe gafsa replicant maybe tyrells a replicant maybe literally every right here is exactly that but that tells him I work because no but it's the idea of it expands the question of what does it mean to be greater concept here not is they human is they human matters? What does it mean? It's the idea of the overarching what it means to be human.	
1	And apparently if everybody is a robot then Humanity doesn't mean anything that's but yeah, but so that's the whole point of this thought experiment is that we get to that that's a great conclusion. You've just drawn if everybody is a robot Humanity. It mean anything if anything, the replicants are the humans eat exactly. What it by your logic. But I think that's a great. What's the whole point of the movie? It's a great conclusion to get to for this question. So like the thing I love about this movie and this is the same thing. I love about philosophy and by this movie, I mean this specific edit of this movie because this is the one where Ridley Scott had the chance to put in one thing that that then allows him to pose. His question of is Deckard a replicant. It's you see Deckard have a dream about a unicorn that he doesn't shit. It's stupid, but he doesn't share that with anybody. He's right.	
2	He didn't see me. Another and at the end of the movie Matt Ridley Scott did hold on it was from a different movie.	
1	He just like so like he borrowed that scene.	
2	Yeah. It's like it was unused in that movie is like, let's just put it in here the Unicorn means that he's a virgin right?	
1	But here's the thing is it's for me. It's not about the it's not about a yes or no. It's about the question and that's what philosophy is. It's what what does it mean if the answer is yes, it's not is the answer. Yes. It's what does it mean if and so for you to say it it defeats the purpose. Is that the movie if the answer is yes, he's a replicant. I don't think it does. I just think it gives you the option to explore that mentally and you followed the process exactly where I would have which is if he's a replicant who else is a replicant and then what does it even mean and like at that point it's like what's the difference? What's the difference between human and robot and then Zack I want to ask you this question is when you say he acts like a robot.	
2	What do you mean? He's literally just like cold and jaded if the movies anything to go by about his nature as a Blade Runner he's done this so long. Long as he says in his own horrible narration, I left because I had a belly full of killing which is so stupid, but that's do but that is stupid.	
1	But can I put then can I ask you do humans? Not ever feel cold or jaded? Have you never felt?	
2	Okay. Well first off, that's silly to ask because like yeah, it's like, oh he's just this like, you know, sad former shell of a man's like aren't we all but it's like know again like that's not aren't we all that's here is capable of being that way. Where Ridley Scott's coming from he thinks it's this masterpiece if like he's this person but it doesn't work. It's and I got the philosophy behind it. But the logic behind it movies have to be drawn with a sort of logic movies have rules philosophy can make those rules interesting they can make us think in new ways. It's a good representation of that. But at the same time if you have a character that breaks the established rules then the rules Stuck. How does this break the established rules?	
1	I don't think it does. This doesn't break.	
2	It really does we found who is not a good Blade Runner? We see a man who is who like may I remind you about the me to movement and him and Rachel? That was weird.	
1	Yeah. We are gonna talk about that later. That's the worst scene in the math. That scene is testing. Okay, so so because he does I'm very confused. Hold on hold on time. I taught him. So first off I just I dispute the whole idea that he's bad at all. A drowning like I genuinely do dispute that because while he was bested by what's it Chi what's the one at the end Roy? Yeah. Okay. So while he is bested by Roy at the end at the end of the day like those were the four most dangerous replicants that the LAPD had ever dealt with they didn't really specify that they said it was just for replicants like they're the newest.	
2	No, they didn't say no.	
1	No, they have that whole scene. They that whole scene where they're debriefing where they think they're very decorative. And they're like we need you you're the best and we need you which implies that nobody else could have done it and at the end of the movie he speed and yeah, and he even he even mentions that like, hey, we tried to get the guy who replaced you to do this and the guy who replaced you is like currently in the hospital room just said like this, you know pick Harrison Ford he's better at this. No, he know they have something where he was apparently idea machine the movie.	
2	It's really easy to kill them Rachel duck kills Leon.	
1	Okay? No, but it's not it's clearly not that easy because other like there are other like blade runner's that can't do it and she also only kills Leon because he was distracted and she shot him in the head.	
2	Well, yeah not it's legitimately Zhang. He had that kind of skill right find a way to get him in a bunch of you saw him off and like didn't get killed and and Leon is specifically a stronger model.	
1	He's a he's a laborer model, right and so for him to fight that off shows that he's good at what he does. Yeah, that's it's amazing that he survives that interaction at all.	
2	He was if he was actually good at his job. He would understand that. Oh, hey, these are people that might try to fight for their lives, huh? Maybe I should like just kill them ahead of time and then much much like the point of it. I can just flash my badge and say I so but it's not but he didn't see him but like but he didn't someone that's like, oh there she is. Hey, I have a gun. Let's okay. Hey, hey everybody. All right. I'll get you that. I'm a I'm a Blade Runner. Look my badge says, I'm a Blade Runner. That wasn't human. That's he's fine and people just walk on that's it's that easy.	
1	Hold on. I will give you that with his Aura now.	
2	I am wondering why he wouldn't well cause like when he meets Zora does he know she's the leaders out from his because she's very Advanced TV computer that lets him Zoom magnify enhance and turn a picture.	
1	If only we if he figures out that she was in the room with the one person that does have no cat textual is zoom and enhance on a photo it wouldn't that be so hold on, but we don't know for a fact that he knows. She's a replicant.	
2	Well he It's either like again with the debriefing. He saw me. He he saw what except he thinks she is.	
1	Yeah, I think it's he thinks she is so he designed you investing and that's why he tries to act like he's just waiting for the opportunity. No, I think he's waiting for she doesn't write he's looking for evidence. And then when she tries to kill him, he's like, oh, this is a blade that I need to go run right like that terminology.	
2	I'll admit that. I I don't know why they're called blade runner's I'm you know, what? No. No, sorry. I know either call blade runner's because Ridley Scott thinks that's cool.	
1	And so wait one of the things I want to say and then I'm going to realize back in and we'll do our podcast. I don't it's not that I like this movie because I think he's a replicant or that he's not I like the ambiguity. I like to I like to think about the ambiguity. I like to the movies and that's just you two being down people like yeah ambiguity of of this kind of thing is interesting.	
2	But if if there's like a specific like kind of like, That's the reason why I like Inception so much because at the very end of the film you do not know if it's a dream or not. But in this there's so many hints and pieces that Ridley just is like Ah hell yeah. I'm pumped about dropping this what people are gonna be so psyched.	
1	It's like yeah, but like that that could be true and when we talk about Ridley Scott later, maybe always but as all just being somebody cannot wait and to talk about but just as somebody who has read the book and because they took up they do this in the book to at some point in the book. One of the characters is like and they say this line in the movie, but they go further into it in the book. They're like have you ever done this test and Deckard is like I don't matter if he says yes or no, but I know at some point in the book, he does take the test and it shows that he's not a robot but then but I think one of the other questions that I like is like is this test even valid like these all the questions are about animals isn't that and we did the test ourselves and it is the one half of one and one half of you two are replicants. Well, we already knew at least one of us was replicants. Yeah. Sorry Kevin. It's	
2	And it's Zack.	
1	Um, I do hold on I do think they'll like any argument of is Harrison Ford's character Deckard Rick Decker is Deckard is the in the like is did Ridley Scott make Deckert a replicant the thing Mickey brought up about the unicorn in the memory the Unicorn the memory is very it's very like Inception a yeah. Well, yes and I think that's right because he doesn't tell anybody that dream but then Gaff leads him this origami, you know. A corn and how could he possibly be leaving him little origami like things throughout the movie and so it just kind of like it implies that Gaff knows something. We don't I'd but I think I do want to say I think this is what's interesting about this movie is that I think different people who watch this movie are watching different movies, which could honestly be true.	
2	In this case. This is one of the few movies were you really could be like what version of the movie did you see? It's like it's this.	
1	Oh, I don't mean it's literally you talking about that's not what I mean like the three of us. Watch the exact same movie and I think have different takes on it. Oh, yeah, like wildly, but let's let's do our podcast. I want to talk about the very first time you watch this movie Zach.	
2	Tom God. I can't remember the first first time I remember I thought it was super boring when I first watched it.	
1	Like II that's how I remember here's here's my question for both of you guys. Yeah. How old were you guys when you are on this for the first time? I think like rough like Bob. Yeah, 15 or 16. I was a sophomore or Junior. I want to say around a guy same point.	
2	I think like I I was definitely at least in high school when I first saw it got it.	
1	Okay. Got it. Got it. Got so that's the level of Youth we're dealing with here. But then I think I swear I thought Zach you watched it. You had did you not watch it for a long time again after that because I remember I remember being in a Facebook chat with you for an early viewing you had where you were like, I'm gonna sit this was definitely in my yeah.	
2	That was a few years ago where it's like, okay I have Like enough I have enough brain power in my mind to like comprehend ideas and like have my own opinions instead of being like a kid and like flashy lights. That's fun. And this was very much like like parts of it are like boring. It's like II agree with Kevin if you're not prepared for it. It's really tough to get through. Like if you do not know what you're getting into. If you did not know from the outset that this was like a slow burn thinking man, sci-fi the	
1	Then we write none of those things. I knew. Yeah, sorry. Oh any of that. I cleaned my room on a Sunday and then started watching. That's when I first saw this and it's so what did you think of it? Kevin after watching it because now we can Branch into our how did you like it now Kevin? How did you like it for your first and most recent time my first and so far only time I didn't like it interesting. So here's here's here's I again context is probably important so I usually watch His movies the Sunday before like we record these usually like around a Sunday and I typically like watch the movie and then about 20 minutes later get on here to record this podcast. And so that's what I did for this movie and I shouldn't have done that because it so like I was kind of tired so like I definitely like started napping through the first half of the movie it was so boring. Oh my God. Why is everything with music under it I get it. This is I'm Atticus outright need to relax soundtrack by evangelist. Um, I actually liked the soundtrack but it was too much way too much like that.	
2	It's it's very it's very cool. It's cool. And so many parts of this movie are plucked from like other different things. I've branched out.	
1	Yeah. Yeah. It's very cool. Visually. I was struck frankly by Much Star Wars episode one just stole Coruscant from this. First time I watched this was I think 15 or 16. I watched it at a party. Sometimes that's yeah parties a strong word. That's what you called it when like for 15 year olds. Watch a movie in a basement. Yeah. Well, they were like 10. Oh wow. Yeah. Wait, I feel like I had seen it before that but that's the most that's the earliest memory. I am watching it. And then I read I've read a lot of Philip K dick stuff. I don't know. So yeah, I saw I just I became a huge fan of Philip K dick in high school. And so I've seen this movie like a handful of times over the years. Like I'll go back and re-watch it. I watched it the last time I watched it was besides yesterday a year ago on the plane back from Ireland who Mmm Yeah, and I liked it. I just like it I could see this being a good plane movie if you know what's going you like if you're good, if you're ready. Yeah because you don't your dragons case.	
2	It's better than like taking like Nike will put on blade runner fastest.	
1	Bleep wait Zack. Did you give your modern reaction to it?	
2	Um, I know a lot of people have probably said or saying what I'm saying every time I kind of go back and watch Blade Runner, I this one in particular, it's like man, I remember a lot more about this movie than I thought. I did like I was just thinking of lines and then they'd say it it's like it's like I wrote this thing. Wow, but uh, I still think this is one of the best-looking movies ever made like Ridley Scott if anything know, Knows how to make a movie look good. It is beautiful and this is the best. It's the best argument for practical effects and films it is. Oh, yeah, they only used 90 individual shots of special effects such a rare aircraft nowadays, but it's so important so necessary.	
1	Although I will say they re used the same camera shot twice. Oh, yeah. That's it. There's a shot. It's but like the same like it has the same Zoom to it. It's the scene where like the spaceship in one of them is like landing and another one is just flying through that like area of Yes, there's a shot of the Coca-Cola billboard. Yeah use it twice. It's the exact same thing and I even like pause the movie and I went back. I was like, hold on. This is the same as the thing. I saw 20 minutes ago. Okay. I'm glad I'm not the only one who caught that one.	
2	That was yeah, there's little things but yeah, but every time I go back and I watched this movie, I forget how good if a character Roy Batty is for everything bad. I have to say about Deckard Roy Batty more than makes up for it. He is the he's like the Deep moral core of this. Movie and he gets the best lines. He's Rutger Hauer is so good. And I'm so sad he passed away this year.	
1	I know it's really rough because he was amazing. So and he he was so good. Like he was cast without doing an audition Ridley Scott just cast he saw him and whatever other movie he had just done and was like, I want him and then Rutger Hauer like knowing that obviously because he was offered the role and he accepted he decided to mess with Ridley Scott by showing up for their like very first meeting he was wearing Like hot pink track pants good and like a sweater with a fox on it. Yes, and something else kind of crazy.	
2	That's good stuff. I can tell you about a little other little bits of details out of the kind of accumulated from this movie as well.	
1	It's just like I don't actually he's just like phenomenal. Yeah. I think my recent reaction. I like it every time I watch it. Like I always love to just sit there in the think about the the philosophy of it and I think the place I'm coming from is like I guess like my Ritual and philosophical background is like I'm just very much an atheist. And so for me, I think the conversation of what does it mean to be human doesn't include the existence of a soul and so for me I said, there are a lot thinking about like is artificial intelligence really even even knowing like that's a robot and that's a human if the artificial intelligence is that advanced does it really matter? Like what does it mean to be a valid like, yeah like this movie proves whole heart right?	
2	Like I have that kind of scene view, but it there is God analog in this movie that of Tyrell himself again looks like Egyptian god, he has this like mine said and kind of like view of it and everything and then his bedroom was specifically modeled after the Pope's bedroom. Yeah, like like clearly there's some like Inspirations taken from that and then Roy meeting his creation, which we don't have the luxury of doing it doesn't not just meeting but it means that we are like we would love to have questions ask our creator. But in the yay we all we have Her answers for what we have created.	
1	Can I ask you guys a question? Sure. How would you improve this movie? Oh, yeah, I want Kevin to start because I know Zack has a lot.	
2	I know right away how I would improve this movie.	
1	Yeah. So Kevin, I want to hear from you first. Okay, so that First Act is a lot. I think we gotta gotta gotta got to shorten it a little bit. For example, the fact that we have the same cut twice I would like like, well me and Nikki we're talking about where you could see the Mmm Yeah, like we don't That like there's just so much of the movie that is beautiful, but we don't need to see so we can cut some of that and hopefully get the runtime down to an hour 30. All right? No, I think that's fair. Yeah Zach. I do want to hear from you.	
2	Now. I am very interested in the opening crawl where we figure out where Roy Batty and the other applicants came from when he poses the question or the phrase. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes. I wish we could actually see us. Is the audience see that I want to see a Roy Batty movie. I want him to be the main character.	
1	I want Interstate like you don't think him is the main character would be too much.	
2	No, I wanted like you don't think like I agree.	
1	He's the best part. I think he's the best part but do you think they'd ruin it? Do you think he's like, I feel like he shines like I thought I do want to say before I say anything. This is Zach's time to decide how he would improve the movie then so I want to honor this good point. Let me have that you have made a good point, but I want to post it.	
2	Mission of do you think maybe one of the reasons he shines as a character is that he is secondary secondary and although he does kind of feel tertiary putting secondary characters can sometimes be like the best ones people love the veil and that's an example and we with some things like Maleficent. We kind of got that sort of answer of like, let's have a movie about the villain and they weren't always good so it could be a bit of a toss-up. But if anything I would still love to see Seymour from his perspective anything This is kind of a be a tough get let's turn this into like a twelve part series and some of the flashbacks of is what we see on the colony worlds with them being slaves to mankind. They Revolt they Rebel Deckard maybe like, you know Smiles a little bit so Netflix, so Netflix original series Netflix where you have for time series Blade Runner.	
1	Okay, you have more time to explore the other characters. And Harrison Ford doesn't phone in his entire performance which with the opening monologue.	
2	He literally did he he purposely made it so bad Ridley Scott wouldn't use it and he was just as surprised as the rest of us when the theatrical release came around God.	
1	He did a bunch of stuff like that like the haircut. He hasn't that movie. Oh so bad. He specifically got it. So he wouldn't have to wear a hat which I don't know how that tracks like. I don't understand that thought process, but he got a haircut so he wouldn't have to wear a hat and he got this haircut that like Ridley Scott.	
2	Didn't care for it but no longer had a choice on dealing with and and to enticed her Scott's credit have it's tough having your complete Vision intact, but with this quote that I want to read very soon. It's very much on the Lucas side of things George Lucas side of things where maybe it's best.	
1	He didn't get his entire Vision but the Final Cut I think might feel like the Final Cut is his final Vision. You only hold stop stop stop. I don't understand this discussion. We've been Dancing around it. I'm new to this. I think a lot of our listeners might be new to this. What the hell cuts. Are you talking about Blake exact you go Blade Runner is Infamous for having several different specific cuts from this movie.	
2	There are certain cuts that only exists behind very specific closed doors or other events, but the two main cuts that were talking about and the two most important ones are the original theatrical release where there were so many bad decisions. Has put in place it that's the reason why this movie did not succeed in theaters. It is the reason why it is a home video darling and then you have the final cut because you know, Blu-ray movies got to come out sometime. This was released in 2007 at the Advent of Blu-ray. And this is the version that most closely matches. Mr. Ridley Scott's sir Ridley. So that's why do we have to so like what happened?	
1	So, why was there	
2	The movies movie studios happened my boy.	
1	It's so I know in production. Sorry. Can I say the one thing about this so I can sound smart? Yeah audio recorded So Ridley Scott, they had finished shooting the film and then they can Ridley Scott. They didn't want him there anymore. They brought in two of The Producers to take over for him, which is why we ended up with these like narrations that Harrison Ford did in the original version which	
2	Were bad right Zack they were intentionally bad so they would not be put in.	
1	Yes Harrison Ford like read them terribly. Well, they were already bad. But then Harrison Ford would have read them terribly so they couldn't be used as much as possible. But anyway, they had these two producers come on and try to like quote-unquote fix what Ridley Scott was doing, even though what they ended up doing was making it worse.	
2	So we ended up with a bad theatrical release and then a bloated unnecessary addition to help the audience understand things where it's Amber. Woody is the best part about it, right?	
1	So then like so so hot time out. So yeah, I'm going to interrupt you guys to ask questions because I yeah do it it's genuinely don't get what's happening here. So so there's this original theatrical cut, right and it's terrible and yes, everybody hates it pretty so is that still available? Like did you guys want have you guys seen that recently? Like have you just read about it?	
2	Oh, yeah. I've seen bits of it. I know enough about it to where I'm glad that's the version I did. And watch if you're looking to just watch this casually watch the final cut. It's the best.	
1	I've never seen. I've never encountered the theatrical version. Although I too have seen bits from it like on YouTube you can find like clips of it, but I don't know where you could find the theatrical version.	
2	Yeah, that one might legitimately tougher to find the biggest takeaway from this is that Studio Movie Studios think the general audience is stupid. Yes, and it's 10 to some degree. The world has proven that Lee look how many Transformers movies there are by Michael Bay and other good movies like Annihilation that was released last year bomb commercially because people don't want to sit and watch like a slow-burning sci-fi movie. They want explosions.	
1	They want they want Chinese pandering they want commercialization out the ass, but you know what it was both Chinese pandering and like I feel like every Asian person in this film existed more as a prop than a cat. Character yeah, and it was usually test before that was a huge issue.	
2	I didn't yeah, hold on.	
1	That's another thing. I didn't understand so like it's supposed to be set in Los Angeles, right?	
2	Yeah, but they're speaking like shy they're speaking a street language. That's a combination of English Spanish Japanese what anything else you can throw in there the okay.	
1	So and is that like the is that like the the world's nod to globalization? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe that's interesting.	
2	I didn't know that sack and technically that's not how language works. But it's interesting.	
1	Well, yeah, that's an interesting ticket get jumbled up over the course over the like long stretches of you.	
2	But like mystery, there's still that there's still this kind of like barrier between culture and language so we can experience a culture but if that door is called its racism.	
1	What do you mean? I think that even in today's society we still have segregation. I don't just think it exists. Oh no question you look at any City the Your hoods I mean Philadelphia is a good example Boston's a good example like the neighborhood. I'm in has a huge Muslim population. Well, you just don't get that in other neighborhoods and it's not a legally enforced segregation, but it's just this like thing that happened and so the reason we don't have this like this like amalgam language I think is because people I think largely based on the way, like white people dominate the public space and then make it like not comfortable for other people to be in but if you could remove those barriers remove the issue of why S as a power structure and then you allow other cultures to actually mingle and then America became a real Melting Pot that's why I find the language believable from the framework that the movie placed it in I was going to say from the 80s framework, but the 80s were wildly racist and Ronald Reagan is and Ridley Scott.	
2	Also not the not the most saint-like director out there. Oh really? He is said some pretty bad things among the thing that I am going to say when his movie in 2014 Exodus came out which was Was you know very much Egypt and stuff. He was he had very clear explanations for why he had a white wash his movie, you know, very very clear very concise reasons why he had to have whitewashes movie. I can't mount a film of this budget where I have to rely on tax rebates and Spain and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such Scott says that I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up. Yeah, just like that sounds like he said,	
1	It's too hard to have a person of color on our movie.	
2	I'm gonna backtrack us a little bit not to like reinforce the argument, but just to kind of get mr. Scott's perspective. This is a question interview. We had at what point while making the original film did you decide that decoratively a replicant and this comes from the from the Creator's mouth himself? Okay. What I'm about to say is unfiltered I'm saying exactly what he said. Hang on. I'm sorry. I have to get ready for this.	
1	Yeah.	
2	Yeah get in character at one point while making the original film. Did you decide that? Third would be a replicant. So it was always my thesis Theory it was one or two people who were relevant were I can't remember if Hampton agreed with me or not. But I remember someone had said well, isn't it corny? I said listen, I'll be the best judge of that. I'm the director. Okay. So in that you learn, you know by then, I'm 30. I'm 44. I'm no I'm no chicken. I'm very experienced director from commercials and the Duelists and alien, so I'm able to you know, answer that with confidence. Since at the time and say, you know back off. It's what it's gonna be Harrison. He was he was never I don't remember actually, I think Harrison was going I don't know about that I said, but you have to be because Gaff who leaves a trail of origami everywhere will leave you a little piece of origami at the end of the movie to say, I've been here I left her alive and I can't resist letting you know, what's in your most private thoughts is when you get drunk is a unicorn right? So I love Beavis and Butthead. So what should follow set is that duh? So now it will be revealed in the sequel one way or another.	
1	What wait what he loved that song and that's all quote unquote. That's exactly what he said.	
2	Yeah, he loves beavers and Butthead. Oh man.	
1	I Now understand why Zach takes such an opposite stance because Rob he's got some crazy because the coz coz R it went now I get it now that Ridley. Has said in his own words, he's obviously a replicant. I too kind of want to be like your drawing and terrible. I guess I get it we've um, we've definitely lost track of this podcast because I didn't ever tell you how I would improve this movie. No, you didn't ya I didn't can I yeah, please. Yeah. I like a lot of this movie. There are two big things. I think I change one is there's a lot of lore to this movie that they leave out. That you just have to like put together you are either left to put together like the fact that like a lot of animals have gone extinct. You can kind of pick up on that if you really try but it's never outright sad if you know your stuff like that so they could spend more time giving you the lure right talk about that. There was this world war and this is posted. This isn't just future Earth. This is post-apocalyptic Earth.	
2	I I would agree on a very show don't tell basis.	
1	Yes. Exactly. I don't necessarily need it to be like said in a Look we but I would like rum or Harrison Ford rajbhog. Yeah, the other thing is the romance between and romance is a strong will strong word have the romance between Deckard and Rachel is bad and there's no way around that. It sure is that it's extremely problematic another fun to the point where like I would give it content warnings for like abuse and sexual assault like it's just terrible fun fact. Yeah. Yeah, that is very it's very abusive and bad. Yeah, it's just horrible. And and none of the characters were comfortable filming it Zach.	
2	What's your fun fact and is it person Ford and Rachel's actor Sean Young hated each other on set. They did not get along at all.	
1	I what I was reading earlier was that at least for this specific scene Harrison Ford was really uncomfortable filming it because they do not like each other. I didn't know that. Okay. So there's this moment where he like pushes her away and there's this look of like hurt on her face and that was real because Apparently in the scene like in the filming of it. He pushed her too hard and she was genuinely like offended but I didn't know they didn't like each other. That's interesting. Yeah. I mean I kind of like hell to make this seems awful like yeah, I'm rough. I don't I hate this I've decided I hate this I hate this. Well Kevin, I hate it. I hate it. I hate Kevin. Yes if you hate this movie so much. How would you make it worse? Oh, I wouldn't change a thing. Um, I didn't know the actual way actual way. I would make this movie worse is I would just have the entire movie be the First Act. So like they just said, okay. No continue. It's just set up. It's all set up. All they do is have Harrison Ford's character like Mumble around and fumble around and like try to eat pho soup and they he wants to Noodles and there's he wants for noodles in the guy only give them to its that it's just that and what do you mean I can only have two noodles Joey tell him out, right?	
2	I want more noodles. So this is a slice of Life film.	
1	Yep. It's a slice-of-life film and dystopian. Cousin Kevin.	
2	We actually any worse.	
1	All right, that's very good Zach. How would you make this movie worse?	
2	I think I would create Ridley Scott's truest interpretation of this the idea of this overly bloated man whose ego is right up his own ass Beavis and Butthead Square in the middle of it all.	
1	Can you please explain what you mean when you see you? It's a Beavis and Butt-head. He had a lot. Maybe it isn't but head okay, he's okay. So just like so my guess is that my guess is that it would be Blade Runner with like Beavis and Butt-head styled comedy.	
2	It would be an episode of Beavis and Butt-head.	
1	This is a 30-minute episode of Beavis. And Butt-head were Beavis is Deckard and Butt-head is Roy Batty and it's just like haha.	
2	Oh, yeah that voice is definitely you're just making noises. I guess that's that's Beavis and Butthead. Ridley Scott loves it. It's his favorite show.	
1	He told Marley stop clapping lack. The Clapping is not good audio.	
2	Sorry. It's okay loves it. And I want to give Ridley Scott exactly what he wants his own Star Wars prequel movie.	
1	I think that's a fascinating take because the movie was bad until he was given back full control. I'm like every version of it was bad until they said okay fine do your version and he may not remember, this is a 1982 Ridley Scott.	
2	This is 2000 mid this okay.	
1	Just bouncing unhand modern Ridley Scott modern Ridley.	
2	Scott gets his hands back jumbles it up.	
1	Like it's that's important. So he gets to in the vein of George Lucas. He gets to like 1990s the what 1997 was to Star Wars he gets to do some scaccia. Okay, I get it Mickey. How would you ruin this movie? That's a tough one. Honestly it is now. Okay, I want you to picture this.	
2	Okay, November 20 19.	
1	No, you know what December 2019. I do have to picture that right picture that future Los Angeles. The snow is falling. It's a romantic comedy Han Solo is Rick Deckard.	
2	Solo is Rick to sorry.	
1	Did I say I'm so yeah, you did say I thought that was no part of your time. He's gonna be my Han Solo of true Han Solo Rick Deckard chewy plays Gaff, which is Edward James Olmos character. It is a romantic comedy that follows a rick Deckard trying to woo the the Beautiful replicant object of his love interest. I don't know how to I don't know how to pitch a romantic comedy. Apparently Rachel object of yeah, that's the word. Yeah of my eye, I guess the point is that I would make it a romantic comedy set around Christmas time. What's that one? Very famous Christmas romantic comedy Love Actually This is Love Actually, it's called. Oh I was going to call it. Can I can I can I can I pitch it to you? Blade Runner and Blade Runner actually is good. Mine's less of a pain. I was just thinking like synthetic emotion actually wait wait, I'm sorry to clap again.	
2	I got it. I got it. Okay Do Androids fall in love during Christmas do you Androids?	
1	Or iPhone does just that was so bad.	
2	That was this is not anyway.	
1	I'm gonna dismiss myself in the pot. That's a good. Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is I just think romantic comedy focusing on the romance between decorative Rachel at Christmas time, but it's the same. It's the same horrible post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, like it's very brutalist architecture mixed with like future scientific, you know, it's a call on concrete but all in these angles and stuff very neon and it makes you feel weirdly sad it's still like there's like a heavy dense dust cloud everywhere the building still plume like fire into the sky, but it's snowing and Santa's coming. Santa's going to come and give you presents. I don't like the way I said that can I please please please I'm literally begging you Zach. We didn't do it yet. And I'm surprised we didn't uh-huh.	
2	Do you have any reviews of this movie that you want to share with us? Um, let me see. They've been pretty strange there either like Bob Thomas from the Associated Press saying Ridley Scott has produced a new vision that is foreboding or they could be Like Gary Arnold from The Washington Post who says the contradictions that plagued the movie are Apparent from the outset.	
1	Are there any like user reviews anywhere though?	
2	There are there are so Anton we have from Priscilla. She found it to be so underwhelmed. I've heard about this movie for years. I finally took the time to watch it and boy was I disappointed I can look past the old FX. It's the story. That's so weak after watching after watching. I've read a lot of people. People's pontificating about it. Was he a replicant was he not none of that matters. The point is that the story is very very weak worse than most movies. There is no on-screen development of the two main characters. Love Arc. Are they in love question mark at some point why who knows it is jumps from random scene to scene by the hype if you want, but some many things today this being one of them reminds me of The Emperor's New Clothes. AIDS everyone talks about how amazing it is without seeming to realize there really isn't anything there.	
1	Okay. So you lost me for a lot of that but her comparing it to The Emperor's New Clothes is fascinating in a very Scylla and maybe the critic of our time. Yeah, so that's confusing and scary to me.	
2	Do you have any others I found Roger deibert.	
1	I think he hold on hold on a second. I have a lot to say about okay first off.	
2	It sounds like you agree with Professor stuff.	
1	I don't I don't agree with Priscilla, but I'll just like to hang out with people that don't like this movie.	
2	So I mean I would just want to hang out.	
1	Like I just I don't know you seem like you're a fun hang. Um, also I like that the way that she would improve the movie is the exact same way that make you would make it awful you would have low incomes would have ruined the movie was made it 11. Was when it made the romantic comedy and I think she would have interested. I think you're right. Okay. Yeah, what did what did what did Roger Egbert say? Oh, it's Roger eager. Oh, sorry what it Roger Ebert Ebert yogurt. Say what are you? Okay. Wait, hold on Raj. Robert Rogers, all right. So what did Egbert Dogman gobert say? Sorry, I can't I can't stop wait Bertram Bertram Bert. Hold on Bertram Bertram Igor Igor.	
2	What did he say Kroger Rogue irregular words had said in an early review that it looks fabulous. It uses special effects to create a new world of its own but it is thin and it's human story Zack. Yes Zach.	
1	Yeah, are there any Our because what we've from for I just want to know what the every man thinks and all I've heard so far as Priscilla. Do you have any other Everyman reviews?	
2	We need the Everyman review? Let me see. Oh, I couldn't find a plugged in review, but I found Common Sense Media, which does the same thing. So it parents what you need to know is that Blade Runner a Vengeance a bleak 2019 Los Angeles that's dark oppressive polluted steeped in fear and features genetically engineered organic robots called replicants that look just like humans. Is it any good? Well, it's based on the short story by you know, Philip K dick the Androids dreaming and all that. This is a very this is a deeply physiological yet violent picture. They're gonna hang on that. Since it's not too violent, oh, there's constant tension, sad music bloody officials and menacing side effects that add to the dystopian mood. Sorry, sad music got families considering viewing. This film should avoid the first released version like the plague instead go with Ridley Scott's original Vision in 20 in 2007. They released the 25th anniversary digitally released. Okay, the final cat. That's what they mean.	
1	And you should put on hold on. I need you. I need to pause this. Okay, is this is does this website review films and then tell parents whether or not they should allow their children to watch the Absolutely, this movie had a lot of violence. I always kind of I was going to claim the like the full frontal nudity at one moment not full-frontal the there is booby nudity. But I'm I feel like that also contradicts my own personal belief of like the like supporting the free the nipple and like like why is the one breast obscene in the other isn't right? Right, but it's me that then this like Christian website and all we do.	
2	You wouldn't find talk about that right?	
1	It's weird that they wouldn't be like parents. Don't let their kids watch this movie. There's a booby and also like Prince's death is wild.	
2	It's pretty she likes.	
1	Yeah, it's disgusting. I don't even mention that here's here's where I'm at. We've said a lot. This is the longest we've ever recorded for sure for sure right where I think we're done right?	
2	It's this is the longest we've ever recorded.	
1	For that clipped worse than I've ever heard anything in my life. Good good good. I want to make your ears suffer your voice distorted so much. I need to bring us back together because we've been recorded. I just have to pee so bad is all I want to say is that we've been recording for a really long time and I've had two beers and I really have to pee. Okay, Zach. Yeah, can we spin that wheel of reviews?	
2	We are spending that we live reviews. So it's tough to get the definitive answer to what is and what it isn't human. But when it comes to reviews there's no denying that every single one is arbitrary. So in the end we get to decide our own reviews and will base it off of that. However, sometimes we get very interesting results here on The reviews sometimes we have to go beyond the Mortal coil to figure out whether a movie was good or not. So I have gone online to an online Ouija board. Wait, so did you let okay and I asked guest was Blade Runner a good film.	
1	Do you want to know what the oh my God, that's oh wait, wait. Wait. Are you saying that we love you know, that's not the wheel of did the we love you. Say review it with a Ouija board. Yeah. Okay, you gotta tell us that you all you said was you went to achieve dude.	
2	You can't just go right to the we'd sometimes also I hold on time out time out.	
1	I need to make a stipulation. I do not endorse anything with the okay nor do I do nor do I endorse any of the results or findings of that's fine. I can I make a similar stipulation sure. I also do not endorse any results or findings of the Ouija board. They're wildly fake. They were invented by a toy company.	
2	However, however be well actually that's not true.	
1	They were invented by 2. They were invented by to scammers in the 20s and then a toy company took over.	
2	I feel like it's appropriate that I did an online one because we're not dealing with regular ghosts. We're dealing with technology ghosts.	
1	Oh God.	
2	When this podcast has been fine.	
1	That shut up. I can't wait. I don't need your like pocket anymore.	
2	When five-hour window. Just give me the Ouija board. When posed the question was Blade Runner a good film the Ouija board told me leave me now so that so even though we g board was like go away which we do for takes Kevin's it's it is not interested. So I'm truly cursed good. Me and the demons want this to be over you can put that on the back of your box Ridley Scott.	
1	I'm working on it. Hold your mouth slightly over the pointer and follow it as your answer is revealed.	
2	Okay, I'd like to also ask the technical I got it I did.	
1	Now you're ready. Yeah, how would you rate Blade Runner? Okay. Yes, it's what I got.	
2	It's just went up to yes. Hey, all right your spirit liked it.	
1	Now. Here's my question Zack.	
2	What website did you do this on the first one that Google show me that me too, but I'm just curious if we got the same one probably.

1	How do I have to okay just do it. No. Oh just said no. What? What did you ask? No. It's keep the keeps moving. Not not okay.	
2	Oh my God. I hate this what city tell you ever not. Okay and not KN. Okay. It's getting this. This would be this would be better for a Halloween review.	
1	I think when we did Ghostbusters we should have asked the spirits like well, this is hard because it's but I did ask it. Hold on. I asked a very important question. I'm sending actually a screenshot to you because I	
2	I just assumed you wouldn't believe me. Okay, so I did a skit is Zachary replicant do the spirits Beyond think they understand what they're talking are.	
1	They Ridley Scott in me thank is a straw as a weak word. They know that Zack is indeed a replicant.
