3	This episode of the ortho bullets podcast will go over the topic of bisphosphonates from the basic science section on Ortho bullets.com. Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs that prevent bone mass loss by inhibiting Osteo class resorption. They prevent formation of osteoclast ruffled border microtubules causing apoptosis inhibition of Osteo class also interferes with normal bone healing and remodeling there are two types of bisphosphonates non nitrogen-containing and nitrogen containing base. Phosphonates nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates include drugs like to live your innate clojure Nate and it originated nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates include drugs, like alendronate reset. Your innate pamidronate ends. Alendronate zoledronic acid is relatively new and appealing to patients due to IV administration every 12 months indications for bisphosphonate use include osteoporosis metastatic bone disease multiple. Myeloma Paget's disease Polly a static fibers. Pleasure total joint arthroplasty to prevent osteolysis early-stage avascular necrosis osteogenesis imperfecta and metastatic. Hypercalcemia contraindications include severe renal disease as the primary mode of excretion for bisphosphonates has renal other contraindications for bisphosphonates is following lumbar Fusion as there have been decreased spinal fusion rates and lab animal models. There's actually increased Fusion Mass size, but these drugs decrease the actual Fusion. Eight as far as the general mechanism of this phosphonates, they accumulate in high concentration and Bone due to binding Affinity to calcium bisphosphonates are ingested by Osteo class and work by two different methods depending on the presence of a nitrogen atom on the alkyl Chain the mechanism of non nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates or that they form a toxic ATP analog which accumulates in high concentrations in bone due to binding Affinity to hydroxyapatite calcium and then ingested by Osteo class. Which then inhibits Osteo class function and induces apoptosis, the mechanism of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates is inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which is a component of the intracellular mevlana a pathway. This is the same pathway responsible for cholesterol production acted on by statins nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Also inhibit gtpase formation use of bisphosphonates as treatment for vertebral compression fractures and osteoporotic patients is indicated. For a bone mineral density of 2.5 or more standard deviations below that of a young healthy adult that is a t-score of less than 2.5 standard deviations. As far as out comes with one year of treatment with a pharmacologic anti Osteo product medication the risk of vertebral fracture decreases by 50 to 60 percent use of bisphosphonates for non vertebral fragility fractures is indicated in fragility fractures in osteoporotic patients, and they tend to be effective in reducing the risk of multiple. fractures, for example alendronate reduces the rate of hip spine and wrist fractures by 50% ra said Renee traduce has vertebral and non vertebral fractures by 40% each over three years and IV zoledronic acid reduces the rate of spine fractures by 70% and hip fractures by 40% over three years in osteogenesis, imperfecta patients cyclical IV pamidronate Administration reduces, bone pain and Fracture incidents and increases the level of ambulation and

3	And as far as outcomes, this is still considered investigational.	
1	However, randomized clinical trials showed that bisphosphonate treatment was more effective at preventing head collapse than Placebo at two years bisphosphonate collapse was found to be 6.9% His Placebo collapse and 76% finally as far as side effects and complications of bisphosphonates adverse effects of these drugs may include esophagitis dysphasia gastric ulcers osteonecrosis of the jaw a typical sub trochanteric and ephemeral stress fractures and or radiographic changes consistent with osteopetrosis. That's all for this review about bisphosphonates. Hopefully that was helpful. Look out for questions related to this topic on this weekend's question session. And hopefully this episode will have prepared you for that review.
