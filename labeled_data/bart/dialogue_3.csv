Hey, how you doing? Oh, you didn't kill yourself Yay. Good job. Good job. Everybody. Welcome to Welcome to the voices in our heads. Oh, man. I'm	
3	During this episode of the at the last possible second because I've been really scared to do it. But I've been working hard on it and this is a this is a you know, I originally put the category of this podcast is comedy and I'm going to try to make this one funny but you know, I am a stand-up comedian because I was basically basically a clown when I was a kid and I was trying to make my mother who was bipolar happy. So that's why I do what I do, and I'm really used to putting Her into the dark shit in life.	
2	So I'm going to attempt to do that in this episode, but we'll see. I've been crying a lot this week and it's because of these fucking emails that you guys have been sending me is not. I mean, I'm glad I asked for it, but I wow. You guys have been through a lot and I knew you know because I call those guys we fucked and that podcast has opened up this whole new world of the terrible shit that people go through when their kids that they never told anybody which is crazy.	
1	It's not crazy.	
2	It makes a lot of sense because sometimes you don't even know when shits crazy shit could be crazy. And if you grew up we shipping crazy all the time. You're like, this is just my shit.	
3	I wouldn't say it's It's just the shit. I live in so I'm going to be we're going to talk about childhood trauma and buckle up baby.	
2	I guess you probably might need a trigger warning for some of the shit. I don't know.	
3	I don't know when I read some of the examples that people have sentence. I me detailing the experiences. They've been through that's that that's going to be a whoo that ain't cute.	
2	That ain't cute.	
3	But if there's one thing is why I wanted to do an episode on this childhood traumas something that I've read so much about and I'm on the on the verge of being seen being sick of it, which is a good thing because you can't just think about the shit all the time. You got to have fun and enjoy your life. You gotta go outside take a walk like today self-care motherfuckers self-care today. I was like, I haven't been out of my apartment all day. It's 4 p.m. Uh-oh. So I went and got a Starbucks and then I sat by the river. I sat on a bench and I took slo-mo videos of pigeons and seagulls and I ran into them so that I could get a cool slow-mo video and then I felt bad and you know, that's one of my side effects of childhood trauma when I speak up about my feelings. I feel terrible about it. And then that makes me mad when I get angry and everyone's like yeah, okay, and I'm like, I don't know am I	
2	what is so what is childhood trauma great question the definition of childhood trauma and this is according to the National Institute of Mental Health has United States organization PS.	
3	I just want to say the beginning everything I'm talking about here. All the references the videos the websites the books the songs all the shit. They're they're listed in the resource section of Christina agents in.com. It's Christina spot like real fucked up, but whatever okay care why is tyn a so The stuff you don't have to write it down because it will all be on the website. You have to be like tweeting me like when here is it? It's on the website.	
2	But but where it's on the website but website.	
3	Okay, the definition of childhood trauma, this is according to the National Institute of Mental Health childhood trauma is defined as the experience of an event by a child that is emotionally painful or distressful which often results in lasting mental and physical effects. So what the fuck does it do to you?	
2	What does childhood trauma due to you?	
3	So these I got this off of a website again, it's going to be in the resource section on the website that I title this in my notes according to the so according to the National child traumatic. Stress Network this basically summarize what my therapist who specializes in she does cognitive therapy, which is really fucking great. If you're experiencing side effects of that.	
2	I'm about to go over she specializes in trauma and all the things that I'm about to reach from you from this website for National child traumatic stress Network. What a fun that work. That is I don't want to go to that holiday party ever was gonna be crying. This is basically what she tells me almost every session.	
3	Ian when I'm with her because I'll come in I'll be like, I don't know how I feel.	
2	That's my when one of the things I deal with I don't know how I don't know how I feel and she'll be constantly reminding me that when you're a child and you experience big emotions your neurological shit in your body is not built to experience an extreme emotion like oh Mommy hates me or why is Dad punched me in the face that didn't happen to me, but it did happen a lot of you guys.	
3	And the parent is your main source of food of shelter of clothes parents are supposed to do things as another thing. My therapist reminds me of that. I realized like I don't know if I had this I did have it because there is video proof of it. But when my mom was in her deep deep deep depression this type of interaction was not available to me. I didn't realize it at the time because I was you know 3, but a child or parent is supposed to take joy and Delight. In their child experiencing Joy that's like a thing that's supposed to happen and that definitely happened to me but it didn't happen all the time and I got taken away and it definitely didn't happen to a lot of you guys my God, we get to this email section pulled put on a seat belt.	
2	Okay.	
3	Anyway, so here's information from this website. I'm just going to read it directly because They say it smart people words and I want you to get the best information again the link on the website when a child grows up afraid or under constant or extreme stress the immune system and body's stress response systems may not develop normally later on when the child or adult is exposed to even ordinary levels of stress these symptoms May automatically respond as if the individual is under extreme stress, for example, an individual may experience significant physiological reactivity such as rapid breathing or heart pounding or me. Shut down entirely when presented with stressful situations these responses while adaptive when faced with a significant threat when you were a fucking kid are out of proportion in the context of normal stress and are often perceived by others is overreacting or unresponsive or detached and boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.	
1	Oh boy.	
2	I don't want accent that is but I cannot tell you how many times in my life and I don't think I'm look I can get hormonal and p.m.	
3	SE and I know usually when they that's the case, but I also know when that's not the case. So just a heads up to all the men out. There was some anybody doesn't menstruate don't fucking tell a woman how she fucking feeling that it's related to PMS.	
2	He fucking knows her body and even if it is and she's like nah, just give her second. Okay, but I would react so extremely to situations like the the with men like all a lot of my trauma bullshit place out in romantic relationships because I have this idea that and I think it's	
3	When I was a kid, I had to do a little dance to get my mom's love because she would kind of look at me with a dead face and for a parent to look at a child with and they look dead in the eyes even though we're fucking babies.	
2	We pick up on that shit. We're like well, well Allah and she's supposed to be playing with me. You're not playing with me. Why you look sad is it my fault? Is it me?	
3	And so what will happen is it's like this Automatic Survival mechanism that children are born with which is fucking crazy children are so	
2	Resilient so resilient I venture to say more resilient than adults because it's we adults we fucked up and we got all these things in our head that we think are true and there's just not but when you're a kid, all you got is survival mode muthafucka.	
3	So for me for example is what my therapist constantly reminds me of is you weren't getting the responses you need from out of your mother. She would look at you with dead eyes. I plug and played her this video of me when I was 11. I believe I mentioned it on this podcast or one of them or I don't know when I'm talking. I don't even know what it's for. But whereas in front of a Christmas tree and I was 11 and I was really hyperactive and my mom had the camera and she was talking to me and telling me to do things kind of ordering me around and I was like I show this to my last therapist, but then she retired and I'll think no Warren. I miss you and she kind of cried when I showed it to her and I don't get why so can I show this to you? And can you tell me what you think? I don't know. I had that like weird gut thought of like show this bitch this video bitch in a very respectful way. My therapist is great. And I showed it to her and she was like, oh my God, I'm like what?	
2	What the fuck? Do you see? What do you see that? I'm not seeing. Oh and I started crying.	
3	I always cry in therapy.	
2	Whoo Let It Out Boy girl, whatever. Let it out. I cry. I'll get into the I'll sit down on the therapist couch and I'm like hi just because it's a sensitive environment where I know I'm going to share and go into the dark corners of my mind that I don't really necessarily want to go to but I do so anyway,	
3	there's gonna be a lot of tangents like this.	
2	I forget where I was at.	
3	Oh, so I would I would I would automatically do if my mom wasn't giving me the attention I needed or kind of was looking at me like she was dead and and there was evidence of this exact thing in this video that I showed her because she's like your mom sounds like she's dead because she was very heavily medicated on medications that did not do her justice and I cannot say this enough the doctors did not listen to her. I feel so bad for my mom because she wants to get better. And she wants to do the work. But when I was a kid, she was so hopped up on medicine that made her do crazy shit and when she would go to her doctors and be like, yo, I don't want to drive my car into a ditch with my kid in it. They're like but like give it like a week like you just have to like give it a second.	
2	She's like really I don't want to throw shit at my kids. That's like not something I want to do. I'll actually really love my kids and I would be behaving like them.	
3	Hey Nancy come the fuck that like she that's that's the treatment she got from these fucking doctors. This was a Virginia. She has good ones now. So a result of this, where was I so many tangents? When the parent is dead in the face and they react to you weird in a way, that's they have a substance abuse problem or are mentally ill the child will automatically think it's their fault because if it's their fault that's good news because you could do something about it and you don't you're not even consciously thinking any other shit. So I'll go into my therapist office and be like, why am I such a people pleaser?	
2	Why do I bend over backwards for everybody? Not just God everybody not all the time, but I'm too giving of myself because I was taught that	
3	I give all of myself and take both of my antennas and have them pointed at mommy or at whoever the fuck at 31. Whoever all my life.	
2	Then I'll receive the love that I want.	
3	All girl that I had at Works learn that the tart the hard way, okay continuing for example, okay stress in an environment and this causes overreacting I found an overreactor shit.	
2	I don't do it anymore as much but man.	
3	Oh man, I would feel like I was an octopus and the Incredible Hulk was grabbing each one of my tentacles like a different Incredible Hulk was in grab was grabbing one tentacle and and pulling it in one way and then another Incredible Hulk was grabbing other one. The heart of pulling it like the exact opposite way like all my tentacles were being grabbed.	
2	That's how it that's and so it when I was in those states of I guess hyperarousal you fucking come up to me you text me and I'm like shut the fuck up go away. Like I just couldn't take it and I'm like, why am I being a bitch and then my friends and like my boyfriend be like yo why you being a bitch? They didn't say bitch because they're nice people, but that's what I was being I was being and when you act when you react to things extremely and your logical current self is like, Yo, why the fuck am I react? I don't wanna be reacting this way, but there's like a you're like Sigourney Weaver and you got an alien in your belly except in your brain and your heart and you're like what the fuck this alien is taken over the system and I don't want it to be doing that that fucks up your self-esteem.	
3	Anyway, let's continue to read more smart people words. Stress in an environment can impair the development of the brain and nervous system and absence of mental stimulation in neglectful environments May limit the brain from developing to its full potential children with complex trauma histories, May develop chronic or recurrent physical complaints such as headaches or stomachaches who stomachaches there's one interview that I'll play that I'll be the it'll be an episode of this podcast in the future. It's me my best friend Melissa, and she we were just talking about stories and she's like you were Always really worried that your mom was mad at you and you your stomach always hurt and I was like fuck that. Yeah, you're right adults with history of trauma in childhood have been shown to have more chronic physical conditions and problems.	
2	They may engage in Risky Behavior or does he girl that compound these conditions?	
3	For example smoking check substance use chichchu, yak and diet now do that. Well, I eat kid food at night.	
2	So maybe that's the thing and exercise habits that lead to a be City.	
3	Exercise habits can lead to obesity. I'll get that one. But whatever complexly traumatized youth frequently suffer from body dysregulation because you nervous system all fucked up because you were because you've got dealt something that you weren't designed to handle yet.	
2	Your neurological system was not designed to handle in your a little kid, dude, you're a kid meaning they over respond or under respond as sensory stimuli.	
3	For example love me some examples.	
2	They may be high percentage sensitive to sound smells touch or lights.	
3	Or they may suffer from conditions in which they are unaware of pain. I tried to cut myself once when I was 11 because I was like, my mom went away. It was in a mental hospital for a while. I don't remember I can't I thought that was when I was younger, but I know when I was 11, my mom like 10 11, my mom wasn't really I don't know where she was but my hair is really curly and my dad like would attempt to brush it.	
2	I'm like no no. No, I got it. I got it.	
3	I got it. I got it and I didn't get it. Like I couldn't brush my own hair because it was so thick and curly and nodded and so I just wouldn't brush it. So I would just put it up in a clip and I would tell my dad I brushed it and then what would happen is the Harewood Matt. It would fucking Matt. Like I was a dog in an Alleyway like one of those like the dog from Ariel Little Mermaid, you know, Eric's dog Eric so hot by the right wasn't he hot. Well Eric's dog, whatever the fuck that dog's name was like Kind of dog, but who's found in an alley way. He was neglecting their hair is matted. Like that's what my hair started to be and I all my God, I would cry I'll get made fun of in school, but I was like guys, I don't know how to brush my hair.	
2	But I was too afraid to ask because I Neva Kno like your parents are supposed to help you brush your hair, but I also knew enough to tell my dad that I got it and I didn't because I was I was taught or I was under the impression that I had to figure everything out for myself, and I'd be the parents my own parent.	
3	So anyway, this really got me upset the hair thing and I tried and I was like, I'm sad I'm gonna cut myself with a razor and I took a razor for my like a like a bit like a guy's razor like a Gillette, you know couple plates once he shave your legs with and I like press it up against my wrist and I was like Wow and then I threw it against the wall and migrate not doing that, but I know self-harm is a big thing for some people. The big thing for some people I tried it. I was like, nope. My tolerance for pain is zero as a result.	
2	They may injure themselves without feeling pain.	
3	I felt that pain but you know suffer from physical problems without being aware of them. Yo ass fucked up or the converse they may complain of chronic pain in various areas for which no physical pain can be found.	
2	Oh and that fun. Oh, that's a joy. Children who have okay, here's some emotional bullshit. Tell me this resonates with Yael children who have experienced complex trauma have difficulty identifying expressing and managing emotions. Oh is this my bio and may have limited language for feeling States again. Can't tell you how many times I've a try to communicate to a man that I love how I feel and I opened my mouth but nothing comes out.	
3	There should be a lot of Little Mermaid references in this episode.	
2	I did not intend for that.	
3	They are just popping up but you know when her celestial Girls fucking voice that was like me every time someone like Cena.	
2	How do you feel or why you so mad. Where is this anger coming from like fucking know and then that then you don't have the words for it and you get pissed at yourself.	
3	Because when you think you have to run your own life as a child, you become a perfectionist and let me tell you something. I used to brag about being a perfectionist that ain't nothing to brag about because being perfect is impossible. So you're already setting an unrealistic expectation for herself.	
2	Meanwhile mind you everybody listening to this. I realized this like a week ago. So I'm new to this whole thinking and understanding about perfectionism. But I would get really upset with myself when I couldn't communicate and I'm like what the fuck is my problem?	
3	Childhood trauma they often feel they meaning kids with trauma internalized and or externalize stress reactions and as a result may experience significant depression anxiety and anger.	
2	Mmm so many anchor tax I've had and I was like, well never do it in public because I'm so embarrassed about how I behaved then the now I did it.	
3	I remember I was outside the Empire State Building one's going to therapy and I accidentally erased a video of me the goddamn Comedy Jam.	
2	It's going fast over the summer and I wanted to see it and I was so mad at myself that I like.	
3	Screened in the middle of Fizz in 34th and everyone's like oh someone going to shoot us and they're like, oh, it's a girl She's Mine. Their emotional responses may be unpredictable or explosive a child May react to a reminder of traumatic event with trembling anger sadness or avoidance. Check check check it E-Check motherfuckin check for a child with a complex trauma history reminders of various traumatic events may be everywhere in the environment like the sky. That sucks. So I made it up such a child May react May often react powerfully and have difficulty coming down when upset.	
2	That's he'd girl.	
3	And a lot of you since the traumas are often and interpersonal nature even mildly stressful interactions with others may serve as trauma reminders and Trigger intense emotional responses. So when you're triggered a psychological trigger is you're reacting to what just happened that is a low-level offense as if it was the thing that caused you all this bucking fucked up fuck shit in the first place Having learned that the world is a dangerous place where even loved ones can't be trusted to protect. Yoo-hoo that hurts children are often Vigilant and guarded in their interactions with others and are more likely to perceive situations or sometimes. I just burst out crying whenever you finish it and I just got to take a second.	
2	And are more likely to perceive situations or stress as stressful or dangerous while this defensive posture is protective when an individual is under attack.	
3	It becomes problematic in situations that do not warn such intense reactions. Oh if I had a nickel alternatively many children also learn to tune out emotional numbing to threats in their environment making them vulnerable to victimization. Difficulty me. Don't worry. There's some good news at the end of this guy's I promise you it's not I'm not doing fuccboi theater this episode obviously because I don't feel like it right now, but there's like good news at the end. So just hang in there baby difficulty managing emotions and pervasive is pervasive pervasive. Yeah, I'd rather pervasive. Yeah. I read it right and occurs in the absence of relationships as well having never learned how to calm themselves down. Once they are upset many of these children become easily overwhelmed. Whoa, for example in school they may become Traded that they give up on even small tasks that presents a challenge. Oh my god, dude. I was making the survey for this exact episode that's going to be in the link on my website.	
2	Where is it your website.	
3	I created this survey because I've always wanted to fund a survey on trauma ever since I read all these rape emails from guys we fucked and I'm like, you know what?	
2	I don't have I don't know how to do that, but I can make a Google doc with a quiz and I did and it's in the description this podcast as well as the website.	
3	But when I went to do it, I'm like there's so many intricate like I had to think about so many things and I had a really put a lot of thought into it and this just this episode of general that I procrastinated guys.	
2	I'm this.	
3	I mean, this is Tuesday night that I'm doing this and my poor Mike Mike Oscar rally. He added to this fucking good. I'm sorry man. I was procrastinate because I don't want to face these things.	
2	And it just I was like, this is too difficult. I want to do it.	
3	And when you're a perfectionist procrastination is something that happens a lot because you're like I'm not going to do it until it's going to be perfect.	
2	We all can't be Liza Minnelli.	
3	I don't know why I use that example, but I did children who have experienced early and intense traumatic events also have an increased likelihood of being fearful all the time.	
2	And in many situations, it's funny to me.	
3	They are more likely to experience depression as well. Okay, so he get this kids guys and gals. There's this Ted Talk that a couple of you message me about and I was like, oh don't you think? I don't know about that Ted talk again the link to this in the thing my website whatever this is this Ted Talk blew my mind because one of the things that had was echoed in a lot of these emails and it's kind of my like Journey with the trauma shit is I didn't realize I was traumatized until I was in college and the shit happened way earlier.	
2	Because like I said earlier when it's when he shits crazy do use just shit.	
3	And so when someone was like I had this intake appointment the first time I did therapy after when I was in college, it was after a suicide attempt on my mom's part when I was on the phone with her it was the night that was the night before I moved away to college to when that happened again. She was on medication and it's really hard for me to say what happened without saying that because I'm very defensive and protective over her because sometimes it feels like she's my kid in a weird way. If that makes sense, but I finally that was like the last thing that happened dramatically in my life. I would say and I Was Eighteen Seventeen or eighteen when that happened so I'm still kid. My nervous system is still I'm a teenager but still developing and so I sought therapy more like three years later and I was broke bitch Baroque ass bitch and I was like, where's like therapy for board? People and then I found a place it was in Lincoln Center not in Lincoln Center. It was in Lincoln Square.	
2	They took you on stage and you're like now is your time to shine and we're all traumatized were very good at being artfully creative.	
3	It was in Lincoln Square and they did an intake appointment with me and then they pair me up with The Specialist or the therapist and then the first session I had with a therapist after this intake appointment. I was like bawling blah blah blah and she and the group of this young woman goes. That's why you're in the trauma unit.	
2	And I was like wait, we wait ma trauma. It's so it takes I was 22 when I first understood that this was traumatic and you might be 99 right now listening to this.	
3	First of all of your ninety nine year old listening to podcasts. I want to be your grandkid because that's pretty cool.	
2	But if you're 99 and you're like, oh shit, oh word shit that shit.	
3	I went through. During the Dust Bowl that was dramatic.	
2	My mom was an alcoholic.	
3	I don't know how long ago the Dust Bowl was I'm a comedian. We think I read actually I've been reading a lot lately because I don't crush on anybody. Anyway, Nadine Burke Harris. What a badass motherfucker. So I watch this Ted talk when I started I found I don't how I found it. But I this is what around the time where I was like, oh that she was traumatic. Okay. She does a TED talk. I just called her childhood trauma affects health. Cross the lifetime this chick Nadine Burke Harris. Her name deserves to be said all over town. She's the best. I love this woman. She's so comforting her Ted Talk is so good. I loved I loved the way she did it.	
2	I love the way she talks. I love her.	
3	I don't know. She just feels comforting a motherly when she gives them but these are some quotes from her Ted Talk some of these are exact quotes and some of these are me summarizing and you'll be able to tell the difference because did to be they'll be less smart words in the ones that I use but she Childhood trauma affects the brain development immune system hormones and the way our DNA is written.	
2	So this shit is in your DNA.	
3	People who experience it in extremely high doses are three times likelier to develop heart disease and lung disease or lung cancer. Excuse me.	
2	That is according to the CDC yet doctors aren't trained to recognize and treat this impatience. What the fuck? Yo its rampant.	
3	Some examples of childhood trauma and I've listed a shitload of them on this Google doc survey that's abuse neglect growing up with a parent with a mental illness ding ding ding or a substance abuse problem, which I didn't have but my mom's biological family.	
2	She was adopted but man her biological family.	
3	Oh violence abuse substance abuse.	
2	Oh God, it's so bad abuse neglect a divorce. People yelling at you witnessing violence witnessing your mom or your dad or your dad hit your mom.	
3	If you have a sibling that went apeshit in front of you divorced. I say that already parents yelling at definitely said that a lot of shit.	
2	So Nadine this badass angel she opened up a clinic in one of the poor area in the San Francisco area called Bayview and they provided all kinds of care for kids that was much needed in the community everything from like flu shots to you know, physical exam and she noticed a buttload of kids and those are obviously my words not her.	
3	She's smarter than me a buttload a big ol booty load a kid. Were being treated or being referred to her for ADHD. And she and she does these a sides during her Ted Talk that are like God you're badass.	
2	She points out that she's like when I was a medical school.	
3	This is an exact quote. I'm summarizing. This is pretty close to what she said, but she said when she was a medical school she touched she was taught by her professors in college that if 98% or night. I'm sorry 98 out of a hundred children, which is also 98% so funky know who drank from the same. I'm well 98 of them out of a hundred came down with diarrhea.	
2	You could prescribe them for prescriptions all goddamn day, or you could walk over and say what the fuck is in this well.	
3	And she didn't say fuck because she's better than me her College art her College her colleague.	
2	So and then she has this institution. She's like whoa. Whoa why he's all these motherfuckers have ADHD.	
3	I got to figure out there's a reason this doesn't make sense because she's smart lady and her colleague found this study that she Nadine credits to like changing the course of her career changing her life changing how she thinks about all this shit. The studies called the adverse childhood experience study and it asked 17,500 people about their History of exposure to adverse childhood experiences which could include but not limited to physical emotional or sexual abuse physical or emotional neglect being left alone at home as a child and I'm talking like one two, three, four, five six seven eight nine. I wanted to be alone more than I was but I think the first time I was allowed to stay home by myself. I think I was 11 and I don't know if that's where you're not because I'm not a parent so I don't fucking know but it was fine for me, but some people Gordon Your emails and some people that I know like they they were neglected when they were little kids.	
2	They were just home alone.	
3	And again, there's this thing where I say, like, my mom had a suicide attempt when I was on the phone with her, but she was on meds and she was on blah blah blah. I'm sure the reason that you were left home alone. If that was something that happened. He was a kid when you were a child, you know.	
2	Give your parents how to work and fucking if you live in America, it costs upwards of ten to thirty thousand dollars to have a baby in a hospital. Hope you have insurance. That's a billion dollars of fucking month. If you live in New York City that's exaggerated. But you know what I'm saying?	
3	So we're all trying our best but we get fucked up because we're not perfect and our parents are certainly not perfect. And this is why these fucking study and this is why she's the dean started this institute and is doing this fucking Ted Talk and why I'm doing this episode, so Actually, I 17,500 the study asked about the history of experience the adverse childhood shit sexual abuse physical neglect. Like I said parental mental illness substance dependence of car serration divorce separation domestic violence for every. Yes, you get one point. This is an ace score. Okay, and and there is a link to take this a square just take this quiz and they'll tell you what it means and a stands for. Adverse childhood experience. So for every fucked up thing, they're like, hey, this fucked-up thing happened for you. Yep was one point. That's one ace.	
2	It's like a fun game. How fucked up are you and then you could have a struggle off invite all your friends over Merry Christmas. Let's take out some whiskey and see who's the most fucked-up whoever is wins. So all this shit. So every time you if you have one of these experiences that I mentioned you get one ace like one score 67 motherfucking percent of the population of these people that were that were surveyed again 17,500 had at least one ace and not for nothing each one of these individual little things. That's an ace. They suck and where you're located they suck and you even know it sucks because you're like trying to fix shit 12.6% had four or more Aces. Which has so many men and a lot of you people that was emailing me you had for Maurices for you guys.	
3	according to this study people with four or more their risk of pulmonary disease was two point five times higher developing that then the a score of zero and you were 2.5 times likelier to develop hepatitis, 4.5 times likelier to develop depression boy 12.5 times likely to have suicidal thoughts and a score of 7 or more.	
2	Oh tripled their risk of lung cancer by three and a half. Yeah, but three times because triple 3.5 times.	
3	Cleared to develop heart disease, which is the number one killer of people in the United States of America. Oh my said I like that but I did you're likely to drink and smoke and get addicted to drugs because your brain develops differently.	
2	Well Goddamn that explains it, but just because look and this this entire episode is just hopefully lift the curtain on some of the bullshit that you've been going through that you may not know is there but after you realize it you're going to be like, oh fuck there's a period for me lasted a couple of years where I was like, oh, Oh fuck dude. Yo that shit was fucked up. But then eventually you got to take whatever time you need to like be like, oh fuck but then you got it.	
3	You got to do something about it. You got it, because you and trust me you can and I'll like go over that way cleaner. Okay, I'm down.	
2	You're likely to drink and smoke.	
3	Yeah, blah blah blah and that's why you know Adderall.	
2	Yeah, I drink pretty frequently.	
3	I don't drink a lot, but that's because I have a sensitive stomach, but that's because I got yelled at for as a kid for shit. I didn't do so, it's kind of cool because I don't eat cupcakes and shit because it gives me a stomachache anyway childhood trauma affects the nucleus accumbens. These are smart people words that Nadine use and that is the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance abuse God damn it. Okay, and it inhibits your prefrontal cortex all the like childhood trauma shut it inhibits your prefrontal cortex, which inhibits impulse control which is the area for critical thinking and learning.	
2	Oh, it's a critical area for learning. So ADHD when you can't pay attention in school, I'll maybe because your dad was punching your mom in the fucking face and then mrs. Wilson was like Billy the fuck's your problem and he's like, dude. I don't know. Because your shit wasn't crazy to use just your shit. How are you supposed to be like, you know teach my dad punched my mom in the face the other night and I feel like it's like going to affect me emotionally and while I don't really understand the consequences of it at this moment in time. It's going to have bad benefits for me later down the road. So maybe we should started no kid says that no kid says that and if you do your Doogie Howser, okay, and do we Hauser was made up and in MRIs, this is another thing from this study it there is a very clear difference between A traumatized brain and a regular brain. There's a the difference is very clear in the amygdala, which is your brains fear response Center. So I one thing my therapist is always told me is Christina you always invite a flight shouldn't talk like that but I wish you did Christina like you always invite a flight. So like you'd be walking on the street and then like something, you know, something happens.	
3	You know, what I'm going to I'm going to pause my own example on this because in the dean has a quote that I was like yo, it's summarize my point way better than I'm about to do but for me like big feelings trigger fear and I become truly paralyzed.	
2	I can't communicate like I don't even know what to feel and last less not last week when I walked in therapy because last week was Thanksgiving and I was like, can I Skype you and she's like dude.	
3	I didn't ask her that I should have though, but I saw her two weeks ago. And the first thing I said when I sat down it's like dude, I don't know how I feel.	
2	And I'm so I want to know if you are neurologically wired to engage in high-risk Behavior. Oh, you are neurologically that was a statement from Nadine and her Ted Talk your neurologically wired because what it does is it changes your brain chemistry. So your brain is physically different so you can't fucking tell me you can't yell at me. Like it's your fault you piece of shit. You're addicted to Adderall and you overreact and blah blah blah.	
3	I'm just using me as an example because I know me pretty well.	
2	But you can't come up to me and be like why the fuck you an addict or like it's an Adderall. Why the fuck you freak out? Why the fuck didn't you know, you feel pitch my brain is different. Okay, once I learned that I felt so much better because I didn't feel stupid. I felt really like stupid to be on it.	
3	Like that's the only way I could describe I felt stupid for not knowing how I felt because there's so many instances in my life where I'm so articulate.	
2	But like the last that a guy that I was seeing this past year every time he would like go to talk to me about feelings and stuff or let you know it wasn't often but whenever he did I wanted to say things but nothing came out. It was like Ursula just came in like bitch your voice box is mine, but Ursula was trauma.	
3	Do you like my little mermaid references think about all those are not in the reserve on my website the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal access access that is your brain stress response that is responsible for fight or flight.	
2	And when you are hyper aroused as a child when there is a perceived threat to your safety and that perceived that can come in the form of your mother throwing something at your face or whatever the fuck.	
3	Your fight-or-flight.	
2	It's gonna go and it's our time to shine. But the fucked up thing about that is when your adult your fight or flight is also like it's our time to shine but ain't nobody throwing shit at your head.	
3	There's just a bird flying by and you're like what?	
1	the fuck	
3	but this also explains why I am fucking clutch in emergency situations and why I want to volunteer.	
2	I've trained to volunteer to work with sexual abuse cases in the emergency room of Bellevue because I've there's I'm hard on myself, but I'm also I think I'm pretty aware of the things that I'm good at. I think I'm getting better at it. One of the things I've always noticed that myself as like damn. I am so clutch and emergency. I have called 9-1-1 on Strangers in New York, and I'm not talking for both. Shit, someone had to have been bleeding.	
3	I'm not going to just call 9-1-1 and I don't like the part like this. I'm not one of those ladies. Okay, please all those ladies suck so bad. I'm not one of those ladies.	
2	I've called nine one one. I've seen I witnessed domestic abuse so much on the streets of New York City.	
3	I witnessed an elder not elderly 60s. Sorry, you're not old early in your 60s. But like a 60 years year old couple a man slammed his wife's face into the pavement really really hard and I call 9-1-1 and Iran at the man and I got the woman a bottle of water and I very reluctantly got the man a bottle of water because I could tell he was intoxicated and even though he just hit his wife and that is not what love is and that is not how you health. We express love. I thought that maybe he could use some water too. And then the ambulance took the guy wakes at like pump his stomach or whatever the fuck and then the ladies like can you what we to my hotel she was from a really tiny Country Town in England.	
2	But my point in saying that is when that happened when I saw that I was like, oh I'm on it. I know exactly what to do. I'm going to call 9-1-1 first. I want to make sure she's away from this guy. I'm gonna go to the deli Amigo. I am so good at that shit and when my mother It's hard to talk about but I hope every time I talk about it.	
3	That means like a little bit of it goes away because I really don't want to relive this shit every time I bring it up but I think about a lot when my when the suicide attempt thing happened and my mom like ran off in our neighborhood and I didn't know where she was and she was hopped up on pills and and that happened and she called me and I thought basically I thought she was gonna jump in front of a train. She told me she was and I heard the train in the background and it was the day before I moved away, too. State and I was so excited to for college but I was like, okay, but when that happened when a family friend called the house was like a we found your mom's we'd been looking for her. It's like your mom's on the other line. I'm going to patch you through but don't say anything hang up.	
2	If you know, you're there like I when that happens, I'll never forget those moments because I'm like, okay got it. We're not going to talk Dad. Don't say anything like I should so like a like a like a like one of those guys when you're playing lands and he's got the big headphones in and they'll and and the orange dicks in his hand orange dildos in his hand. He's like your plan you go that way like that was me. If oh, okay. This is the quote. This is the goddamn quote Oh Nadine so good.	
3	If you see a bear your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary gland to release all the stress hormones, like cortisol. Your heart rate goes up your pupils dilate as you prepare to fight that motherfucking bear or run from that mother fucking bear. I graciously inserted the motherfucking perchance a then or Ted Talk.	
2	That's an exact quote. That's all fine. And dandy when there's an actual bear.	
3	But what is but the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night. Yo, Nadine Burke Harris.	
1	Oh that line by line. Got me.	
2	I felt like I was like in up in I've never been in the military or before but I'm like like I felt like all the because I've been reading these emails from you guys. I only put it I put it on the last episode. I I said, hey email me a summary of your childhood trauma. I tweeted it once and then I put it on my Instagram stories once let me tell you something over a thousand emails and it will man it got and when I but I was I was reading them.	
3	I was like you guys were all superheroes were like members of the Jurors, you know we all got different strengths because of our trauma. I'm clutching emergency situations.	
2	But then if someone asked me how you feeling I'm like, I don't know but if somebody, you know punches lady in the face, I'm like, here's what we do I got mace is that legal in New York or is it pepper spray? Let me know but what happens when the bear comes home every night.	
3	Oh, oh and that my friends is life with trauma your yeah, you're neurologically wired to engage in high-risk behaviors and yet even if you don't engage in these high-risk behaviors. Oh, this is also toured over Ted Talk. That was like are you fucking kidding? Even if you don't engage in these behaviors and you have a high a score so you have a lot of shit that's happened to you. You're just as likely to develop heart disease or cancer. So like you might as well smoke.	
2	No just kidding. Just kidding. That is not good advice. Do not listen to me but full disclosure because I can't lie to you. I wish I could it would probably behoove me if I could like or not even lie, but like what not. Just tell you every fucking thing, you know oversharing that's one of my things that I got to work on but I smoke cigarettes.	
3	I know you're probably waiting for like some other bomb to drop you like we know we see your stories. I do I smoke cigarettes. Never mind, that's not logical thinking but I do plan on quitting one day. I think we'll see we all need our vices. What's your Vice is heroin or opioids or meth? That's not good basis. You gotta get a different one. Maybe like take up knitting. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis already talked about that.	
2	Okay.	
3	So yeah, so your fight or flight system. It's constantly operating when you're a child and you're experiencing traumatic events, but you're supposed to reserve that system ideally in an Ideal World. You don't grow up in a traumatized environment and that system is reserved when we actually fucking need it. But because it's always active you held on get fucked up because your fight or flight system is always like wassup wassup wassup wassup. It's like you're in Los Angeles in a nice restaurant the second the door opens you like is that Bruce Willis, huh Will Smith Britney Spears. No, it's just me, but your fight or flight system.	
2	It's always acting up and that fucks your shit up, dude.	
1	Isn't this so scientifically?	
2	Yeah, it is and what happens when it's a little kid their neurological systems.	
3	They're not ready. They can't handle these big emotions and that's the thing my therapist like Christina your body couldn't handle these big emotions. So it did the only thing I knew how to do and it's shoved it deep down in a hole and I have to deal with that. They are not wired to process.	
2	They meeting kids to process this fucking shit that happens to them and it fuck's up your actual DNA. Your DNA is written differently when extreme extreme trauma is encountered like the fucking Holocaust or slavery. Those things are such trauma. I can't even I mean, I don't fucking know but oh my God. So on top of all this shit, it's just like when it's something is that extreme like the Holocaust are slavery and Trauma fucks up your DNA what the fuck you think you know what I mean like, come on. I don't know who I'm yelling at but but there's some good news. So Nadine she's an angel. She created a Center for Youth Wellness to prevent to do prevention screenings to prevent screen and he'll you girl don't do commas when she types.	
3	So they she created a center to prevent screen and heal the impacts of Aces. She already knew that the increased likelihood of patients with high scores is develop disease. So for those patients, she created a comprehensive treatment team who tackled nutrition mental.	
2	Healthcare home visits Etc medication when necessary cognitive therapy when necessary bilateral music shit.	
3	That's what my therapist does with me where she gives me these headphones from 1992 and the CD player and I was like wait, where'd you get this a vault and she's like shut up and I listen to music and like and it's in one ear and then the other and she says it does something to me. I forget what it was, but you can look it up later. Okay. I already looked up a lot of stuff for this episode and the big thing that she does in the center.	
2	She educates the parents the same way way you could you would tell a parent, you know, when you're in the hospital and have a baby the nurse shows you how to breastfeed and there's certain there's parenting classes. You could take that say Hey, you got electrical outlets in your house and you have a toddler put a cover on them. No one says hey your child, maybe, you know experiencing adverse shit, especially when it's the parent doing the thing. I don't even know how that conversation works.	
3	I'm sure there's a way that they navigate that dance to be like, oh you fucking a kid up and they say it in like a nice way or some shit.	
2	Maybe. I don't know.	
3	I don't know what she does but that's a really big idea educating parents. That's so important.	
2	Because when you begin to understand the science you oh this is I said it like I was saying this because I put it in quotes but this isn't the Deans words not mine.	
3	This is Nadine's word.	
2	When you begin to understand the science you want to shout it from the rooftops.	
3	Like she basically is just so excited that she's figuring all this shit out because she can create this comprehensive medical team. I figured that whenever anybody else heard about this, it would encourage routine screenings multidisciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.	
2	That did not happen. What I Stories best clinical practice.	
3	I Now understand to be a movement. And so she created the opportunity Institute because there's not a lot of education and there's not a lot of treatment plans does your family doctor ask you if you've experienced childhood trauma, probably not they should this should be something that everybody is taught in medical school because we I don't know look I'm not obviously not a doctor surprise not a doctor.	
2	But Jesus Christ were putting Band-Aids on shit. Oh, here's Adderall. You got 80 you can't pay attention in school. Well, maybe it's cause my dad's punching my mom and they'll fucking face but no one asks you this shit and you need to be asked because no matter what race you are. What age you are what economic background you are. You're not immune to experiencing any of these things and then on top of those things if you do come from a poor background and you got to do with that bullshit, The government's laws wherever you are in the world the United States. I don't know where ever keep you down or they prevent you from seeking the help you need from for medical costs and you don't go to the ER because you don't health insurance and you don't want to bill so you just fucking sit there and go I guess I'll WebMD it and web and he's like bitch. It's cancer. You don't even have to type anything in WebMD. You just go to WebMD and it auto generates is because bitches cancer Sorry by a Merry Christmas like it's not helping. So basically she was like, hey guys you all on board with this. Look at this crazy shit. We rediscovered this this this survey this fucking study. That was so cool. And I was like, I knew there was some fucked up with these ADHD kids.	
3	I'm re-enacting what I imagined the Deans like reaction to be about learning all this shit and everyone's like yeah, but like big Pharma or whatever they said.	
2	But it blows my mind that this is not a more common thing that has talked about. There's another Ted Talk by this woman Danny Bostic.	
3	It's called breaking the Silence about childhood trauma and I have that link on the website and she talks about this is interesting things that I thought were cool from. This Ted Talk is a lot of members of the military have PTSD and that is a safe way to talk about it because it happened so far away and it happens to very strong people who made a who made a sacrifice for a noble cause so it's like we're more comfortable talking about that than a Being raped and that's fucking bullshit. We should absolutely talk about military people with PTSD because most homeless people in the city that I currently live in our veterans and my dad was a veteran.	
2	He doesn't have PTSD that I know of but that's so common.	
3	And then the VA says getting it a whole new topic because I my dad has military health insurance, but like there's some rules with the VA bullshit where if you live too close to a VA hospital, my dad is champa's that's the military shit, but he has to also I pay for additional. What is it called supplemental health insurance.	
2	I don't think it's that much for him.	
3	But there's certain rules where you live too close to a VA. You have to drive to the next one which is bullshit.	
2	The next one is in Kentucky by I mean, I don't know where but a lot of times and then if you have a job or you make ten fucking dollars an hour and you have multiple children, oh, so you got to take expect to be at take a day off work two days off work find someone to watch your kids or take your kids with you take them out of school and then gas money if you Car bus ticket whatever the fuck Uber to Kentucky. It's a lot of money. So being broke also exacerbates all the shit. But this Ted Talk was really good.	
3	She talks about her personal experience. She was sexually abused by her swim coach between the ages of 7 and 12 and she didn't realize it until she was older. She was like fuck dude. And so reading all this shit and I hope that you watch this shit later and get that this can happen to anybody and I hope people who are not didn't have traumatized childhoods are also listening to this and we'll also take that Google doc survey because I'm just curious how many of you have experienced childhood trauma. So like I don't know if you could see the results after the survey. If not, I'll just share them but I'm curious of how many people take it how many of you have childhood trauma. How many like how bad was it Bob? What else do I want to say? I didn't realize I was trying things on College already told you that oh and the memory loss the woman who gave this Ted Talk Danny. She said she has no memory of her trauma, but but she had the feelings that had happened to her. So she was getting triggered by various things and she's like what the fuck and she has no memory of the actual trauma happening because kids again resilient survival mode you do this without even thinking oh, this is a good quote does good quote. She says trauma is like Gravity You don't notice it and you take it for granted. Children are the most disenfranchised group in the world. Sometimes they look okay, but they are not. Okay. Okay before I read off this shit.	
2	There's some things that have helped me and this is there's a section in this Google quiz shit thing. I would probably work better.	
3	Um, where I ask if you have anything that's helped you that was not listed the something I didn't talk about. That has helped you whether it's a book or a video or thinking or meditation or I don't fucking know put it put it, right it there's like a short form question thing where you write that if you have it, so let's all share the resources for me. These are the things have worked for me the book the body keeps score. Because it talks about talks about PTSD in in soldiers. That one is a really intense book and it it details sexual assault that happened to kids child rape because the patient's it happened to them and I don't like I'm when I say I'm comfortable talking about child rape. Its I'm not comfortable because I like the idea. I'm comfortable because this happens so fucking much that we better fucking get comfortable talking about it because if we're not comfortable talking about it. That's how it's going to happen. So for me anyway, ciao cognitive therapy has helped me bilateral music shit that helped me. My therapist does this thing with me called Earth breathing where I sit on the couch with my feet firmly planted on the floor and shoes and I imagine that there's a ball of energy. This is what she told me in the center of the center of the earth and it comes up through my right leg. She said pick whatever leg I picked my right leg and comes up all the so when I breathe in this energy comes out from the center of the earth through my right leg and up to my head and then down my left. - its relaxing as hell. It really is. It's very relaxing. Sometimes I'll be in therapy and she'll be like hey, are you calm now?	
2	I'm like, I don't know. She's like are you and then I'm like my foots tapping on my limit and I'm like, yeah fucking fly.	
3	I don't say like that. I mean we're so Earth breathing helps and then breathing out Vu Vu like breathing in and going Vu like that that does something to some are your brain that makes tired calms you down. And so all this stuff and all this thinking and doing all this research and kind of compiling this episode for you. I look back to some of my childhood like things I said on guys we've talked like I masturbated a lot as a kid, but I I wonder if like, my body was like Hey girl, here's some orgasms because you had it rough like just not like like a way to let off steam. I wonder if that's why I did it all the time because let me tell you that my dad all the time and I think that was a healthy thing. That is to discover. I wasn't harming myself.	
2	Although I did think that any day now I'm going to get pregnant any day. I was six Any day now, there's going to be a baby and I have to tell my mom had sex with the couch or the banister that's stuffed horse.	
3	One thing that has been kind of fucked up from all this the shit that I've gone through is my gut I don't I didn't even know how to get to the hey this is your gut voice in my head. But recently my gut is actually my gut instincts have been like dead on recently. There's certain like little tiny things that have happened where it's a very distinct like my gut is telling me that this is this is the situation and I've been right and I'm like yo girl look at you.	
2	And then before I I'm going to read some examples and they're really heavy.	
3	Okay, and while while a lot of us me I have trauma and it's the cause of a lot of my woes trust me when I say that you can move past it. And it takes a lot of work and a lot of pain it's not fun, but man it's kind of cool because when you go to these dark corners of your mind through therapy, that's how I recommend it.	
2	Everybody should be in therapy. But especially if you've experienced any of this shit and if you can't afford a therapist may be one of those books I talked about But we got to work on ourselves and then we but we can't get stuck in like I'm this way because my mommy did the thing that the bababa, you know, we can't like okay this happened now, we understand it cool for me understanding why operate the way I operate is very helpful because then I can move on with it. And then and then for me my goal is to kind of get over it if again get the fuck over it and that's not to say that	
3	It's any bullshit on my part if I can't sometimes or if it comes back, that's normal. That's a human brain. Like it's you have to have empathy for yourself.	
2	Oh man, my therapist. I was being really hard on myself or something and and she goes. Hey, can you just have some empathy for yourself real quick? And I was like, wait what like I didn't even comprehend what that meant. And it's so funny because I have empathy for so many fucking types of people.	
3	I have talked to people that have done Terrible Things via email anonymously, but like, you know, like people who are rapists and shit because I like wanted to like do like a I don't know. I wanted to just get into that and why the fuck it happens so much like technically a rapist has to have be listening to this two guys.	
2	We fucked make a fake email and tell me why the fuck you rape, dude. And I was in a pie. I'm in a position where that doesn't trigger me or bother me, but if it did I wouldn't do that. But anyway, you know, I can I can I want to understand why everybody operates the way they operate but the same time I can't fucking give myself a break or I'm learning. That's I gotta change the way I talk. I'm learning to give myself a break. So about I'm about to read some examples and I encourage you.	
3	I mean I was getting sad and crying when I was reading these These are intense. These are really intense, but I encourage you not to	
2	I didn't get so sad as much as I felt like this camaraderie and if you're and if you're listening to this and you've not experienced any of this shit, maybe just have maybe this will increase your empathy for other people.	
3	The only person I know truly the only person in my life, I know maybe my dad maybe but who knows the only person in my life without childhood trauma and believe me, she has her own problems. We all do if you just just cause you haven't experienced childhood trauma doesn't mean you have a motherfucking problems. So you can get traumatized as an adult, but it's current Fisher my comedy partner.	
2	Damn, that woman knows how to handle her life.	
3	Who and I'm very lucky to have her as my comedy partner and and because she's like the my living example that it's possible to love yourself.	
2	It's really truly possible to like really dig yourself and then if you fuck up you go, okay, I fucked up. It's all right. You know, we are in the entertainment industry.	
3	You got to get a Tino's before you get a yes so every I mean and that's my glass half-full thinking but I'm like, let's get to these nose baby so we can get to that fucking yes, but like and that's where I my positive attitude comes in and that's good and that helps us but like for her, she's just like it's okay. Well, we'll figure it out. Like she's kind of like got it and it's great. It's great to have somebody that in my life. That's an example of that and we talked about that a lot on guys we fucked because we're both going through our own Journeys, and I'm going to plug guys we fucked really quick. I'm not trying to like do an ad or anything, but if you A broke bitch and you live in the US UK Australia or Canada?	
2	I wish it was available everywhere and they are working on it.	
3	And I know that's what I keep saying, but it's true. I don't have any other answers for you. Other than that. But anyway, if you're broke, you're broke bitch, you can sign up for luminary right now. I think it's like one more day. You can get 399 for the first year with a four month free. Just FYI. I don't think I mentioned that on any of my social media. I should probably promote that because there's only one day left. God do luminary dot link / G WF that's the link to it. It and get 399 blah blee blah. Okay. Anyway, I will say yeah as far as okay. So as far as hard scuse me as hard as it is to reach into these crevices of your brain and figured that you know, these are the things that happen when you're trying to figure itself out and go. Oh, well that's what happened to me. It's really fucking hard, but it's really worth it. And when you work through the shit, it's like it's like you're being introduced to yourself for the first time.	
2	That's I don't know. That's the only way I can describe it for me.	
3	That's then. That's me.	
2	And it's such a beautiful feeling. It's a really beautiful feeling and it's better than any drug. I promise. Okay ready?	
3	I'm going to read some emails and these are a bunch so And these are from Men Women of various ages, but I'm not going to specify that because I this is all Anonymous. Okay, so I'll like take a pause I guess in between each one.	
2	You'll know when I was three.	
3	My mom had a brain aneurysm instead of my mom taking care of me. I had to learn how to take care of my mom and myself. My dad had to focus most of his energy on my mom and my 13 year old brother who turned to hard drugs to cope with it because Mom would always be handicapped and never an independent person. I was left in the dust and had to figure out life on my own. I'm not 23 and dealing with all the trauma that With that not being cared for emotionally because my dad didn't have any nurturing didn't have a nurturing side to him. My mom was always the balance I needed in my life that I never got it that I never got. I've been a caretaker for my mom since I was 3 and now I barely know how to take care of myself because I'm always thinking of other people first. No one ever took care of me. So how do I even take care of me?	
2	Oh that one hit home. Okay, next one. So when I was in fifth grade, my dad was accused of molesting a high school girl.	
3	He was a teacher he was found not guilty, but After the trial, I found naked pictures of my brother's underage girlfriend who was also in high school at the time of this happening. Then after that he slept with another one of my boyfriend's girlfriend's who was who was he was in love with? Oh, I found out this years later, but that shit fucked me up fam to paraphrase. He fucked two of my brother's girlfriends in high school. Oh Brothers girlfriends. So T fuck two of my brother's girlfriends in high school. This is her dad. I never looked at my dad the same and I wonder if anything actually happened with that girl who accused him welp. Guess I'll never know also after all this happened my mom became a raging alcoholic and pill Pusher and was never the same again the end. My biggest trauma is that my dad repeatedly molested me when I was five to six and I tried to tell my mom about it when I was 13, but she didn't believe me. They are still married and I still have to see him at every family gathering. I feel so worn out from the trauma. I carry around every day. I know there are other people out there who are also experiencing this I just haven't met anyone. So hopefully if you do read my story maybe it will resonate with somebody and the weight can be lifted from them a little bit the hardest part about this trauma is how tell boo it is to talk about it. The people I've told always give the Same sad look that I'm just so tired of seeing I feel Airline dated from everybody. I know especially my family the second hardest part about having this trauma is how difficult it is to live a productive life. I have two jobs and I still can't pay my bills. I feel such little drive to try at things and reach for my dreams growing up. I had so many dreams and goals and as I get older, I feel them all slipping away from me. I know deep down it's because of my shitty self-worth and feeling like I don't matter I wish I could just relive another person's life sometimes but I have to tell myself there's worse things that could have happened and I'm thankful for the life. I do have I've also been going to therapy which has helped. That's great. I get free therapy through my local Domestic Violence Shelter, which I had to go to because of my not so surprising addiction to abusive men. So if anyone out there needs us resource shelters are great for that. Oh good to know anybody at any way. This is way longer than I wanted to bubble. Bubble Bubble Bum, and it sounds Probably sounds a lot. Sadder than how I feel at the moment. That's good. I feel okay just tired. When I was eight my mom and dad put me on a this one's this one's for when I was eight my mom and dad put me on a plane to India. They are both from there with my paternal grandmother. My mom and I both thought I was just going to learn where I came from and come back home to Canada and a few weeks instead. As soon as I landed on Indian soil my dad's sisters and their husbands took my return ticket and they ripped it up. They told me my mother and father sold me and no longer wanted me what was supposed to be a fun two week vacation. India turned into two long years. I was physically sexually mentally abused throughout that time. They put me in an Indian School where everyone spoke the native language with me. I didn't speak to my they spoke the language to me. I assume she means I didn't speak to my mother at all and started to believe she did send me away. My dad came to visit once I cried so hard and leaped into his arms at this point. He was painted as a saint to me and my mother was a terrible evil woman who was mean to my dad and my other sibling who still lived in Canada. He was a boy and therefore my dad wanted to keep him close and he was aware of the abuse going on. Actually. He encouraged it to you. Later on summer break a car pulled up in my maternal grandparents were in it.	
2	Keep in mind.	
3	I hated them because they were supposedly In Cahoots with my evil mother. They put me in the car and took me to the airport a few days later. I was back in Canada at the airport.	
2	My mom was waiting for me.	
3	I hit her. I kicked her. I punched her in the face. I was an angry ten-year-old little girl.	
2	Long story short. I was diagnosed with PTSD and Stockholm syndrome. I wanted to go back to India.	
3	It's been eighteen years since I came back it took six years of being on two to seven pills out of time being on suicide watch at a children's hospital therapy and going to a special school for a few years to help me be somewhat normal again, and I haven't spoken to my father in six years and I recently learned that my mother who didn't sell me. Okay? Yeah.	
2	She said that all caps who did not sell me paid him close to $100,000 to get me back. Oh shit, but I wouldn't take it back. I had had I stayed there or never even	
3	Left Canada, I would have probably been married off at 20 and had three kids by now instead. I'm on my way to becoming a cop.	
2	Oh and I feel like I've broken this East Indian cycle of abuse in my family. I still get bad thoughts and anytime I see a dad or a daughter together.	
3	It seems weird to me like he's a creeper something. I can't see that relationship purely anymore. That makes sense. I had a tough time with relationships for a while in my relationship with my mom isn't so great, but I'm fucking here.	
2	damn, dude, damn girl shit Thanks for thank you everybody for okay, there's there's a lot more there's more.	
3	I'm not gonna it's not gonna go on forever. But these are the ones that I'm like I try to cook some diverse ones too, like of just various situations at the age. Okay. So this person lists their three things at the age of four seeing my dad in a blackout drunk drug binge threatening my mom with a rifle my mom managed to get my two sisters out to the neighbors and called the police. I was left in the house with my dad and my baby brother was in the other room and his crib the police surrounded the house trying to negotiate surrender SWAT. Ended up breaking in through the back to Rescue us. I have a clear memory of my dad sitting next to me on the couch holding his rifle and trying to comfort me as I cry. Hysterically. I can also clearly remember a SWAT officer boosting Me Over The Back Fence to awaiting officer at the age of 12 and older man. I met off the internet came to my house. He had sex with me taking my virginity without ever asking for consent. It wasn't violent. He wasn't forceful, but I did not feel in control or able to say no at Okay at the age of 13, my dad told me that he has HIV. This is all the same person. This is the last one that this person wrote to me the age of three or four times aren't they? Just 13. My dad told me he has HIV. He insisted that I cannot tell my siblings for the next six months. I have no one to talk to lean or to lean on well, I was processing and grieving this it sent me into a deep depression where function was nearly impossible as a 31 year old woman now, I resent his selfishness in forcing me to keep such a secret. Here's another person. I don't talk about this with many people or like ever at all when I was four. I was sexually abused by a girl who was a bit older than me. I remember the sexual abuse happening like it's not buried in my mind, but apparently I went for counseling and I have zero memory of it. Sometimes I worry if I just think I'm bisexual because of this experience, which is really fun smiley face. Here's another one. I started getting molested and raped by my oldest brother's best friend. When I was five. He was 12, he would hide me under the bunk bed. Say I was his Queen and he was my king. He when we got up when we got too big to hide under the bunk bed. He would make sure my brothers were distracted with games and he would take me to the closet and rape me. It stopped when I was 11 because my parents found out because I had wrote a note to my best friend telling her I was scared and confused. Jeff was 18 at this point my parents talked to his It's the raping stopped but Jeff was still allowed over our house that is really just the start of the trauma because after knowing they did nothing and they didn't really care really fucked with me. And that though my mom started beating me. Oh Jesus after I was right after that my mom started beating and abusing me verbally saying she hated me and wished she would have killed me. Now I'm 30 and have a halfway decent relationship with my parents after years of therapy and multiple trips to the psych ward Jesus. Okay, this other person list them. Number one, my father was travel for business and was out of town six to seven days per week. My mom held it down but they would fly they would fight horribly in the daisy was home to Thanksgiving when I was 10 my mom found out that my dad had been cheating on her with multiple women including one long-term relationship three, my parents divorced my dad married his longtime mistress. Only because one of my now stepsisters is his actual daughter for my dad moved to England with his new family. And as I got older I would occasionally visit him. I came to realize he had a horrible drinking problem that my mom hid from us. I was excited when I turned 16, so I didn't have to be the in the car with him while he was drinking and driving anymore. Jeez. It was illegal for me to drive in England but safer than him driving I fell in love when I was 16 with a boy who took his own life on our third-year anniversary. Oh my God. I'm still in love with him five years later one sec.	
2	Six saw one person one year after my lover's death.	
3	I had just turned 20 at this point. I found myself and physical in a physically and sexually abusive relationship. I kept going back because of how painful my survivors go was it's fucked up, but I was punishing myself with this horrible person. Seven I go. I got out found help. I'm doing much better now, but I still have daddy issues and I was diagnosed with bipolar to I believe strongly that my mental illness is strongly linked to my childhood trauma. Okay. This is another person only a couple more when I was a toddler. My mom tried to Talked my dad into murdering me damn and then themselves from then on my dad trained me to survive no matter what even if it meant killing my own Mom God damn it saved me from her many murder. Oops, and it saved me from when I was homeless teenager, but now I equate guns with safety and revert to feeling like a helpless four-year-old about to be thrown down a flight of stairs.	
2	Every time someone talks about banning them see fucking that purse I would call I would sack I would I can't fucking talk. That's a trigger if someone like so if I don't know who wrote this guy or girl one, but if someone's bringing up gun safety and you get that heated you probably emotionally triggered so, you know, maybe this is one of the reasons why political discourse a little fucking heart	
3	Okay, here's another person when I was five. My next door Neighbour six-year-old son. Also, my regular babysitter would molest and rape me after telling my mom. She physically beat an injured before telling lies. Here's another one in my motions and feelings were dismissed. My parents wouldn't care. If I was crying. My mom is an extended family and salt and belittle me.	
2	My dad would choose my siblings Joe.	
3	Would Chase my siblings and I with a belt and whip us for being annoying. I'm the only sibling carrying the emotional burden on my parents short separation when I was 10 depression came early for me never felt love or compassion from family.	
2	Okay? Here's one. My best friend's uncle died. I'm sorry.	
3	My best friend died when I was eight and no one told me why my cousin died when I was 10. My parents divorced when I was 15 my uncle died when I was 16, then there's the college bulimia sexual assault depression Suicidal Tendencies and anxiety, but that's more adulthood. Okay. Oh when I was nine, I watched my brother 14 at the time go through mental breakdown and come within inches of stabbing our mother. He snapped at he snapped out of it after a few minutes and put the knife down to this day. My mom still finds random knives that I took out of the kitchen and hid from him. Okay, two more two more as if being a hormonal e or hormonal 13 year old wasn't enough to make me feel awkward rejected and alone, my father committing suicide really drove all that home for me for me. This was the ultimate rejection by the man who was supposed to love me and show me how I should be loved as an adult. Okay, huh?	
2	That one hit home who showed me how I should be loved in as an adult.	
3	I'm now 31 and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and complex PTSD.	
2	I've got a I've gone a long way.	
3	I got a long way to go and a ton of shit to unravel, but super proud to say that I'm kicking life's ass. Okay, this is the last one. I'm going to read. My mom had a ruptured brain aneurysm when I was seven. It happened during sex. So my dad thought she was climaxing, but she was actually losing Consciousness. I woke up to I woke up to him naked screaming and sobbing the ambulance came and took her away during surgery. She flatlined they saved her but lost part of her brain when she was in a coma lived in the ICU lived in a rehab center then she finally came home a year later.	
1	She was seven down but never recovered.	
3	My dad worked almost constantly to cover the medical bills and keep us afloat. So I rarely saw him my mom coped with her new life in deep depression with substance abuse. I dealt with that and physical abuse from one of my brothers both of which got worse and worse as time went on for example, he would beat me up while I was sleeping drag me down the stairs and duct tape me to the wall by my hair. My mom picked me up from school drunk if she even came at all and once hit a Tree with me in the car when we took the car away. She rode my school bus to the gas station to get wine. Oh when we were told the driver when we told the driver and took her ID. She hitchhiked and had others buy alcohol for her when we took her cash when we took her cash and she got fired from her final job at Wendy's and couldn't make money anymore. She's some finally stayed at home, but somehow still got wine.	
2	The fuck you getting his wine. She got drunk once and forgot.	
3	She was cooking and didn't notice the house was burning down. Oh boy. We lost everything in that fire. My dad and I lived in a shitty Super 8 hotel room while they investigated processed insurance and rebuilt. My brother stayed with friends. We sent my mom to live at a rehab Sasha assisted living facility. I was 14 at the time and I've been taking care of her ever since she never improved mentally or physically and had two more Strokes. She's now partially paralyzed / disabled incontinence and with very different and difficult personality, but sober my dad died suddenly when I was 29 a heart attack while mowing the lawn And I became her legal guardian ho boy I consider myself an orphan who definitely had a traumatic childhood.	
2	But and this is why save this email for the last one.	
3	She says, this is my happy happier adulting.	
2	I am now trained in trauma informed parenting and am a licensed foster and adoptive parent. My husband and I are all are about to welcome our first little dude for adoption in a couple weeks. Assuming all goes as planned.	
3	I work at a women's Leadership Institute. Raising the confidence aspirations and Leadership skills of high school girls across state many of whom have traumas of their own.	
2	I also serve on a board for a dance organization coach cheering and gymnastics practice yoga volunteer with youth and immigrants guide damn girl. You're good have a few rescue animals. Jesus travel the world 43 countries and Counting make art and make a whole lot of love my mother. My mom and brother are still challenging and I'm still grateful. Being the loss of my father but life is much much much better. So in conclusion If if you have the time take the survey that I made up in the description of his bio. I'm reading I read all those emails in the hopes of making you feel less alone.	
3	I hope that that's what that did.	
2	Or if anything, if you if you have no relation to these experiences in and you don't even know can't even comprehend these honestly good for fucking you and I'm sure you have your own shit that's not included in all of this shit. We all have our shit and that's why I'll say it to the day. I die and do this podcast still it's a miracle we often kill ourselves and one book. There's this book the body keeps score that talks about childhood trauma another book that's on the resource section of the website is called feeling good. By David, but it's called. Yeah feeling good. Now.	
3	We're feeling good shit. I think it's called feeling good. It's by David Burns the Lincoln all the shit in the proper titles in my website. But but so that this book by David Burns first I had to do the work to be like, oh that shit was traumatic that shit was fucked up and then it's like, okay. Well now what are we gonna do about it? Because like cool cool cool.	
2	I can blame my mom all day so I could say what else because this is the good news.	
3	This is a good news that I think is very exciting and very promising we can we	
2	Endless we can contribute to ending this by helping ourselves and by being curious and by talking about this shit and by sharing our experiences and by not keeping things in and by seeking therapy and by reading books and by talking to one another and bye. Treating everybody that you encounter in your day-to-day with kindness truly truly because I think of all the times that I've had an interaction with a customer service or somebody with a guy the guy or girl was just being a fucking dick and then one side of into all this shit. I'm like, I have no idea you just listen all those emails. I read do you fuckin think you're gonna know that that's what that person been through went through when you have like this really short interaction with them. I'm not saying it's fine if people are dead. But I'm I am saying that there's a reason they are and maybe they don't know that they're traumatized yet it maybe that's not even what it is. But just let's have some empathy and be kind to people like that's like the one thing that I think we should all be doing. All the time is just we have it in us just be kind to people because life is hard. It's so hard. It's so hard man. And for all the people I've just read that their experiences that's hard. So so this book Feeling Good by David Burns is actually gives you some tips a titty this guy. It's really great. It's kind of clinical but I like the way I listened to the audiobook of this I had the	
3	And I was like, I don't have time I gotta listen to the audiobook. I listened to the audiobook over and over again until the shit sticks and a basically encourages you to challenge your own thinking.	
2	So one thing that I think all the time is like I'm a lazy piece of shit and then David Burns would be like Christina. Is that true not what's not true. I did all this. I'm sitting in front of this beautiful Christmas tree that I decorated in under two hours ago me and like I said, I'm not lazy, but I tell myself I am like we kind of the voices in our heads can sometimes be really fucking me. Mean, so I think in order to make any sort of improvements, we need to start with being kinder to ourselves dude, dude. He got to be kind to yourself. So I hope you enjoyed this episode. I'm going to make next week's episode like real light and funny don't you worry take the survey. I'm keeping the donations my Aunt Wendy who's my mom's biological sister sister speaking of childhood trauma, they grew up their biological mother before they were adopted tried to murder them many times and	
3	Why they were put into foster care. My mom was there was attempted murder on my mom and her sister Wendy and apparently the a muskrat soup according to the court documents fucked up, right but Wendy who is I'm I just reconnected with and I'm really happy.	
2	She lives a very simple life in Arizona on a horse farm in a trailer and she doesn't have a lot of money and one of her horses that she loves very much had this freak injury where he scraped his bones and I have a go fund me. I'm gonna keep it up for another week. If you have like a dolly just a dollar. It doesn't mean it hasn't had to be anything, but I just wanted to you know, The goal is I think 3500 and I'll make sure it gets to like I'm gonna donate I'm donating a bunch of money to but just to see I don't know I want the world for her. And so if people can donate $1 you can and if not, don't fucking worry about it.	
3	Seriously. Don't worry about it life is expensive and shits fucked up. So don't feel guilty. Not that you would but that was more for younger me. All right guys, so and also the meetings that I talked about going to that links also on the resources adult children of Alcoholics in dysfunctional families. I went to those meetings with Mike In friend Justin silver and they've helped me but then I didn't need them anymore because I was like, all right, this is enough. I don't need this.	
2	So take things with grains of salt and understand that it's kind of also possible to get addicted to self-help and maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's a bad thing everybody's different but just know like okay take some time to go rollerblading or some shit. You know what I mean? Take some time to do fun shit. Take some time to go to the zoo or whatever. I don't know whatever you think is fun color. So what? What I'm doing right now after this, I'm going over my friend is house and she has the cutest daughter the Cutest Child I've ever seen in my whole entire life. Her daughter is named dizzy, and I wanted to I texted her today and I was like, dude.	
3	Can I come over and color with you and your daughter after I record this episode she was like, yeah, so that's what I'm gonna do but do fun things.	
2	Okay. Thank you for everybody who's emails me? We are not alone. You are not alone. Trust me, you are not alone. This shit will get figured out. We are in this together. Kay was the High School Musical song We're All in This to get I'm sorry, I did that to you but we got this we got this and it's going to seem like a lot of times that we don't got it and that's normal and thank you for not killing yourself this week so you can make it to this episode.	
3	I really appreciate and don't kill yourself. It's normal to want to sometimes but if the ideology gets really intense and David Burns has a really great chapter on suicide and this book Feeling Good, please if you can seek medical help immediately.	
2	There's like a a way to assess how serious you are with these thoughts of is there something you're pondering?	
3	I don't think that suicide threats should ever be taken as oh, you're just acting out emotionally. I think they should all be treated as if they're reasonable threat because the thing is when your neurological system I was fucked up and you're not ever never in touch with your feelings and as an adult you feel suicidal that actually makes a lot of sense scientifically that you feel that way but there are ways to stop that. Okay, there are. So please I love you. All next week is going to be a lot lighter have a great day be the change you wish to see in the world say that we should take a day to break away from all the pain.	
1	The brain is made the game is not played alone. And now I will say that we should take a moment and hold it and keep it frozen and know that like as a hopeful undertone and I will say that we should take a day to break away from all the fan of rain has made the game is not played alone and I will say that we should take a moment and hold it and keep it frozen and know that life as	
2	Hopefully I made it this far.	
1	Made it things.
