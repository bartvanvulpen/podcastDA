2	Hello and welcome to the girls room. My name is Marissa.	
1	I'm I guess like the creator of this I don't like that sounds like really official for something that's like not official at all. But anyways, um, yes, I'm Marissa. I'm 22. I don't know what other type of personal information you would like to know or that I should even say but I mean we're going to get real personal with in all these episodes. Anyways, you're going to know all about my vagina my boobs partners that I've had. So like watch out if you've ever been with me because I'm gonna call your ass out. I'm just kidding. We're never going to say names or anything like that. But yeah, this is going to be the first kind of like intro just to explain what this whole podcast is going to be about kind of like a pilot episode. I guess. I mean, no one's probably gonna fucking listen to this anyways, but if you are if you are my one and only fan, this is what you're going to hear in the following episodes. So, um, Yeah, this is called the girls room because my senior year of undergrad. I really realized what I want to do with my life, which was like way late in the game and I couldn't change my degree. So I was really into sex education and I figured since I'm a I was a photography major. That's what I graduated with. I would combine the two together. So I made a photography exhibition that had to do with like sex education body positive. Like the female experience the whole thing and I made a magazine out of it as well. Because when I was younger, I always like super into magazines. Like I had Tiger Beat pop all the other like fucking crazy ones. J17 or J-14, whatever the fuck it was like covering my walls. I was obsessed with them. I was only thing I would do is read these magazines and I never realized how much they fuck me up until I got older like not to say that they're like Naga they're probably better now. I haven't looked at one since I was like 12 well, but I mean it's like so unrealistic. It's all like this airbrushed like beautifully Photoshop like Kirby big boob people like some of that shit just like is not real and like it all really talked about just like boys and fashion, like it never really told us anything like valuable and important. I feel like they had such a platform in so many people reading and stuff and I feel like we could have like talked about like, you know, like I like an article do on Periods are like fucking tampons or pads or just anything like that.	
2	So I decided to create my own and it wasn't so much like sex education because I didn't really talk about sex that much. I talk more about just like vaginas in general no talk of penis. But um, basically I just talked about menstrual products like where you can get them where you can access them the different types of environmentally conscious types like talked about menstrual cups sea sponges, which	
1	Like I never even knew was a thing until I did like research Period Panties stuff like that talked about body hair because that's something that I feel very strongly on because not a lot of people agree with me that I don't shave my legs. I rarely shave my armpits like every once in a blue moon type thing, you know, sometimes I just don't like to so I just don't that was one big thing that I talked about in the magazine and if you do that's totally fine every once in awhile. I love to shave but sometimes I just don't so Talked about waxing laser hair removal environmental friendly ways. Like if you get it's like a certain type of Blade. I don't remember off the top of my head. You can get electric razors, you know whole thing. We talked about all of that good stuff and we talked about a lot of birth control because that's something that not a lot of people have access to which is like pretty fucking crazy. But it's also just like not talked about and explained enough like you don't know like your options and I feel that's something that needs to be Be discussed more. There's so many different options of birth control that I had no idea about literally. I just saw I was like, okay, I could take a pill and like that's it and like use condoms and stuff. I had no fucking idea. There were so many different things. You can get like a bar implanted into your arm.	
2	Like that's crazy. You can get shots and your butt cheeks no idea.	
1	I mean, I think get them in your arms, too. But so there's so many things that I didn't know about because no one ever talks about these things like the sex education that like you get in high school. I don't even think I got one in high school, but I One in middle school and Elementary School in elementary school. They just said basically you're gonna get your period I was like, oh, okay, like what is going to happen? Why is there blood coming out of me? Where the fuck is it coming out of what do I do? How do I catch it? Like am I supposed to put my hands down there and just catch it at all times. Like just nothing was really explained at all. And like that should like traumatizes you when you're younger and you have no idea and then you go home. I remember someone said masturbation. I think they might have said masturbation in That is like sex education course. Honestly, I don't really think so experienced talking about periods and stuff like that, but I went home and I was like Mom what's mashed potatoes? Like they did not tell a shit because if I'm coming home asking about mashed potatoes like that.	
2	That's just not right. So and then I think in seventh grade, they basically just said like girls you're gonna get your period you're gonna get boobs and then boys your voice is going to get all deep your balls are going to drop in like don't have X basically it was just like one of those like I'm in no way shape or form an expert clearly because I don't know jack shit. Like I didn't even know what a penis look like until I saw the movie Hall Pass when I was like maybe I was like 12 or 13. I have no idea and because there was a scene in the hot tub and the guy just like walked out Stark naked and I was like what the fuck is that?	
1	I was like traumatized after that. So I feel like there's just so many things that could be talked about in there's a lot of things like it's embarrassing to talk about I know like when you bleed through your fucking underwear like onto your bed like that's like pretty embarrassing or when you're just like out on the town, you know going crazy and then you just bleed all through your pants. Like there's stuff like that.	
2	Like it's like hard to talk about and it's embarrassing and stuff but there needs to be more talk of these things and like I know like your parents like don't want to talk to you about like having sex and stuff like that like my parents for sure as fuck did not want to do that. Like I think that we had like one conversation like My mom and like never spoke of it again.	
1	So, you know, you might not always have like an older sister or a cousin or a friend just like someone that you can talk to these things about I know it's hard to talk about and it's hard to ask questions on it too because you don't want to just like come out of the blue and be like, what's a dick like, you know, you want to kind of just like he's into it, but it's hard to talk about with people. So I'm hoping that this can just be a way to answer like your questions that you don't even have to ask. I mean you can ask I guess but I just want to lay it out on the table. Well, I want to be as raw and honest as I possibly can like I'm gonna try to edit this as little as possible. I know it's going to be hard because I say like every 14 fucking seconds and I curse again every 14 seconds.	
2	I smack my lips when I talk and just like I swallow it like I just did and that's just like really annoying but I just wanted to be as raw as it can be and I'm going to share the most embarrassing stories. I'll tell you how I shit my pants like I've done it a few times like that's probably not a good thing. You know I talk about shit more than anything else. I talk about yeast infections. Like it's my fucking child, you know, so I just want to let people know that there's other people in the same boat as you and like don't ever be I know it's hard to not be embarrassed but don't be embarrassed. Don't be afraid to talk about these things. Ask questions. I want it to be as open as a platform and like a safe space as possible. So that's just you know, what we're going to do. So every week or I don't even Know how often I'm going to make this because like I said, probably no one's listening. I'm going to have like my one fan and it's probably going to be like my best friend. Like that's it.	
1	So maybe I'll do it like every two weeks once a month once a fucking year.	
2	But yeah, I want it to be a different topic every episode and just like stuff that I feel is really important. So I really want to talk about periods like a lot. I want to talk about being in relationships. And one thing that I think is like really hard to like talk about even like with your Friends and especially with your partner is like pooping and farting in front of your partner. So like that's going to end like that something like, you know, that's like near and dear to my heart because like IBS girls, you know, I'm saying so talking about being ghosted and being the coaster cuz I'm really fucking good at that people go with me all the time. And I also goes people which is like really bad. Yeah. We're going to talk about going through puberty, you know that whole awful time of life, but also like a great experience is going to be just different. Topics all about like the female experience every episode. I'm going to have different guests come on and talk with me share their opinions because I know a lot of times mean other people don't share the same opinion and that is totally fine. And I think that it's so great to get different opinions. And yeah, I just want this to be as accessible as possible and just have like all around just a fun time talking about this. I want them to be like a lot of laughs a lot of good open communication and just a great learning environment. So yeah, I really That people if you're still listening to my annoying as fuck boys, God Bless, but yeah, just stick along with me. We're gonna have a great time. We're gonna talk about sex drugs Rock and Roll Baby. We have so much fucking fun. So yeah, I just keep listening. And yeah, thanks for staying in listen to this for this long. Thank you so much. Okay. See you in the next episode.
