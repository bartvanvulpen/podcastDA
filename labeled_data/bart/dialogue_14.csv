1	Hi, I'm Tony vetto and this is the natural lifestyle is podcast. So way back in December. I had this crazy idea that I was going to run 900 miles from Land's End to John o'groats in 30 days, but not just that I was going to do it Barefoot and yet that would raise socially extreme eyebrows, but it also would raise funds so With that socially extreme I break created a platform gave me an opportunity to raise awareness and funds for environmental Charities and collaborate with leading experts to raise awareness and money for six organizations fighting the top sustainability issues of a bad time. I know of course that running Barefoot would raise those eyebrows. And with those eyebrows, I'll be able to provide a platform a perfect platform to highlight the importance of connecting. We have our environment and those all important key sustainability issues of our time. So I had the pleasure of visiting Surfers against sewerage getting behind the mic with Hugo tag home Hugo is the CEO of surfers again sewage one of the Charities. I have chosen to fundraise for we discuss sustainability and how this small but powerful organization and Making Waves and a becoming a leading voice to help shift legislation. Hugo is an inspirational guy who speaks with passion and integrity and seeks to make this world a cleaner place, so I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did adios. Where did you go you go ready to go with you? Go? Yeah. Thanks man. Thanks coming on board the part of this 3030 challenge if running wasn't enough. It was I wanted to sit down and have conversations with people about sustainability and the great work they're doing because I'm not the expert on might be an expert barefoot running, but I'm certainly not an expert with sustainability. I'm growing. Yeah, you know, I'm I'm probably a class myself. A bit of a hypocrite, you know in recovery now down by where I stand really it's the things have really changed for us and there's so much highlighted for us at this stage.	
3	How have you been how in firstly our we've been here now, so but well first of all, thank you for bringing us into it making us part of the 30 by 30 and we know we're really stoked to have you come by and to be part of your Epic Journey. It's an amazing Endeavor your Taking who are much braver man than I am and probably fit are no doubt too. But but yeah, you know, I've been you know, CSS has been going, you know, almost 30 years now and I've said a first fell in love with the organization back in 1991 the year after it was founded as a young City Surfer an environmentalist, you know, I've always been passionate about the environment and nature generally and you know, I saw this sort of rebellious. Slightly anti-establishment Punky organization that really appealed to me big issue back then was so which hence the name and and that's when I first got involved at a little surf competition up the coast from here in Paul Seth. I met some of the founders and my so the journey began then of course, I went off to University I went went to to do what I did in London in my career and stuff and then ten years ago over 10 years not just over 10 years. And AI I took the Helm of the organization at that stage. It should have gone to a Heyday it had some brilliant people involved some amazing campaigners and Brilliant leaders and achieved a lot but it sort of lost its way wasn't quite sure what it wanted to do. The the initial campaign had sort of been very successful and it needed to develop and expand and change and that's what I came in to do and I came in and this whole place Des this office was a bit of a squat it was a bit.	
1	Is the second space right? You were somewhere else?	
3	It was in another office Round the Corner because you know in the early days and their couple of spaces before that, but this has been the sort of longest home of SAS. And this is a spiritual homeland of it. So poor tauern Saint Agnes, you know, these beaches are the the Homeland that the place where it was born. And and so I took over and it was sort of a physical and metaphorical squat. It was sort of a crazy ramshackle place where your kitty where we are now there weren't many people about I've come from working in central London and came in here and it was in a really bad sort of State there were very few of us then but I thought that there was a lot of Hope to create change and a new wave of success for the organization and we've developed the team new way. Yeah, you know we've developed, you know into one of now the country's leading sort of environmental marine conservation Charities campaigning Charities and it's a small operation.	
1	Yeah, you know not like it. I mean, I know it's so interesting and Team come out to meet me. No, yeah, and you realize it when you such a big impact on making at the moment, it's a small organization it just yeah, great decision itself, isn't it?	
3	I think yeah, there's a message on that. I mean, sometimes I question the sustainability of that because of course it was a lot of pressure on people at time but but small is good. And I think people like small particular in the charity sector, I think you know those, you know, the age of the really giant Charities when it becomes really a big Marketing and fundraising machine quite often. I think, you know people aren't so warm to that. I think we're a really accessible charity. We create a lot of opportunities for people people come and volunteer. They can campaign with us. They can have their voice heard in Parliament. They can campaign on Plastics on climate on water quality on Marine protected areas with us. They can do all sorts of things there really is relevant to what they love most which is their local Beach or their local scripture water where they serve where they swim where they run up where they walk their dog whatever they do on that. So, Piece of Coastline and so we're really about I suppose the way I look at it where a positive pyramid scheme. So we're very small executive. Yeah, you know, we're 20 whatever 25 people here. We have a hundred and eighty Regional reps around the country. We mobilize about a hundred thousand volunteers every year we take all of those people's voices to Parliament with us to our ocean conservation all party parliamentary group where we you know, we call for change where we try and create new legislation where we push for new legislation. And alongside other brilliant Charities, the green pieces of friends of the Earth the marine conservation society's lots of great people working in this space and that's really the model, you know, we activate and Empower people to sort of get involved in protecting what they love and we amplify their voice to call on the powers that be whether that's business or whether that's you know politicians to create change. We've been successful in lots of areas on Plastics on water quality, you know, we'd be part of the climate debate. So it's you know, it's a A good place always to the growing in our understanding of what we need to do and where we need to sort of get to although, you know, it's a bit of a weird. There's never a sort of a plateau of achievement. I remember when I started I thought well when we get to x amount of money per year turnover that will be perfect will stop there but just doesn't work like that.	
1	We were only at the long game on you. Yeah, you know, we're starting to see so much change coming through anyway, so the message started off with sewage, right? Yeah one understands that was back in that was 1990.	
3	1990 May 1990 May the 10th 1990s.	
1	Yeah, because that's incredible Silas explains the guys downstairs that I pretty much came the I'd say from I'm so from the age of four up until I think 16 every year so we did our holidays in Cornwall. Yeah, and I never thought about that. Yeah sewage in the sea. Yeah, you know, but that's I mean it's terrible and what I read that they want in the guys that it was between it was poop between skin and board.	
3	Yeah, you know, well, I'm not on the west days it absolutely Be like that, you know and I you know, I you know, I surfed in the area during those times and you know, sometimes I saw pollution sometimes I didn't you know, we've still got water quality issues. Now, we've just had damning report from the the EAA about the performance of water company. So I've had a lot of success we've seen a great cleanup of our Coastline, but we're almost we've peaked past the top of the bell curve now. Okay thing back down I really and so we're seeing I'm Paula Akana said drop the ball where it's nice to each getting back into the sea and also that creates The Perfect Storm with more people in the sea now. So back in 1991. We started surfing truly still was a niche sport. It was far out. It was for a few Hardy individual as man, you know, maybe or maybe even two weeks in the summer, you know kids would come down and get a polystyrene born. It was really like a subculture. You know now it's not a subculture. We've got, you know, the High Street using surfing all the time to sell more products we've More and more people surfing year-round amazing wetsuits means they can surf equally as well in January as in June. So the whole thing is exploded and in a way that explosion in the actual the market and the the, you know, the sport of Surfing means that more people are now putting themselves in the firing line of potential pollution, whether that's you know, toxic chemicals in the sewage in the see plastic pollution are called lines, which is everywhere, but that's what I love about this message because you don't you don't think about that.	
1	I mean, I've come on stag parties and God knows what Else that I've been surfing orientated, but no one's ever been. Okay, what's the quality of the water that we ghostly immersed in right now?	
3	Yeah, it's a super important thing. You know, this is a I mean, you know sadly speaking and I think we can see the dramatic, you know, of course the dramatic evidence now of climate change and the gases where all the impact of gases were putting into the into the atmosphere, but let's not forget that you know that we are, you know putting equal. Have crazy chemicals into our into our ocean and waterways and pathogens and fertilizers and things that you know, even the runoff from their farm lands, right, you know, which is really creating dead zones in the sea, which is putting chemicals into our environment that you know, people are coming into contact with in the ocean antibiotics and bacteria that now become resistance to those. So there's a lot of you know, there's a lot of issues and the ocean really is you know, is the life support system of us all, you know as much as the a Amazon rainforest, I know because we talk about the lungs of the planet. Yeah, but you know the, you know the ocean creates every second breath that we breathing a half of the oxygen that we take in and of course it provides protein for much of the planet, you know, whether you know listeners, you know, eat eat fish or not that is and it's a fact and you know, it's a really important part of the planet and of course, it's the majority of the Banning indeed. We should be called Planet ocean really not planet Earth was over 70 percent water. Yeah, so, you know, it's	
1	Last night Goblin it's also you know this really emotive environment, you know, people have this connection with the see it brings out this sort of visceral deep-seated sort of feeling of you know, some very interesting though because we aren't you know, what we will be introducing people back into nature and water is a big part of that, you know take me into the ponds in Hampstead or get them into cold water immersion. And we do Beach and eats and stuff like that would get them out in the sea, but if you really think about it, you know that there is a deep deep connection to Water, isn't that why you don't see people at the beach turning around and looking at the Woodland and then they were looking out see are absolutely absurd deep connections a really deep connection.	
3	And you know, I think that's you know, what, you know, we sort of want to be the most authentic voice of the the ocean in the so charity sector, you know, really represent people who live and breathe the ocean really wanna, you know, get involved in protecting it I think we've done a sort of a good job on that. You know, where is he said was sort of small team here, but we Empower a lot of people and I think that model is attractive too. Policymakers to Business Leaders because authenticity is a really really important part of our narrative and creating change. I think in this world is full of fakes. I think SAS can stand up as a really authentic charity that truly is connected to the ocean. You know, we look at the ocean out of those windows over there in the office and that and that is a really big point of difference to other Charities that might lose that really tactile direct connection with the thing. They're trying to protect or that issues. They're working on.	
1	People can sniff that out currently you can recognize immediately whether it's authentic or not. Whether people are living it being it, you know, yeah don't solicit ideas one, isn't it? So you guys so we go from sewerage to now marine conservation.	
3	Yeah looking at Plastics or Plastics is the collective. I mean, it's huge right now, right? It's like life and we've got this, you know, we back in sort of 2016. We realized you know that you know what we've been working on Plastics. You know plastic pollution for a long while in some ways. We haven't really named, you know named it. We hadn't really uniform the cohesive campaign around it. And so we launched our plastic free communities campaign. We started much more active campaigning on pushing for legislation around plastic bags around plastic bottles around all of those things to create, you know, as it were tap, you know that's access charges and and better ways to create circular economy. And also looking looking at bands are bands on straws.	
1	Steroids and those sorts of things and resurface again soon as you you behind the legislation that led to the charges on plastic.	
3	They absolutely yeah, so we don't want to the Charities that all the Coalition a lot, you know, we work with four or five big Charities on that and of course, you know everyone at the time thought, you know, five pence what you know, what's that going to do to pass dickbag circulation, but indeed it reduced it by over 80% million fewer bags in the environment.	
1	That's so good to hear me because I was one of those those voices us. You know, where's where does that 5p go? What impact it's going to have people are still going to do the same thing and I think as as That small change over time though. And because we've become more aware of plastic. Yeah, I guess that's just going to grow and grow and grow more isn't it? Because we never take plastic bag shopping and yeah, just not you know, it started off with used to take the plastic bags. We have to go shopping now.	
3	It's like okay we have cloth bags that we don't you know, what it's sort of interesting is that I mean, I think there's a lot of spillover effect you so these things become inspirational to people, you know things that we accepted, you know, perhaps back in the day. As the right thing to do, you know, we now look at as the wrong things. I mean, let's look at let's look at a controversial sort of marine marine conservation topic that you know, lots of people sort of feel very passionate about which is Wailing, you know, you know, however long ago, you know, a hundred and fifty years ago, whatever it was everyone used well products and it was just an accepted thing. It was like this is the norm is what we're going to do. Well, I'll Street lamps with it will put it in product will eat it will do whatever. Of course now Society doesn't was completely wrong. You shouldn't happen our course. There are certain countries that still stylizing. However, it was completely part of society and the moment the normal thing is is oil. Everything we do is is viewed by all or made from oil. That's normal. I mean in 50 years in a hundred years will we look back the same way that we were complaining now? I got on my God petrol stations and oh my God, you know, you know, you know things made of This material that was buried in the ground, you know Millennia ago, and there's nothing on becoming a parent to highlight.	
1	No, actually, I'm looking forward to the conversation whom especially my youngest you know, you want anyone coming. Yeah world. That would be a three year old and a one year old in so many years having that conversation. Yeah. There's that Peter Collins term of environmental generation Amnesia. Yeah, you know, it's every every year even that were born into the change that surround you know, yeah, and there's a new exception.	
3	Via Baseline exactly what I mean, that's what it comes to what's Now lies Drive, which is you know, it's gonna terrify me. You know, there was a lot of Doom and Gloom out there wasn't really pretty shocking, you know evidence now, of course on climate change, you know, we really are in a looking, you know, the, you know, the evidence that say a sort of climates and the collapse, you know, if we're not very very careful now as a as a as a species on the planet, you know, we're looking at you know, You know only a very small amount of actual nature surviving and thriving I mean and then what is the statistic that you know out of you know out of all of the out of all of the animals on the planet, you know, there's only like 10% they're actually wild animals and I just simply the 60% and Wildlife being wiped out the last 50 years.	
1	That's half the human life if you if you go by the blue zones 100 years.	
3	Oh, yeah, so it's sort of terrifying stuff, but that said, I think we need to look. Look at the politics of Hope as well. Actually, what what can we I mean are still there is still a lot of arrests in a lot of ocean out there. There are still a lot of nature out there that we can protect and we need to reward and protect these spaces could he not just not just but you know lines on a map that says zoned off as a marine protected area or a protect their on, you know on land but actually fully protected. So people can't take anything out of them people can't you know extract you know, whether it's you know oil. Or or nature from those zones because actually, you know nature does have a great capacity to regenerate and thriving absolute and the marine conservation zones that have been successful show that and the ocean can bounce back. We need to let it bounce back and we need to give it space to breathe hold sway, right? Let's give space. Yeah, totally. So, you know, we need to look at I mean ultimately it will come down to what you know what how much basically we really need to re wild and and instead of save and how much can that then keep, you know population functioning properly on the planet as the populations growing.	
1	Yeah, but even if we go back to this side out in 1992 where we are now, so you have a population growth in that period of time but you'll recognize and bottom will people in the city of drawers. Yeah, you know, but I think the positives of you so many huge positive service if you look at hand when this started in 1992, where is now You know what kind of house the house that work the same as well as cleanouts what we're seeing the difference in what I mean? I think Shannon's from 1990 to where they are. Now.	
3	What is it depends on the metrics will really look at that. If we look at it on a very sort of as it were the most basic level, you know, the campaigns that we you know ran on water quality help create a really big shift an improvement in water quality in the UK. So we went from what would have been is 27 percent of UK beaches passing the minimum European standards. 1992 now, you know above in a 95% typically every year that's really good. Those those standards also masks a few, you know, they're reported in a way. There's some testing that it can be flawed those sorts of things and they don't necessarily tell the full picture but on a basic level that's a really good success story. That's amazing and that really came about very strong legislation. It wasn't just business going on. We shouldn't be putting sewage in the see anymore. What happened was is some people who were much cleverer than I am rope the new legislation in Brussels, then got put into UK law that said the water companies have to make this investment by these days and that's what happened and that says were part of that Journey, you know, we weren't the only part of that Journey but we're part of that journey and so it shows what good legislation can do because you know, sadly speaking unless whistle of often unless we really forced to do things through legislation. We won't do them, you know, the companies will Way to avoid it if they possibly can particularly if it costs them money. Yeah, mainly if it costs that much because they're not looking at the bigger picture.	
1	Unfortunately. Are they not just that small?	
3	That's exactly that growth or really they're looking at paying their shareholders exactly the shells the wrong end of growth, isn't it? Yeah, and and it's sad because you know what we can't you know, what we need to grow is is nature around us and truly grow it not not youth some some, you know, sort of as it were councils death. Energy that says a growing nature without actually growing in you know by putting up a few. You know, I know a couple of B boxes pseudo and they build when they build a new housing estate and what we really need to really grow nature and find out you know, where we're going to really really protect for the future and that's what's going to keep our kids, you know driving on the planet by actually having the trees and the clean Ocean and the clean streams and rivers and grasslands and all of the Flora and Fauna that go with that you actually Because a system because all of those things function together, you know, I'm you know, I'm not a scientist but it's well worth it. And this is a an ecosystem that that works together, you know, all of these things. We need to protect the codependent. We don't just need to protect the elephants or the Rhinos or the B's, you know, there's lots of things about big-scale protection and nature what we need to do.	
1	Yeah, and it starts to me. I always think it's about reconnecting humans to that then we Can fall in the fall back in love with it? Yep, then we can understand the system and eventually understand how we are that system. Yes the point right? Absolutely. No, absolutely your mental health issues and everything else with placing. It's the pure disconnect. I see it from nature whether nature deficit disorder mouthing.	
3	Well, we don't I mean, you know, I only see it through the prism of friends and family, but you know, there's no doubt a mental health crisis, you know other professionals I talk to I talk about the crisis within their workforces of how many people are still suffering. And you know, I think we're in a perfect storm. I think people are hooked to their screens. I think they're constantly connected, you know, rather than liberating people from their workplace, you know, the technology is simply anchor them into their workplace so you can never ever escaped and you can never feel that you're truly through the free and then we're in a very comparative competitive Society, you know in social media, you know every Every platform is gear there to be competitive and to make you want to compete that's that's the way they get you to do more with that by going right get these people are doing this. So you've got to do a bit more.	
1	Absolutely. I do feel that as can. I have the battle with it by I still see there's the huge positives of it, right? Absolutely so we could connect right? I could I found completely a service again serious. Then I found you know, my interviews all the way along. It's all being organized all through social media. Yeah, and then there's stuff that we can be putting out. I guess it has to have that positive length. What it is we're putting out again. Yeah into the world. Yep, you know for people to again and they can reconnect and reward through that we seems nice using technology to reconnect and reward but it can't you know, it's got to be it's got to be possible if the sort of you know, it's sort of paradoxical isn't it Resolute and I agree with you, but you know, I'd look at it.	
3	You know, I'm a maybe it's you know, it's a it's a bad example, you know that the foods that people shouldn't eat too much of that delicious and Brilliant and and can be good in you know, the right sort of those has you know, and I think the same applies to social media. I mean people are just too hooked on it and it's you know, it's you know, it's a it's a really, you know, sort of addictive space and sort of compulsive space and I think it Makes people also sadly very unhappy quite often because they look at things and you know realized that it's very it's a very curated space. Generally. It's not it's not sort of warts and all within social media. Generally. It's curated and we all you know curate now can cure a little sort of PR that have World a message of what we want our answer see ya, you know and here and so that tends to make people other people feel bad because I think people are constantly doing something sort of amazing or they might be constantly, you know constantly looking Rate or feeling gray or never got any problems. And actually it's a fake because we've all got those things and we've all got issues and problems and dilemmas and days. We feel bad and days. We don't perform well and days we don't do anything interesting days with sat on our sofa long and it will 10 miles today.	
1	Yeah my Purgatory. Yeah in that space exactly. We need to blog more about that.	
3	Yeah. Well, you know, you know, it's that and you're doing an incredible Challenge and I think it's great for people tear and I think you know to push, you know, Put into a space where they I think people should go understand Challenge and success in their own context not compared to other people, you know for me, you know running 10K and then swimming a case. Like that's a big sport. That's a big support for me. You know, I couldn't, you know, I couldn't do I couldn't do the back-to-back runs you're doing Barefoot across the country, but that's my own sort of that's my own my own accomplishment and I base that on on what makes me feel sort of good and I know how to To achieve that you know, I sometimes look at it with surfing because certain things are very very Macho Sport and it can be pretty like wearing how much milk is Mo and actually sexism there often is within surfing. Yeah, and and actually I look at it. Well, you know, there's guys like surfing, you know, 30-foot waves and I'm never going to surf a 30-foot wave. I'm not going to suffer 13-foot way. If you know, my comfort zone is probably up to about you know, six for you know on a good day and that's where I like to serve but does that make My experience any less valid than the person who surfing the 30-foot wave or no because that's that's what I want to do. That's what makes me feel good. That's that's the space.	
1	I want to operate in absolutely and I relate this to doing ice baths. Yeah, so getting in a nice but I always say there's a PB but it's not personal best even it's just it's being present. Yes your profound best in that moment. Some days I get in there. It might be three minutes other days I get in there. It's 10 minutes. Yep, but then there's other stuff. That's And before the three minutes and on the stuff that's happened with all the ten minutes. They're always just profound best. They're always just present best.	
3	You know, I like that because you know that there's so many variables that around any day that you're performing an anything when we salute with your family as a dad as a brother as a kid, whatever you're doing and and you can't always Factor all of those things in know so it's hard. Yeah, but but yeah, I think you know, you know fundamentally, you know, I suppose we you know, we talked about nature death. Disorder and I think that we know the benefits is not going in the water are going out into nature. And that's one of the things we're really striving to sort of keep with, you know, this organization. It truly is about that that powerful connection, you know, inspiring and motivating. That's what lots of our members are rep sort of share, you know, they're not all surface and you know surfing isn't a prerequisite in our in our sort of organization is finally out and you've recommitted to the surf people people talk about it. I mean, I I sort of look at it. It I often use the analogy of the Carphone Warehouse, you know, no one wants to carve out anymore. And for a mobile phone. You probably don't want to shop in a in a warehouse in up for other things you do, but for a mobile phone you don't and it's sort of it's sort of strange with it with with the same. You know, we're no Lawton would not all about surfers are not just about some expensive about what people are against were what people have for, you know, we want to know what people are for protecting the ocean taking action on climate change, you know, reducing their plastic impact all of those things, you know, And it's about really positive movement of bringing people together and that movement of volunteering whether it's Beach cleans plastic free communities Regional rare. This campaign is on the ground all of that voice connects in to try and push for change. It's not about each individual action. It's good. Yeah, we're never going to solve the world just through voluntary measures of individual action that's going to be a hardcore people but that hardcore of people can actually push on the powers that be to say, we need change. We need bombs on straws and stirrers like we've got We need the plastic bag charge. We need more action on sewage. We need more action on climate and those people can carry on your knighting until the legislators legislate to protect the planet in the way it needs to be protected. And that's really the goal the campaign aims right up there in Parliament or in the you know, European Parliament or you know, globally for all campaign has to push their governments to actually create the systems that we can live in much more sustainably is an ester system. We're living in a sustainable like we're all just trapped. We're all just part of it so Economic system, we're all trapped in it in some way the plastic system. We're trapped in the carbon system. We're trapped it and it's up to actually legislators to help us get out of that individual it very hard. We can shift things around. Are you can do your basic needs to change up a little.	
1	Yeah. Absolutely exactly. How can I help you?	
3	How can people get involved people can get involved every day by making choices around Plastics? Yeah, what they refuse, you know, they're reusable cup there there, you know bamboo toothbrush, whatever they choose. To do refusing bags, whatever it might be taking their refillable water bottle with them people can join as a member people who come to a beach clean pick up some plastic with us help recycle some plastic. They can help us Monitor and record stuff through citizen science so we can present evidence to government and Industry. They can download the safer see service to get real-time water quality information at their favorite Beach over 350 around the country. So all sorts of things that they can get involved with. So yeah, we're there online SAS dot org dot U k-- for a little be involved with	
1	That's what we need. Now. I like that. So you responsible for the little plaques at the beaches because we visited Constantine Bird. Yeah, and they've got a little litter picking plaque there.	
3	Now those boards that I think you're talking about the two-minute Beach clean. Yes, another organization. They're doing great thing right now though, isn't it? It is a really good model is just a reminder.	
1	When you come in either first thing you see when you go into Constantine, you can't park little kiosk to buy a tea and then bam you're hit with that.	
3	It's a really lovely initiative a really great organization. On and the year we've done Lots with them in the past and every piece of plastic that we pick up from each every piece that we remove is a real Victory. I think the key as I say within all of these groups is not to to assign the blame to the individual know so the the whole literature, I mean sort of littering per se no back in I think it was the 50s keep America beautiful brought together an ad campaign with burst and marsteller. To actually to make plastic pollution and packaging pollution a thing that was the responsibility of individuals by saying pollution starts with the individual and it ends with the individual and actually that's actually something we really can test. So the sort of littering sort of construct is something I understand. There are literature's out there. But actually the responsibility for that is with industry and government has a higher right sister comes from that sit to help us live the way we need to do because ultimately if we focus too much on littering per se within that agenda what happens Is is that the corporate go? Well, that's great. Let's just keep pushing it pushing it to the end of pipe solution where pandas are sponsibility and that's it. When really what they need to do is create much more closed loop recycling systems. They need to eliminate as much of their packaging as possible reduce the amount change their packaging materials, wherever possible and make sure that they give to the consumer and much more sustainable option because if not, we're just going to be endlessly picking up more and more staff and ultimately that either gets incinerated or buried in the ground and some of it will get rid. Cycle which isn't really efficient the best way to do it is deal with it through design and manufacture not through picking it up.	
1	Yeah, it definitely needs to change of that level.	
3	But at the same time we're really willing to carry on picking up. We mobilize a hundred thousand brilliant volunteers. They pick up plastic from the beach. They monitor what Plastics were finding their held the big Brands to account for the Plastics are putting into our system and that's why they're so important. It brings the community together to say not that we're going to clean up forever. But say we've had enough and we need change to happen and how can the	
1	And the collective move towards changing legislation.	
3	So, you know, what we do is, you know, we will bring together. So for example, we did the biggest brand audit in the UK of Browns. We're finding at the beach no surprises for the top ten, you know, Coca-Cola's Pepsi-Cola has you know McDonald's those sorts of big Brands and we did a you know, huge survey with our volunteers that data then fed into the government's consultation on extended producer responsibility to hold. The the companies through account with the polluter pays principle if that inter-government consultations on deposit return systems, so you can see that actually that piece of trash that you pick up from the beach that piece of plastic pollution actually can then influence the powers that be to create change and that's what that's what were there to do. That's what were there to do. I like that. So yeah, so that's good. And you know, I just want I know I want to make sure that the beaches that we have around here the beautiful beaches parent Port Saint Agnes Chapel. I poured all of the beaches around corner in the country and around the world can be protected for you know, for future Generations. The beaches as Jack Cousteau said the great unifier of people it's a place that you know, your sort of, you know, stripped of sort of everything really see, you know, your sort of all equal on the beach and in the ocean and so and so it's an amazing place that sort of takes away this sort of hierarchical this this this this very competitive society and just brings people together. So it's a really really Beneficial positive space, you know healthy Active Space for young people and for the future, hopefully, let's try and keep him that way. Absolutely. I mean, it's a good place to finish man. Yeah, I like that good to what thank you very much. It's a pleasure to talk to you. It's been beautiful.
