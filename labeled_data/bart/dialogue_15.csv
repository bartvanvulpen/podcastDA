4	Hey, hey, thanks for tuning into marshmallows. Hope hold on pain ends podcast Channel. My name is Laura and I am going to be your host.	
2	I'm taking a leap of faith today and starting this podcast because my hope is that for those of you who are struggling out there. Maybe you can find some hope and encouragement. We live in a world today that focuses on negativity and as humans. Can we just go about suffering through life and we tend to lose Hope and Faith, but I'm here to tell you that I am a testament of God's grace and if you just hold on that pain that you're currently feeling will and so a little bit of background on myself. I'm 36 years old and a mother to three feet beautiful humans, I grew up with my aunt and uncle and sunny, Florida and when I was 28 years old. I packed all of my things into a tiny U-Haul and I decided that I was going to move with my kids to Illinois and at the time my two children were eight and six so I decided to leave Florida because I was stuck in this vicious cycle of a domestic violence relationship and after years of making excuses of why I needed to stay I realized that I never ever wanted my babies to grow up and think that it was okay to be mistreated or two to mistreat others.	
4	So I felt that I needed to set the example for them and that it was okay to leave.	
2	So three months after my divorce now, I'm living in Illinois and sadly I found myself in the same exact situation except this time. It was with a different guy, so I ended up getting Pregnant with my youngest son and luckily this time. It only took me a year of this toxic relationship to be in the same vicious cycle to finally say enough is enough. Maybe it was just the familiarity that drove me to someone as toxic as the first guy, but luckily this time again, you know, I Found the courage to break that cycle. For good. So at this point in my life, I was terrified of relationships and terrified of raising three kids on my own and I never ever pictured myself being a single parent. So, you know, it's just just in that era of my life alone. I remember just living in fear constantly, so during the turmoil and chaos. Of this roller coaster that I called life on top of all of that. I found out that my daughter who at the time was 8 years old had endured the most traumatic experience any child should ever have to endure I found out that she was sexually abused by her father.	
4	So when you know finding this out, I immediately put the kids in counseling.	
2	I wanted to get us all help but I remember feeling guilt beyond belief at that time in my life. I thought that that was the hardest thing that I would ever have to face and it was just I allowed the guilt to consume me, you know, how could I not have seen? How could this happen? How could the guy that was supposed to be the one to protect my children with me was the one that had harmed my kids the most I mean, it was just awful and I felt like a terrible mother it took years of counseling for me to finally overcome those feelings and I really struggled with that for a long time so fast forwarding now a few years at this point in my life.	
4	Life I Lived a pretty peaceful life or at least the most normal peaceful kind of Life per se to me right?	
2	I finally had a stable home for my kids and I I had a stable job my kids had overcome trauma and all seem to finally be falling into place and at this time of my life. I ended up meeting a guy who came into my life. And never did I ever imagine the day that I met him how important he would become to me.	
4	So I was terrified of relationships when we first met and so when I remember hanging out with him and telling him that I never want to you know, I didn't want a relationship.	
2	I didn't want to be the rebound for him and I just didn't want a relationship but in all reality it was just because I was terrified that I was going to fall into this. Is horrible cycle again? And you know, it didn't really take me long to realize that he was not like my track record of guys it was funny because the first conversation that I ever had with him was about God and so in my opinion that should have been like a big clue that he was different. Right, but the other thing that like really stuck to me is when I would mention to him that I was going to go hang out with my girlfriends or go out, you know to a bar or whatever.	
4	He was the type of person to not blow up my phone.	
2	He wouldn't you know, text me asking me where I was or who I was with and at the very beginning I remember feeling like, you know, what the heck like does this guy not care about me, but in all reality.	
4	Ality, he was the first person in my life to actually show me that this is what normal relationships are supposed to look like.	
2	He was the first person in my life who wasn't controlling who wasn't trying to control every aspect of my life. He didn't want to know where I was at or what I was doing because there was trust in the relationship. How about that?	
4	So, you know, like what I can be Dependent and I can have time for myself without unrealistic accusations, you know, it was just not normal for me at the beginning but I'm really grateful because he truly taught me what a normal relationship is supposed to look like we didn't have any drama with us. He too was a single dad of three kids.	
2	And so we understood each other that the kid, you know. My kids would come first for me and his kids would come first for him. And then so slowly we started bringing the kids around and you know, eventually he slowly started stepping into that fatherly figure role that my children didn't have four years.	
4	So he was pretty much my rock and most importantly he was my cheerleader.	
2	I mean this man has supported me and all of my crazy ideas through thick and thin, you know, he supports my decisions.	
4	He supports my ideas.	
2	He supports my thoughts. He's just truly my best friend and he has taught me so much about myself that I never I never knew, you know, I guess I think our whole relationship. Bishop has been a shock to me because you know, this is what normal feels like this is what normal is supposed to be. So we slowly became a very close-knit blended family our kids, you know, genuinely love and care about each other and at one point our daughters were really really close but you know, how teen girls are as they get older. They have different interest.	
4	And so they kind of grew apart. They still loved each other as sisters, but you know, it was it was just different so his daughter and my middle child Zachary as the kids got older and they went into their teen years.	
2	They just became really tight.	
4	You know, they were really close and always good in our world to be honest.	
2	We had like really adapted very well to this Blended lifestyle and this little blended family that that we had and we never you know, we didn't really live together, but we did everything together and so they became our family, but you know in 2018.	
4	Our world as we knew it would come crashing down on us and so I was at my highest at that point in my life.	
2	I had a great relationship. I had finally landed a career worth, you know retiring from or so, I thought and I was finally going to take a leap of faith and by my own home and so I was living the American dream the job I had It was pretty cushy government job with great pay but it did have a stipulation that in order to work there.	
4	I had to live within the municipal boundaries of that City.	
2	So I ended up finding a five acre farm that you know, it was always my dream to have and we had a horse my kids and I had a horse and we always boarded him and then so I thought okay if I have to To move again. This is going to be a you know, I'm going to buy my dream home and I want my horse to be right in my backyard, but never in a million years that I actually think that a I would get approved for, you know a bank loan for this place and be that I would actually get this place.	
4	So on September 16th 2018. I got the phone call.	
2	A lifetime they had accepted the offer on this farm and you know, we could move forward with the purchase of this home.	
4	And so I was living the American dream, but in a matter of 40 minutes literally after getting the best phone call if my life.	
2	I actually got the worst phone call with my life.	
4	My three children were home alone while I was at the new house and my daughter was frantic on the other end of the phone and her and my youngest son had found my 14 year old son dead.	
2	My son Zachary had taken his own life by Suicide and so my life as I knew it in that moment.	
4	And in that phone call just ended.	
2	there were absolutely no words or there are absolutely no words that I can use to describe to you the agonizing pain that I felt literally it was as if my world just stood still minutes felt like hours and it was just horrifying they say that when a That loses a child it is as if part of that parent Soul dies with them and I wholeheartedly believe that the person that I was before my son Zachary died just no longer existed. And so the pain that I felt, you know the weight that I carried it was beyond overwhelming to me to say the least so my heart was	
4	A shattered and it's you know, there was this physical pain like literally it just it felt as if somebody was physically squeezing my heart with like their bare hands. I mean it was just unbearable. I started suffering from severe panic attacks and you know somehow I knew that I needed to find the strength to be supportive of my two surviving children.	
2	As They too had suffered unbearable trauma through this, you know, we had been faced with with difficult times before in our lives and we had you know trauma that we live through but there was nothing in this world that compared to this.	
4	So it was a nightmare that I just wanted to wake up from but I couldn't you know, and on top of losing my child.	
2	I felt horrible for my daughter because her I had to call her abuser which is their father and I had to tell him that our son had just died by Suicide and it was the absolute worst phone call that I ever had to make in my life and not to mention that now this man who my daughter had not seen. In eight years was going to end up coming up from Florida to our son's funeral and so my heart literally hurt from my children and from her perspective. Like I could never even imagine how she felt you know, she found her brother dead. She suffered through the shock and the trauma and you know after eight years here, she was standing in front of the man who had sexually abused her for years. And so as a mother, I can't even begin to describe to the guilt that I felt the pain that I felt it just I felt like a failure. I had failed both my son Zachary who was lying in a casket in front of me, and now I had failed her, you know, because I couldn't protect her way back when so just the agonizing pain.	
4	In that came from this it was truly unbearable. So on top of all of this I ended up we ended up moving to the farm, but shortly after I moved into the farm with the kids.	
2	I ended up losing the job that I once thought I would retire from so I now had to learn to live with Pete. PTSD depression anxiety and to top it all off the stress of you know, the insecurity of not having a job. Now. How was I going to provide for my kids and you know life was just crumbling before me like before my own eyes. It was just like You know, how much more could I possibly take?	
4	Well, it didn't get better it actually got worse.	
2	So my really extremely supportive boyfriend who was my rock and the only person that you know, I could rely on really in the state of Illinois that was right there for me through thick and thin now we broke up and just it was just too much literally like everything was just too much and so in the interim of all of this, I was trying to find answers as to why my beautiful son, you know, my happy boy had decided to take his own life and I was going through his social media trying to look for answers and I decided to keep his Snapchat open as a Channel of communication for his friends to reach out to me because on top of me morning for my child and me having to watch my children mourn their sibling. I also felt really guilty that his friends to had to mourn him and all of this stress and all of this pain just turned into self-hatred. Like how did I get here? You know there. There was a kid through social media who like literally reached out to me and said, you know your son's and he'll write and I'll just never forget that message because it really made my mental state worse than I already was and it was no fault of this kid to think that way. She was just going by what she knew. You know what she was taught. I mean suicide, you know a lot of People have the misconception that that's just the ultimate unforgivable sin. And so I really struggled with that. And in the meantime, I had experienced a couple of Supernatural things, you know, involving Zachary and one of them was in a dream he had came to me and had told me that you know, my land was going to be And there were a couple of other things while I was wide awake that happened but you know, I won't go into detail there really personal but I can tell you that through those things it was as if I was being assured that my son was, you know at peace and that he was in heaven.	
4	So as I try to cope with all	
2	of this and this was just literally all in a matter of a couple of months my farm the farm that I had bought it. So it literally had over 1500 Christmas trees on it and the guy that used to own it before me he ran like a, you know, a private you cut Christmas tree farm for about 30 years and so to get me through the holidays. I decided that I would continue to run this you cut tree farm knowing nothing about it, but it was mainly really to keep myself occupied keep my mind occupied and and get myself and my children through the holiday season without sack. So, you know, we had moved in on a Monday, which was the Monday before Thanksgiving and then that Friday we were literally selling. Christmas trees and it was it was just crazy. But after the Christmas season had passed, you know, I was no longer busy and I was falling into a really deep depression. And then so I started making myself get up and get out of bed. I would take my kids to school in the morning drop them off and for a few weeks. I remember just laying in bed doing nothing except for wallowing in my own self-pity. And so Finally I decided okay no more. I need to find something to do and so one of the buildings on my farm it used to be what the previous owner called to shop and I know he's to build himself like small airplanes in there.	
4	And so it was kind of like if you can picture it was it was a hanger but it was like a like just like a mechanic shop. It had shelves everywhere, you know grease everywhere holes and	
2	So anyhow with the help of friends, I started rehabbing this building and keeping myself again busy consuming myself in something, right. So so that I didn't have to focus on my pain and I started coming up with the idea of turning this place into an event venue. I wanted, you know to share my farm with other people may be in similar situations or Yo this place if I can describe it in one word, it's healing I have found so much healing in this in the Serene place of mine and and I'm just so blessed for that. But anyhow, I want I want to share that with others and so my now ex-boyfriend would actually come over at night and for like a month straight. He just worked really hard to help me. patch holes and repaint this whole entire building and eventually I went out and I got my business license and I decided to go ahead and open this building up for you know for the public to rent out for for events parties birthday parties live celebrations that type of thing so,	
4	At this point, you know before I knew it so my son had passed away in September. I moved into the farm in November.	
2	We got through the holidays and now it was Easter and Easter Sunday was coming. I was extremely sad because I wouldn't be spending it with my little blended family as I had been doing for the past, you know five years. Years, and so I don't honestly even remember why but my own kids weren't even with me on Easter. And so I remember being there all alone and it was at one of the lowest and darkest points in my life. And I remember calling my now ex-boyfriend and telling him.	
4	You know, what I'm going to go to church for Easter Sunday if you want to go, you know, I'll meet you there, whatever and And now to give you a little bit of history on our religious background, we both grew up Catholic and we both believed in God and you know, neither one of us was super religious.	
2	Like we just we believed I was the type of person that would pray at night. You know, we just I mean, we weren't we were definitely like not the church-going type of people and we both kind of Like a sour taste in our mouth when it came to religion because of the Catholic religion, which I'm not doubting anybody. That's Catholic at all. My family, they're all very devout Catholics. And so, you know, they just they just I believe they're teaching teaches us to kind of fear. God verses that he is a loving God.	
4	So anyhow, I ended up going to this church.	
2	I showed up for that Easter Sunday, sir.	
4	Service and I walk in and there was my ex-boyfriend with his daughter and I remember sitting in the service listening to what the pastor had to say. And I remember really feeling broken and and just praying for Zach praying for his axle.	
2	I remember you know that girl telling me that my son was in Hell repeating in my head and	
4	So, you know, I felt a little bit better once I left that Sunday, but I still was very much broken. And so the following Sunday came around and again, I text my ex-boyfriend and told him. Hey, I'm going to go to church, excuse me. And so when the next Sunday came around he sat next to me and again, I don't remember much but Was a different pastor and he really got my attention and and he said something that it was just kind of like an eye-opener for me. And so basically he stated that the enemy will rob you of your faith and that he will try to take it from you at all cost.	
2	You will be faced with disappointment. You'll lose a end you lose a job and a loved one will you know will pass away and you'll begin to have doubts and so that really struck me because as you know, I had lost my relationship with my boyfriend. So I lost a friend I lost my job. And of course my son had passed away. And so yeah, I was having doubts, you know, I was having doubts in every aspect of my life at that point and then This faster. His name is Ryan Leak. And you know, I he suddenly said surrender and the more that he spoke the more that his words like really hit home with me.	
4	And so he stated something along the lines of the more I get to know Jesus the more I should give up control of my life grow in your faith and Surrender and he just kept saying that over and over so after the service I wanted to so badly fix my relationship with my ex boyfriend and you know I try to talk to him, but he and I couldn't even have a conversation at this point, you know, and so I remember just literally feeling like I had lost my mind, you know, he was my best friend and I couldn't even talk to him anymore. So I couldn't handle any more darkness and negativity in my life. And I remember driving home from his house and feeling like I just didn't want to go on with life and I sat in my car. I was devastated. I was crying I was screaming and finally I was like here take it Take the Wheel. I don't want it anymore. Take it you need to take control of my life, you know, and I remember screaming.	
2	Aiming and anger and I was broken and I was upset and you know, all I wanted was for this nightmare to end. I wanted my son to be alive and I wanted my life as I once knew it to just be back but I realized that that wasn't going to happen. So I just kept existing literally. That's all I was doing and I was trying to alert like relearn who I was or who I was becoming because the person that I was one that I that I used to be no longer existed and so I kept going to church on Sundays and like I said, I kept existing and so in the meantime the	
4	You know, it was just through this Darkness.	
2	I consume myself basically in my son's social media and trying to find answers and things like that.	
4	And so throughout all of this and threw me trying to find Healing all of a sudden kids started reaching out to me in my life through my son Zachary Snapchat and they started sharing.	
2	Their own stories with me their own pain their own suffering their own thoughts of suicide and somehow talking to these kids and sharing exact story was making a difference in me. It was it was sort of healing, you know to feel like I was able to help these kids just by listening and so	
4	I kept going to church and it was funny my ex kept coming to church to and we would like sit next to each other.	
2	But we really wouldn't say much to each other and one day I get a text message from him and he says to me if you read nothing else, please read Romans.	
4	And so I said, okay, I'll give it a go and I remember that. I was sitting Reading through Romans and all of a sudden. I read something along the lines of we're all imperfect and our bodies are sinful and The laws written in the Bible. They're just they're simply to show us how sinful we are and that all we have to do is believe that Jesus died on the cross for our sins now. When I read this, you know, I kept reading it over and over like what it didn't make sense to me, right?	
2	So I kept going back and I kept reading that, you know sentence where it said that the law is written our are only there to show us that we are sinful that our bodies are sinful.	
4	And so when I read that and then I kept reading	
2	The part where it was like, you know, all you have to do is believe that Jesus died on the cross and shed his blood for our sins.	
4	It was like this physical weight lifted off of me everything that I had been taught in the Catholic religion, you know, you have to follow the rules or you know, you're going to go to hell you have to abide by like just everything that I had been taught. It was like out the door. It was like kind of like I was deceived my whole entire life and I kept it was I became like kind of addicted to this.	
2	You're reading just because of the way that it made me feel it was just I can't describe it to you. But literally I felt like this physical weight just lifted off of my shoulders and I was like what I can be imperfect and I can go to heaven and be accepted and beloved like it was just mind-blowing to me that it was that simple that religion was that simple and so	
4	in a matter of months it was as if I started to slowly regain my strength, you know, so I went from having PTSD episodes multiple times a day and you know, these PTSD episodes that I would have these anxiety attacks panic attacks.	
2	They were physically draining and you know, why lie	
4	Was having these attacks at the same time. I kept getting thrown into the role of helping teens who were struggling but soon I went from like literally having multiple panic attacks a day to like maybe once a month once every other month and I completely stopped taking the medication for them even even to this day.	
2	Like if I feel like an anxiety attack coming, you know, I just I'm able to take deep breaths.	
4	I'm able to bring myself back down.	
2	And so I started to kind of just take on that role or felt like really I was being thrown into this role of helping teens who are struggling, you know talking to parents of teens who were struggling and somehow I started helping guide them through our story and our experience with Zachary. And so I started noticing that my own children started, you know started showing signs of healing and I somehow knew at some point in time that my ex-boyfriend was also being restored. You know, he himself was grieving and his own way.	
4	And so, you know, he he was carrying his own pain and I just feel that both of us carrying the weight and the pain that we both were at that very moment, you know.	
2	Was it was as if God intervened and said okay time out you guys need time apart because I am going to work on the two of you individually and you know suddenly I started watching him evolve into this completely different person.	
4	It was he was still the same person, but he was like a better version of himself, and it was just amazing to	
2	To to really watch it was as if truly God was healing him and healing me at the same time and then suddenly I just knew like Hey, we're going to be okay and we're going to get back together and we're going to be stronger than ever and so in the meantime my farm began to flourish, you know with people renting out this building and literally I was meeting all types of people with all types of different stories and backgrounds.	
4	and people would open up to me and share their own pain and their own suffering and you know, it was I wasn't even applying for jobs at this point because you know, everything was going so good with this rental of this building, but all of a sudden literally a full-time job just like fell on my lap, and if you would have talked to me 13 months ago, I would have never ever	
2	Ever ever imagined my life to be where I am today 13 months later.	
4	And so I am now beginning a New Journey in my life where I've been offered to run my own support group and it's for parents of teens who are struggling with behavioral and emotional health. And so there was a point in time where you know through Mental health awareness week.	
2	I shared our story and it was put out in the paper and then they made like a one minute video clip of me and through this organization called Nami and so not me was getting such a high response from our story that they literally reached out to me and they were like, hey, you know, how would you feel about running your own support group and you know, maybe possibly	
4	talking and sharing your story even more and so	
2	You know, I I I believe that it was just this leap of faith that I needed to take. You know, everything was just it just Wow's me to be honest.	
4	So at this point in my life, you know my house my farm, they were all transforming into like this place of healing for total strangers that were in need and my boyfriend and I are now back together.	
2	And I do believe that we are stronger than ever. I've watched him transform into this admirable man.	
4	And you know, he's flourishing and his own career and succeeding in his own life, and I just couldn't be more proud and ask for a more supportive partner supportive partner.	
2	I can't even talk.	
4	But literally I have been thrown into this in too.	
2	Purpose that 13 months ago. I never even knew existed through my pain and my suffering and then now, you know, I'm not even seeking it guys like it's literally just falling on my lap. I mean, there's no other way to describe it. I'm getting thrown into this role and and literally it's like I'm being led to it. You know, I never wish my pain of losing my beautiful son. On anybody not even my worst enemy. Okay, but this kid is is changing lives through me. And just to watch it all unravel. It's just mind-blowing. You know, my purpose now is to help other teens see that they're created and love and need to hold and hope hold on to hope I should say, you know, my purpose now has become to teach these kids who are living in the now and and feel like they're not loved and feel like they're	
4	Worth it. You know my purpose is to share our story and help them see otherwise, and so I never knew. I had always heard right that were all born for a purpose, but I never really knew that right because throughout my whole entire life. I had never really found my own purpose.	
2	And so before Zach died. I lived my life day-to-day the best way that I knew how I did what I could to provide for my children, you know, but it was it was really truly my son's Journey that Has led me to where I am today. And so he has shown me the way to eternal life and I couldn't ask for I couldn't ask for more.	
4	You know II can't explain it to you. I can't convey it to you.	
2	I can't even comprehend some days how I got here, but I can tell you that there's one word and that can describe it all and so that word to me is faith.	
4	When you're at your worst just hold on to your faith because it will lead you to your purpose. You see we're all created in love but we are taught to live with rules that don't even apply and that creates fear in us. We are afraid of a god that is loving beyond your comprehension. But when you believe he will fill your soul with his spirit and he will lead you to be	
2	The best version of yourself he is such a loving God and such a forgiving God that he will lead you to your destiny. He will guide you and he will open doors and he will move mountains that you never you know, you never even thought imaginable and he will help you find what your purpose in life is. I'm sharing this because I feel that I'm a testament of his grace and with Fireside I can tell you that evil will never Prevail no matter how broken you are no matter how alone you feel no matter what life has thrown at you he will carry you through if you just hold onto faith my life summed up, you know in the in this first episode.	
4	I'm going to be wrapping it up here soon. but	
2	By far I have had the least. You know, my life has been just imperfect right trust me when I tell you I have been through.	
4	What I feel is like hell on Earth losing my child completely just broke me and you know living through my daughter being sexually abused. I mean all of these things it would have been easy to just throw in the towel and not have any hope and lose all of my faith. But the one thing that I did through this whole entire journey is I held on to the little faith that I could and I'm telling you that he has showed me Grace that I never thought imaginable. He will lead you and he will guide you and he will heal you when you least expect it and it's going to be Way Beyond your Asian and Way Beyond your expectations and so I'm going to go ahead and close this first episode of this podcast by saying that you know when my son died we found a notebook and in that notebook. My son had wrote. My favorite Bible verse is Jeremiah 29:11 and everywhere that while I was going through this, you know healing process. We're that I turned I would see Jeremiah 29:11. And so this is what it says for. I know the plans that I have made for you says the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future so I'll wrap it up there by I'm telling you I am a testament of Grace and my goal is to have tons of people on this podcast show, you know sharing their own stories of Grace. I really encourage you to please feel free to contact me comment. Share your stories with me. I want this podcast to be as interactive as possible, but more importantly I Want it to be inspirational to those of you who feel like you have? No. Hope I want to say to you to please hold on pain ends and keep your faith. God bless and until next time.
