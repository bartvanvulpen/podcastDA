3	So basically a little bit about Emma and eyes modeling background her and I model for found Model Management in Columbus, and we have been for almost three years now and then you want to talk about what we're doing business was yeah.	
1	So being in the industry for a while we've gotten to like kind of get a clue in on some of the things that are that need tweaking. Recently things have to do with scheduling that have to do with communication with your employer or your agent and the most important thing which is your finances like your livelihood. The reason anybody has a job. We just kind of noticed that there it's not easy being pretty getting but yeah, it is a problem for models as independent contractors to get a good grasp on what they're doing with their careers like within the industry or as talent in general. It's hard to have good communication with your agent. We're using things like emails and texts and calls things that you can miss and then both ends miss out on a job. If we can't get in contact scheduling. We don't know when anything is going on because we don't get to choose like to block off a set of certain dates to say no we can't do this by looking at this job and it makes it hard on your agency to because they're like, well if we don't know when we can book you and we don't know when we can book this person. We're losing out on jobs that way too and all that kind of leads them to your Finances like if we're missing out on jobs, you don't know what job mattered when or you don't get like itemized statements of when you did a job for how long it makes it really hard to manage your own career. And I mean the modeling industry is something that maybe people see us like Glitz and glamour but it's hard to control. It's a little messy and a little vague Yeah.
