3	Mustafa knew he was dying. The old Taylor's lungs felt like an arid desert he half expected sand to gush forth with every dry cough his wife grew. He had found him on his hands and knees in his Workshop wheezing like a dying bore. She bathed him and helped him rest, but it did him. No good. He only got worse. Worse growing weaker with every passing day. She stayed by his side day and night her hands wrapped around his she prayed that Allah would spare her husband, but Mustafa knew better. It was not a laws will that had caused him to fall ill it was their son Mustafa knew the boy was a rascal. He did not have good manners at supper. He mumbled through his Prayers and would spend all day running about the streets with the other irresponsible children. If he was not careful his son would grow up to be a thug or a bandit and Mustafa could not have that one day Mustafa had caught his son before he left in the morning and sat him down in the workshop. He told the boy that he must learn a trade or he'll be left behind by the world with the best. Beggars and the thieves but as Mustafa did his best to pass on his expertise the boys gays kept straying from the thread toward the open window Mustafa had pricked him with the needle to ensure he was paying attention in retaliation. The boy had grabbed the bolt of cloth off the table and thrown it on the floor stomping it for good measure then he ran out the door not watching. See his father's disappointed gaze. It was then that the illness struck Mustafa bringing him to his knees. The timing was not a coincidence mustafa's heart gave out when he realized his son was hopeless. He was dying of grief because that Rascal Aladdin would never amount to anything. I'm Vanessa Richardson, you're listening to Tales apar cast original every other Saturday.

We're beginning the story of Aladdin's wonderful lamp and iconic Middle Eastern fairy tale about a lazy boy whose life is changed when he discovers a magical lamp since its first appearance in the 18th century. Aladdin has become one of the most famous famous fairy tales in the world and has been translated into almost every language. Aladdin's wonderful lamp was first introduced to the Western World in the legendary collection of Eastern folk tales 1001 Nights alongside Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves and the legend of Sinbad. The Sailor Aladdin is one of the most famous stories in this collection. However, this story in particular is not a part of the original Take text it was added to 1001 Nights in 1717 by French translator on 20 gallon gallon was the first European to translate 1001 Nights and all early English versions are based on his interpretation several of the tales. He added to One Thousand and One Nights including both Aladdin and Ali Baba and the 40 thieves are called The Orphan stories a nod to their a Since in the Arabic version, the original story of Aladdin was told to Ghulam Bhai Syrian Storyteller Hannah diab, though. Diab only received brief mentions in gallons diary. He is now believed to be the true author of Aladdin by historians following the discovery of his Memoirs in 1993 D ABS life story contains several parallels with the story of Aladdin particularly an incident where a traveler claiming to Is magical powers invited diab to go on a treasure hunting adventure with him on his first Tomb raiding Expedition, diab found both a ring and a lamp. These items may have planted a seed in his imagination that eventually grew to become the tale of Aladdin and the wonderful lamp. Life was good for Aladdin a boy of 15 years old. He didn't have a care in the world. He lived in a small hovel with his mother, but that didn't bother him. He only went home to sleep and eat after all his days were spent running up and down the street with the other boys playing pranks on Traders and the bizarre and gawking at visitors from far off lands. As far as Aladdin was concerned the Three of alka loss was the perfect place to live. He had friends. He enjoyed himself and he no longer had an overbearing father trying to teach him a trade. He couldn't imagine anything better until he ran into a stranger from a far-off land Aladdin was out as always chasing his friends through the narrow Alleyways when he turned a corner and collided with a tall robed man falling Hang on to his back dusting himself off. He stood to resume his game. But then the stranger caught him by the arm Aladdin fought to free himself, but the man's grip was like iron The Stranger was tall with dark skin and a piercing gaze. His beard came to a point on his chin and an ornate cane was clutched between his fingers though. He did not appear to need it to walk. There was a curious look in the older Man's eyes that caused Aladdin to stop struggling The Stranger asked his voice soft as sand. Where do you think you are going boy? None of your business Aladdin retorted? Who are you? My name is nasrallah. I come from the land of the Setting Sun and I have been looking for you. Suddenly the man burst into tears and wrapped his arms around Aladdin Aladdin was too shocked to do anything. But except the Embrace and wait for the man to stop crying when he pulled away nasrallah wiped his eyes and offered A hurried explanation. He had heard of the death of Aladdin's father and had come all the way from his home in Morocco to see what had become of his brothers family. Aladdin blinked in Surprise brother. He didn't know his father had a brother but nasrallah's outpouring of emotion was so Earnest. He couldn't help but believe him nasrallah told Aladdin to hold out his hands Aladdin complied and he deposited two gold Dinars into them Aladdin gaped at the money. He had never seen so much gold. In his life nasrallah told Aladdin to take the coins to his mother and have her prepare a meal he would dine with his nephew and sister-in-law tonight. Aladdin returned home early that afternoon his mother Rue he nearly knocked over her loom in shock when he came through the door. She clearly had not been expecting him until supper Aladdin handed her the money and told her what nasrallah had told him Ruiz eye brows knit in confusion. She told her son that Mustafa indeed had a brother but he was long dead this strange man must An imposter Aladdin insisted. She must be mistaken. He cried upon meeting me saying he saw my resemblance to his brother Wu he finally relented and prepared a meal for that evening when nasrallah showed up that night. He greeted ruhi with a hug which she accepted with a little hesitation ruhi looked him up and down. How do you know my My late husband Aladdin was confused by how she phrased the question since he had already told her. They were brothers. Nasrallah smiled and began his story. Mustafa and I traveled together for many years when we were young, but as we cross the desert a terrible storm separated us. I assumed my brother had died. So I settled in the maghreb news of his survival and eventual death reached me only a week ago and I traveled here to see what became of his family it seemed a perfectly reasonable explanation to allow. Didn't his mother seemed to let her guard down after that as they sat down to Ruiz delicious feast nasrallah turned to Aladdin. So young man. What trade did my dear departed brother teach you Aladdin was silent for the first time in his life. He felt shame for having spent his entire youth playing with the street urchins and neglecting his Studies he bowed his head mumbling. I don't know a trade nasrallah exclaimed what your mother spend yarn to support you both and you have not yet learned a trade. What an ungracious child you are. Aladdin's head bowed even lower until he was an inch away from smothering himself in his own supper. Well nasrallah continued stroking his beard if your father's trade was not to your liking perhaps I can teach you my own. How would you like to learn how to be a merchant? Do you fancy people calling you? Khwaja Aladdin perked up immediately. He would rather be a Roman Merchant, then the lowly Taylor. His father had wanted him to be he cast a glance over to his mother whose eyes had already filled with hopeful tears. They both begged this strange man to Mentor Aladdin. Nasrallah's lips curled into a smile. Of course, he would he would come and visit early the next morning and take a ladin on a tour of the merchants quarter after the meal nasrallah departed leaving his promise hanging in the air behind him. Aladdin did not sleep a wink that night he lay in his small bedroom picturing himself as a wealthy and prosperous Trader known from Arabia to the cities of China. Khwaja Aladdin. He fancied himself the title suited him well, true to his word nasrallah knocked on his door Before Dawn Aladdin barely had time to dress himself before the strange Moroccan whisked him out the door and into the bustling streets of Alcala has Does Rolla LED Aladdin into the hamam baths were Aladdin had the dirt of the streets washed away from him then they went to a clothing store where nasrallah had the merchant give Aladdin a suit of fine silks refreshed. They set off again weaving their way through the bazaar as they went nasrallah pointed out each Merchant stand to Aladdin explaining the ins and outs of his chosen. Russian once they were through with the merchants quarter nasrallah brought Aladdin to the richest parts of the city even showing him the gates of the Sultan's Palace by the time the sun dipped low in the Horizon Aladdin's head was spinning with all he had learned he asked nasrallah if they should be heading home now nasrallah replied. We have only one last stop to make before we return He Took a lad in by the shoulders and guided the boy out of the city following a path that only he could see as the sky darkened above them. Then when the city was almost completely out of sight behind the hills nasrallah stopped and said here is where you will make your fortune nasrallah reached into his pocket and brought out a Small box he opened it and the scent of incense struck Aladdin's nostrils making him gag. The Moroccan began to mutter strange words under his breath the sand shifted around their feet as if sculpted by an invisible wind Aladdin watched dumbfounded where the sand once was there appeared a large stone slab with a copper ring fixed to it. Aladdin was horrified. He didn't know nasrallah could do magic. He had been told never to trust Wizards Sorcerers or magicians consumed by Panic. He turned to flee back to the safety of the city moving faster than Aladdin thought possible nasrallah caught the boy by his new silk collar, then he struck Aladdin with the back of his other hand Aladdin sprawl. Onto the dirt nose bleeding. Why did you hit me? So Uncle nasrallah looked at him with blazing eyes. Oh my nephew. I want to make you a man do exactly as I tell you and you will be richer than all the kings that have ever lived. At his uncle's Direction Aladdin approached the Rock and gripped it by the copper ring. He pulled with all his might just when he felt his muscles about to burst The Rock split in two and opened for him below a stone staircase descended into the Earth. A chill ran up Aladdin spine his uncle told him there was Treasure here, but to the boy it looked more like a tomb. In a moment Aladdin goes underground and finds a treasure that changes his life forever.

Aladdin stood with his uncle nasrallah before the cave. He looked over to nasrallah the Moroccan man had been so kind to him and his mother but had kept so many Secrets. He had not told them how he knew magic and he had not told Aladdin he would be brought to an underground vault at the end of their day out nasrallah brought Aladdin clothes and gave him instructions. In the cave Dear Boy, you will encounter all manner of treasures. If you touch a single one, you will turn into a black stone and remain in the cave forever. He then raised a finger but in the deepest recesses of the cave, you will find a lamp bring it to me and your reward will make you and your mother. Are the richest family in your city? Aladdin agreed just one more thing. Nasrallah said placing a Signet ring on the boys finger. This ring will protect you from all hurt and fear. You may encounter in the cave. But only if you follow my instructions to the letter and with that nasrallah stepped aside and let Aladdin enter. The air was cold as Aladdin descended his eyes tried in vain to adjust to the Gloom as he felt blindly with his hands. The rock walls closed in Tighter and Tighter as he passed the first Archway for a horrible moment Aladdin worried that the walls would squeeze the air out of his lungs just as the thought crossed his mind the cave opened up. Round him a strange otherworldly blue light filled the tunnel. The path ahead of him was divided into four different entryways each one led to a pedestal on each pedestal was a Jar full of gold following his uncle's advice. He did not touch them instead. He explored each pathway until he found one that continued past. It's tempting altar. The walls around him opened up. Once again this time he found himself in a lush Garden full of trees instead of fruit. These trees bore iridescent gemstones. The size of Aladdin's fists their light played off the walls in beautiful splashes of color Aladdin gaped at this Grove as he passed through at the end of this Grove Aladdin. Spied a ladder. He took the wrongs in his hands and climbed hand over hand until he reached the roof of the cave in an Alcove carved into the Rock sat and oil lamp a small yellow flame burning and its nozzle with a quick breath Aladdin extinguished the flame. Then poured its contents out onto the cave floor. Once it was empty. He stored the lamp in his pocket and went back down the ladder. But on his way back Aladdin stopped in the garden. There is no harm in picking some of these crystalline fruits. He thought to himself he reached up grasped the nearest one and twisted it off its stem when he did not turn into obsidian the boy breathed a sigh of relief and continued filling his pockets as soon as he was satisfied with his haul Aladdin made. His way back toward the entrance every footstep was heavier than before weighed down by the treasure burdening Aladdin's Pockets. The star-filled sky sparkled pleasantly at the mouth of the cave Aladdin lumbered his way up the stone stairs cumbersome step by cumbersome step, but when he reached the final ledge, he realized it was too tall for him to get over by himself. Nasrallah loomed into View cast in a burning silhouette by the campfire behind him. Help me up on Google Aladdin pleaded he had too much treasure in his pockets to lift himself out of the cave. Give me the lamp and lighten your load the sorcerer commanded but Aladdin could not reach the lamp in his pocket. It was to buried beneath the gems. He pleaded with nasrallah, but the magician was adamant. He would not help Aladdin up until he had the lamp in his hands Aladdin felt the gems once more Imagining the new life. They could help him lead. He couldn't part with these gems. He crossed his arms and told nasrallah firmly, either you help me out now or I stay down here and the lamp stays with me. Nasrallah cursed him. So be it. He said he opened his box and began to rant in that same unintelligible language that had revealed the cave fire Rose from the logs behind nasrallah and circled the cave entrance Aladdin realized his mistake and pleaded with him but his uncle did not respond. The last thing I Aladdin saw were his uncle's eyes lit by fire framed by shifting Rock a moment later. The stone above Aladdin's head closed plunging him into complete darkness. Aladdin sat in the Blackness weeping clearly this sorcerer was no relative of his he had come to exploit Aladdin for some inscrutable reason. What would a man from the maghreb want with a lab? Anyway, didn't they have lamps in Morocco? He fumbled his way into the darkness seeing if he could find his way back to the Garden, but the forked path had been blocked off as Well, he was thoroughly entombed Aladdin could not tell how long he sat underground days weeks years without the Sun or any light to speak of it did not matter his hunger. Nod at his gut and the air grew heavy around him feeling faint. He fell to his knees and prayed to Allah. He clasped his Anne's imploring to be delivered from this plight as his knuckles brush together. He felt the cold metal of the Signet ring upon his finger nasrallah's ring the darkness receded ever so slightly as soon as he had rubbed the ring it emitted a soft red glow. Like there was a flame encased within its Jewel a plume of smoke seeped through his fingers and resolved itself. To a cloud before him a man emerged sitting cross-legged in the air. He was clad in simple trousers and a cap, but the same red glow emitted from him Aladdin gaped in Wonder. This was no man, but a gin a lower Spirit who was bound to the ring the Djinn spoke your slave between your hands is here ask what you You will have me I am bound to serve whoever owns the ring. Aladdin could not believe his luck in his greed. Nasrallah had given him a method of Escape. He whooped for joy and made his request. I demand that you set me upon the face of this Earth the world around Aladdin burst into white light rendering him temporarily blind as his eyes. Adjusted he realized he stood by the buried entrance to the cave. Now in daylight nasrallah was nowhere to be seen but he could smell faint incense upon the are not wasting any time Aladdin ran back toward the city hands clasped firmly around the ring that had saved his life. Aladdin's mother was weeping when he returned home. She told him he had been gone three days and implored to know what became of their strange benefactor Aladdin told her the whole story from the Market Street to the Betrayal at the cave. He then gave the lamp to his mother the jewels he stored away in his own room Rue. He despaired that they were back to where they started her without much. You besides we've yarn for a living and him without any career prospects not so mother Aladdin said we can sell this lamp nasrallah wanted it so badly. It must be worth quite the handsome price Rue he agreed and brought out a towel to polish the tarnished item. She had only been cleaning the lab for a moment before a cloud of smoke burst forth from it. She recoiled in horror but Aladdin grinned in Delight. He knew what this smoke mint another gin appeared before them. But this one crackled with power in a way the Jinn of the Ring did not it was so large its form filled their small hovel to the roof. What would you ask of me? I am a slave to whoever owns the wonderful lamp the Jinn stated when his mother was unable to form words Aladdin spoke up. My mother and I are hungry. Would you fetch us a fine Meal please your wish is my command return to the Gin he vanished and within moments. And with a feast Fit For A King gold and silver trays stacked high with Meats of all sizes. This Feast lasted Aladdin and his mother for two whole days when they had finished Aladdin suggested rubbing the lamp again, his mother refused. She was terrified of the enormous Jin who had appeared so suddenly in her home. She thought they should get rid of the lamp immediately Aladdin had no intention of getting rid of the lamp or the ring as a compromise. He took the platters from their fine meal. And one at a time brought them to market for sale the silver in them fetched a great price and soon rule. He no longer needed to spin yarn to support them both whenever they needed more money Roo. He left the house and Aladdin would call for the jinnee of the lamp to bring them another Feast on ornate trays in this manner summoning food and selling off the platters Aladdin Andrew. Ooh, he elevated themselves from poppers to upstanding middle-class citizens. They never revealed where their prosperity came from and continue living in their modest hovel not wanting to invite any undue scrutiny from their neighbors Aladdin's change in status brought with it a change in character. He no longer wasted his time playing in the streets with the other Poor Boys instead. He spent his days. The market learning as much as he could from the merchants and travelers there as he grew from a boy into a man. He became known to every shopkeeper in the bazaar one day while at the market allowed exclamation caught Aladdin's ear a messenger from the palace spread the word throughout the Market Street. Everyone was to shut their doors the following day and not venture out. The Sultan's daughter lady Benadryl Beador was paying a visit to the Hammam bath house and no one was to look upon her. This was punishable by death. But while all his Merchant friends humbly complied with this decree Aladdin's interest was peaked. There was still a glimmer of Mischief within him. He had heard rumors of the ladies Beauty and he wanted to see if they were true. When the day arrived Aladdin stationed himself in the corner behind the door of the hamam bathhouse waiting intense anticipation sure enough at around midday the door to the bathhouse creaked open and a woman entered alone Aladdin watched from the shadows as she lifted the veil from her face. Aladdin could not believe his eyes gazing upon the face of bhadrashal Beador Aladdin offered a silent prayer to Allah thanking him for creating such great Beauty. The lady turned and Aladdin pressed against the wall squeezing himself into the doors Shadow. He wanted nothing more than to profess undying love and loyalty to this woman. But if she saw him here He would lose his head her eyes gazed an Aladdin's Direction. He kept himself as still as he dared staring back into her stunning Auburn eyes. Aladdin was an inch away from Death staring at the loveliest woman in the world. He had never been so afraid and so entranced at the same time the moment passed and Boudreau Beador. Or went to prepare her bath Aladdin slipped out the window onto the empty Street as he stole his way back towards his hovel the face of the lady never left his mind. He would not rest until he could have this woman for his wife. Up, next Aladdin attempts The Impossible and proposes to the Sultan's daughter now back to the story. The sultan was pleased with his own reputation. He was exceedingly popular amongst his own people for his open and generous manner every day. He would hold Court in his Palace and invite any citizen rich or poor to air their grievances before him. He was a truly magnanimous ruler and while the sultan dealt with the concerns of the people his grand vizier Idris dealt with Concerns of the state together they were a perfect match a genial face for the people and a hard fist for the politicians as he held Court one day the sultan called a dress over to his side. Look here. I am almost certain that woman has been standing in the corner every day for the last few weeks the vizier nodded. He had also noticed her a pauper. / who waited at the gates like all the other concerned citizens, but never came up to speak her presence puzzled these two men. Come forward my dear woman the sultan commanded indicating the Pauper she shuffled to him eyes cast down word. He continued explain to me why you came to visit my Palace the woman was silent for a moment. Then she requested all the courtiers and advisors be sent away. What she had to say was for the Sultan's ears alone. Orhan, all Dean was baffled by this request but his confusion was overruled by his curiosity the sultan had the room cleared until it's only occupants were himself the strange woman Andy dries, finally the woman Rose to meet his gaze. She introduced herself as ruhi and gave a strange request her son. Aladdin had fallen so deeply, Deeply in love with bad real bad or he no longer took any pleasure in life. He barely ate did not sleep and every time he spoke it was only of her. She said that her son requested to take lady bad real bad or for his wife the sultan and vizier burst into peals of laughter and Yet the woman remained stone-faced she brought up. All out from beneath her robe and uncovered it light of all different colors issued forth causing the sultan to squint as his eyes adjusted. He realized that the bull was full of enormous iridescent gems each one larger than the finest he possessed. He couldn't believe it. This peasant woman held in her hands as much wealth as his. Entire treasury, this is what Ruiz sun was offering for the lady's hand. Borja on Aldine stroked his beard considering he exchanged a glance with a dress no matter how much wealth this woman had her rough clothing showed that her son was not a good match for bad real bad or and on top of this bad Rao bahadur was betrothed to marry addresses son. Ekrem this proposal could not Stand and yet the sultan wanted those gemstones he rose from his throne and approached the Bowing woman. We thank you for such a kingly gift. We Will consent to your terms in three months time. My daughter will be married to your son this he reasoned was the safest option in three months. These vagrants would have forgotten about their Ploy he took the gems from the woman himself and sheroes shakily to her feet her eyes were wide with disbelief a wise woman the sultan thought some part of her suspect sigh do not intend to marry my daughter off to a beggar, but he smiled at her and thanked her for coming all this way. She turned and exited leaving the sultan. In twice as rich as he was before. The next three months passed with agonizing slowness for Aladdin after his many visits to the jeweler. He knew that the gems he took from the underground Garden must be the greatest Dowry the sultan had ever seen. Why did he have to wait for three months to Wed and then he heard why a rumor floated through the streets soon confirmed by a lavish wedding. And bad Rao bahadur was to be married off to the grand vizier son a crom Aladdin despaired withdrawing into his rooms not opening his doors for anyone sometime later Rue he entered with more foul Tidings my son. I have news for you the vizier son Weds Bud Rabe door tonight. Tonight they will share a bed for the first time something in his mother's words brought Aladdin out of his stupor a bed and idea sparked an Aladdin's mind his tears dried and he felt an impish grin spreading over his face. That night Aladdin sat in his room listening to the sounds of the wedding Festival drift through the streets. He took out the lamp and rubbed it at once the Gin appeared ready to receive Aladdin's command Aladdin gave instructions to the gin. I want you to follow bad Rob adore and her new husband when they lay together tonight, you will bring their wedding bed here straight away. The Jinn responded I hear and obey then he vanished Aladdin sat upright and waited for their arrival. Aladdin had almost nodded off to sleep when another flash of light filled the room an ornate Bridal bed appeared before him a man and a woman were upon it screaming and shocked the man was naked one leg raised as if he had been frozen in fear while straddling the woman the Jinn floated beside the Tableau of interrupted Bliss waiting for his next. Man and Aladdin gave it take this man and throw him into the privy the Jinn through the naked across from over his shoulder and carried him out of the room blowing cold air on his nether regions as he went Aladdin approached the bed lying on it covers pulled protectively up to her. Nose was Lady bad real bad or seeing the fear in her eyes. Aladdin stopped he raised both hands in a placating gesture lady Badger Alba door. I do not wish you any harm. I simply brought you here to prevent the wrong man from enjoying you please rest yourself. With that Aladdin brought out a scimitar and placed it on the covers. He laid down on top of the covers beside her the sword lay between them a promise that he would rather die than attempt to Ravish her. She watched him fearfully, but he did not move from his spot or make a single attempt to touch her Aladdin spent the whole night smiling content that the princess was not spending the night in another man's company. The next morning Aladdin got off the covers and allowed the Jinn to return a crime to the bed the Gin then transported it away Aladdin stretched and went to wash himself the night could not have gone better. He thought congratulating himself on his elegant solution. Not only had he prevented the consummation of their marriage, but no doubt the vizier son would fear going. Into his lady's bed ever again. The next day the wedding Feast continued it was the Talk of the Town a wedding. So lavish that it lasted two nights Aladdin observed this Riley noting how envious all the people were of a crime and his new bride. They would not be so jealous. If they knew what had befallen them last night Aladdin thought to himself that night. He called the Jinn from the lap and once again, N commanded him to Bear the couple's marriage bed to him as soon as they both lay upon it Aladdin proceeded to do exactly what he had the night before having a crime thrown into the privy and laying beside bad real bad or with a sword between them the next morning. He had the couple spirited back. The sultan was perplexed both his daughter and the grand vizier son should be happy. But neither of them spoke much at all to their parents following their wedding night. They wore the expressions of a couple who had spent two nights in a dank cave rather than the second grandest room in the palace this confusion grew into Fury for the sultan after everything he had done to make sure their wedding was the most joyous. Sweating of all time they showed him no gratitude. Not even a word of thanks. The young could be so ungrateful on the second day. He opened the doors of their bed chamber to find his new son-in-law shivering with cold and his daughter's eyes wide with fright a crime run out of the room before the sultan had a chance to interrogate him. The sultan adopted a soothing voice. Trying to calm the resentment bubbling in his gut tell me daughter what has happened to make you look so distressed. Does your new husband displease you the sultan asked his daughter shook her head once again refusing to tell him what was the matter he had enough of her silence and raged. He unsheathed his saber and brandished it over his head. Bed Rao bahadur fell to her knees begging her father to have mercy on her trembling. She told him everything that had befallen them the last two nights the sultan called for a crom who gave the same account. He would not lie with bad rabid or another night for fear of the jinns Wrath borja and Aldean despaired. How could such a promising match have earned the ire of a Jin it was utterly baffling. He turned this story over and over in his head all day as he sat upon his throne trying to figure out some reason behind it. The sultan was so distracted. He barely noticed when the mysterious woman. Whoo, he entered his throne room later that day his heart stopped when he met her gaze the promise. He made her came rushing back into his mind. She spoke up quickly this time. My Lord now is the time you promised your daughter would marry my son. I pray you fulfill This Promise the sultan stood mind working fast the idea of marrying his daughter off to a tramp son still revolted him, but he could not go back on a promise. Before he could take a step off of his throne Idris stepped forward the vizier. Spoke. Could Joe Ling the old woman. He assured her that they would fulfill the promise but that lady bad Rabe daughter's hand was worth more than a bowl of gems. They would need another bowl of gems along with 40 platters of gold dust carried by 40 white slave girls accompanied by 40 black. Unix the woman bowed without protest and left the chamber the sultan clapped his vizier on the back heartily. Well done my good friend by giving her an impossible task. You have protected my daughter against Marrying an impoverished stranger Idris smiled. He was honored to be of service. He said he would have prevented this intrusion, even if it was not his sunset. to marry Lady Bud real Beador But before an hour had passed a strange noise came from outside the palace the sultan and his grand vizier sent a servant out to the street to determine what was causing such a racket. Aladdin's heart swelled with pride as he rode his horse down the streets clad in the finest robes money could buy he was unrecognizable to the people of Alcala has he thrust his hands into his saddlebags bringing out fistfuls of gold Dinars which he cast into the crowds behind him were 80 slaves 40 black Unix and 40 white women each. Carrying a tray piled high with Gold Dust the Sultan's ludicrous request was no challenge for a gin Aladdin only needed to give the spirit an exact description and in under an hour. He had all the Gold Gems and slaves. He needed to impress the sultan seeing the Magnificent Caravan approached the palace door cracked open in welcome. This was all that Aladdin had ever wanted adoration respect and soon a beautiful bride how unambitious he had been all those years ago when the maghreb be sorcerer plucked him from obscurity though. The man was a deceitful Rogue. He had in a way delivered on his promise. Aladdin would be among the richest and most respected Noble. And the city had ever known and the sultan would never know that the man he welcomed in as a prince had once been a lowly Tailor's son.
