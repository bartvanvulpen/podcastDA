4	This is the Sheldon. She mantis traditional Buddhist Kung Fu podcast. There are three things we seek to clarify on our podcast the truth of kung fu the truth of Tai Chi Chuan and the truth of Zen Buddhism out originally Chan Buddhism or Chan Buddhism. I'm your host Richard Del Connor Buddha Jen shenlong founder of Shaolin. She mantis and our school slogan is the ultimate is the ultimate self defense is self-awareness. Right Welcome to The Shaolin.	
2	She man has traditional Buddhist Kung Fu podcast. Today's history lesson takes place in China a long time ago.	
4	How about 1,500 years ago, give or take 100 years or so. So we're going back to the birth of Zen Buddhism. Okay, if you've heard me say it before maybe I'll say it in a slightly different way this time.	
2	Zen Buddhism was accidentally started. It wasn't an intentional. sect of Buddhism bodhidharma came from India to The Shaolin Temple and retired and passed away there. If he had not had a disciple. Everything that he knew would have been lost. He actually wrote two or three books during the eight years. He lived at the temple, but unfortunately those books have been lost during the temple burnings by the Mongolians.	
4	So the actual writings of him unfortunately have gone the original martial arts.	
2	He taught one of the versions are names of it is called the 18 hands of Lo Han or 18 Lo Han. I actually teach one of what's called? Lo Han one of the 18 loja now, I'm actually not entirely certain that these are the original martial art that he taught but it's very possible because I have since met some kalari Paya 2 people from India and compared martial arts and talk to them and they are also adamant that bodhidharma came from their school, which was okay. I accept that so that was cool. They were happy to find somebody who actually knew that I think I shocked him. So anyway, where were we the okay. The first disciple this is the most important part in the chain now with my school Shaolin Chi mantis, although I haven't really created anything new other than the curriculum to format a lot of the intellectual learning. Without a disciple it will disappear. Someone has to teach this to someone else because I'm not going to be around forever and I've never even taught this whole system to anyone. No one has ever graduated my intermediate system in Shaolin. She mantis now my daughter passed the intermediate level in Tai Chi Youth and several or at least a couple people got Donald Trump they graduated. No, they didn't graduate the intermediate level of Buddha Kung Fu so nobody other than my daughter graduating the intermediate level of Tai Chi youth. No one's really graduated any of my intermediate levels surprisingly a my daughter is of course able to do it when she was about I don't know 10 years old or something 12 I'm not sure so at that age, I'm just trying to point out that if she could get that far as an obviously someone else could even get farther.	
4	It's not that undo.	
2	It's not that difficult. Actually.	
4	It just takes a certain kind of warrior spirit and that's what we're talking about the disciple.	
2	You just can't create a do can't just appoint anyone to be your disciple. There are only certain people who can be a disciple. There are only certain people who can teach what you teach who you can teach a lot of people what you teach That doesn't mean they can teach it. It doesn't mean they've really learned. It doesn't mean they really know how to use it. A lot of people come out of the same classrooms and they have much different uses of the information that was disseminated during that class. And so it's up to each person.	
4	So I decide a disciple is a very rare person and we that's why any of us who are Shaolin we realized that the very first disciple who he could was in a sense the most important part of the entire.	
2	Tire chain of Zen Buddhism because without that first disciple there couldn't possibly be a second a third or a fourth or A fifth or sixth.	
4	So the first one became in our religion. That's why our bow is always it's not to bodhidharma.	
2	And that's why most you cannot be Shaolin unless you know what you're even doing. We're not bowing to bodhidharma were bowing to hookah. So anyway the okay I should even told you so much because most people don't know that it's it's, you know, it's easy to see the fakers. So don't don't don't give me the whole week of balance as you mean it I will be very insulted in behalf of who hika.	
4	Hey, this is Buddha. Jayan here. Advertising my album Tai Chi magic one. Actually, I had to I'll tell you something about it. It was originally a 4-track album recorded in about 94 1994. And then 20 years later. I actually were not that many years. Well quite a few almost 20 years later I ended up. Taking the for track and uploading it into Pro Tools into a digital recording a professional recording system that they almost all recording studios use and then I was able to add more instruments to it. I wasn't limited to just four instruments for tracks. So the CD version will you hear some songs on there that I didn't add anything to there's a couple of solo ones and a couple of dueling Pete pause and things so obviously I didn't add tracks to those songs. So enjoy the album Tai Chi o you can also get it at Tai Chi Magic.com that's a Sheldon records website and you can actually order the album directly there Tai Chi Magic One by me Buddha Jen go get it. Budaj in here and I'm going to read to you from the Tai Chi beginner book, which I wrote and I'm on page 171 and I chose this today just because of the title.	
2	I liked it.	
4	It's called differences and similarities and I thought that's an important concept. We all need to appreciate not try to resist or have an opinion about we need to appreciate it.	
2	Here we go differences and similarities the more we focus on our differences the more	
4	We create distance.	
2	However, if viewed correctly our differences end up eventually bringing us all the way around the circle of life back to what we sought to separate ourselves from. The same with similarities the more we seek to be similar the more apparent. Our differences are The Shaolin she mantis Tai Chi short form is of the following history and then it goes on maybe I should just leave it at what I just read. I like that. Well, I guess I'll continue on here we go because this is a Shaolin shamaness. Okay. The shaman She-Man is Tai Chi short form is of the following history. Number one chao-li shoe or Soo AHS you translator to Richard Nixon. Okay, swing look up that guy teach us Tai Chi to both Carl Totten and rouging she Okay, is it okay? I thought it was to Marshall. Ho anyway number two Marshall. Ho also learns. I think it was two marshaled hope and then Marshall taught to those guys. Hopefully I've got this hole right here Marshall. Ho also learns new revised Tai Chi form and teaches rouging she Master rouging she teaches Tai Chi 2 GD French Shifu GD French teaches Tai Chi and eight brocade to Jen Chen lung which is Mee Jin Shan long teaches Tai Chi short form for ten years before master. Gina she contact shenlong to resume Shen's training and yeah, we went back and did a lot with the April K2 particular. Okay other influences Shifu Douglas Wang teaches tight. She does.	
4	She's Jen shenlong 1981-82 and I've come to actually get to know Douglas again in the last few years through the martial arts history museum and come to look at the system that I was of course just a little kid, you know, like, you know in when I started and now as a Stir and understanding the martial arts world and even the politics of it. I'm able to kind of see it from a different perspective. Now.	
2	Let's see the Yang style Tai Chi forms were based upon Chen style Tai Chi forms many many things were changed the Tai Chi short form itself was changing during Yang Liu Chong's lifetime as he experimented and evolved the Tai Chi short form that he taught his family and was passed down may have had variations among his sons the Tai Chi short form. Yung Chen Foo taught the government or the people was forced by the government in his later years the basis for most current versions of Tai Chi was different from the Tai Chi short form. He preferred and taught normally in the past 20 years the Tai Chi's for a short form the Tai Chi short form or as I call it the Yang family Tai Chi short form or Tai Chi Chuan short form of the young family has been an interest of the Chinese government the Jing versions of the Yang style Tai Chi short form have also evolved. Yes and during the 90s. I got to go back and forth to San Francisco and Oakland and see what they were doing in conjunction with China before the Olympics. Okay, let's see. And so I learned some of the anyway in the next book Tai Chi intermediate we will look at each move more precisely and discuss variations techniques applications and traditional Chinese names for the moves will even compare a couple different taichi. Short forms move by move to illustrate both similarities and differences.	
4	But like I said the motive for reading this was the part about up at the beginning as the more you try to be the same as someone else the more you can see your differences and the more you try to be different from other people the more you can see how you're actually similar. So I think we've got to stop trying to look at the differences and similarities and just look at the facts and whether they're different or similar doesn't matter. You just look at them and deal with them appropriately.	
2	Now I shall lend Chi mantis online school The Shaolin she mantis online school is at www.shorelinedentalcare.com. This is a state of the Art Online School providing a regulated Learning System with daily testing video approvals and belt rank certification per the program. You're enrolled in at Shaolin Interactive.

2	for today's history of Shaolin she mantis I'd like to tell you about Larry Dylan Beck at Decker Lake prison, or at least mentioned him and I really appreciate him. He wrote a fine letter of recommendation in the beginning of the Tai Chi beginner book, which you can read and I want to thank him for supporting me and being encouraging and I want to give him I think a almost a certain kind of person to place in the history of our school because when I was creating the name of this	
4	All Xiao Lin Chi mantis. He was helping me with suggestions and ideas. And when I finally did put that together he was able to give me a stamp of approval.	
2	It's not thank you Larry, Dylan Beck, and hey, I look forward to your wall, but I'd like to be in touch with you again. Give me a call.	
4	All right, Buddha Jen here again, and I'm looking at the welcome page at Shaolin Chi mantis.com should be I think just Sheldon she managed.com and you'll end up here or slash index dot HTML so I know I'm looking at it and as I look across the top of the page. I can see the some pictures of the Shaolin Monks actually at the actual Shaolin Temple in China. Okay, and then as we scroll down you'll notice over to the right in the upper right corner. There's a monk with a red robe now. I got his name written down somewhere. But he is the last Abbot of the Shaolin Temple before the government took it over and kicked him out and then kind of renovated it to make it into a theme park. So this fellow is I believe the last course. I'm not sure how legitimate it was because the government had basically taken over everything anyway, but I think he looks like I know he doesn't look like a like a bureaucrat to me.	
2	So that I think is the last Abbott now. I've got a interesting story about I can tell you about the next Abbott and how he kind of tricked China.	
4	So that's a cool story.	
2	Oh, here we go. Let's see now in the left side over here this whole websites. Maybe get breathe. Made that may have to take some of the sidebars off so it works better on the phone. But be honest with you. I'm looking at it on my phone right now and I just expanded the left menu bar and it says enrollment Links of SCM. Now this these things are may be there, but they're really not pertinent I guess anymore because we haven't when I was in Utah during the 1990s. I was very much involved in the amateur athletic Union. And so I had enrollment forms and everyone always had to join.	
4	And then I had insurance for everyone and we had insurance coverage for all our tournaments very inexpensive. So that was a really good deal for us during the 1990s. The amateur athletic Union was really wonderful and I was on the board there for a little while in the Chinese martial arts division. But okay here we go board of directors. So now next one is the enrollment Links of SCM coming down Abbott's office noise always thought that was kind of cool and that's me and that's basically all kinds of links when you're standing there. I wanted to make this a kind of a 3D walk through Temple and eventually I hope I still do and then there's Application form which I don't think is online. It was originally a CGI former when I changed hosts. I didn't rebuild it with the new CGI thing. So I don't know that that apple and same with the Tai Chi use one so they may not be real actually be application forms there and then belt approval form now. That's an important thing that I need to get going because I've got some students who need the belt test right now. And so I need to get that done and I need to get them online for the web school. So I've got some well, I'm not sure I'm up to checks off to find them around. And now usually always printed them in different colored paper the belt test forms or belt test approval forms for shallow, and she mantis were always in yellow the ones for Tai Chi youth were always in pink and the ones for Buddha Kung Fu what the heck are those anyway, here we go belt test rules that link.	
2	I'm sure we'll work and then the biography of Buddha jinshan long.	
4	I wonder what that says this whole website was probably last updated. Well any updates probably 2011 or 12 at the very latest but this was kind of constructed I think around 2007. So it's like 12 years old as website. Okay, Shaolin shamaness released form two or number one now down here. There's some interesting things.	
2	These tours are really cool. The tour number one is an overview.	
4	So as you go from link to page to page you can there's a you'll see a link at the bottom. It says continue this tour and as you bounce from page to page on the tour, it gives you a cross section of a lot of the of a hundred pages. Here you can see the whole thing in like 10 pages or these get a sample at each section and the same with the guests.	
2	But each one is a different type of a sample and there's a lot of sections here. So they're not all inclusive.	
4	There are very different the one for a student goes to different places than a guest would and the one for a disciple goes with a few different places. So yeah, and it's kind of neat and there's an advertisement for Mai Tai Chi magic one and a shirt that says Americans and okay. So, let's see, where are we now? Okay. So now I'm in the middle are The content area of this page. It says welcome to Shaolin Chi mantis. Now the praying mantis to the far left is our official trademark logo designed and drawn by myself and the calligraphy that you see there is not the best copy of that calligraphy. It's like it's anyway, it's not a good copy of it. And if it anyway it says reading down the first top character Xiao the two trees they're side-by-side Arlin.	
2	The next one is chi now, that's not the same. Someone from Tai Chi Chuan, even though it represents Tai Chi that's the chi of Qi Gong and then the next one the next two batches are Tong long, which is praying mantis those last words. Okay. Now what is our student motto? Our motto is truth wisdom and courage what the heck does that mean?	
4	Well, obviously, hopefully it's not that confusing but truth wisdom and courage looking forward to discussing those more later and our school slogan the	
2	Self-defense is self-awareness very very important.	
4	It was always on my business cards. I'll put it back on there. The ultimate self defense is self-awareness. And that's as our school slogan for challenge humanus when I first created the school. All right. Now, there's a special announcement on this page, which probably won't be here when you come to see this page and it says special announcement Shaolin. She mantis will donate 18 scholarships of 2,700 $30 value each 18 SC. Them scholarships times twenty-seven hundred and thirty dollars equals forty nine thousand one hundred and forty dollars to be given away in 2018 shall and she manages going to give away $50,000 worth of kung fu applications must be received by August 1st, 2017. Trial semester starts, September 1st, 2017, one year beginner program of Shaolin shamaness begins, January 1st, 2018. Now what's really was kind of exciting about this?	
2	I also did the art Camacho special award ceremony down in closing our roast.	
4	I usually what it was in Chinatown and I performed for that and as a special gift to Art Camacho everybody was kind of know for the roast.	
2	I included this this deal and told any of the people there that they could actually claim this deal also and offered it to the the people and I'm not sure which came first their dealer this deal. But at either rate I off. offered this deal to them and	
4	So that was kind of interesting to realize that of course most of these people are retired and older martial artists and they were interested in starting over again, but I was a little disappointed. I still couldn't drum up a little bit more enthusiasm for the Shaolin Kung Fu even though the karate and everything is waning nobody's really still promoting Kung Fu alright continuing down this page Shaolin. She mantis is a traditional Chinese gongfu school that includes Buddhism and closed-door teachings Shaolin. She mantis teaches Chinese weaponry.
