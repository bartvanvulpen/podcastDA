3	This is a pack a day podcast Hello everybody.	1.0
1	Welcome to another episode of the packet a podcast your One Stop Shop for all news and Analysis from the green and gold. My name is Mike went along with me Tyler grigorik as always as we turn the corner from free agency. Now toward the draft. April is just about a week away are about one month away from the NFL draft course. That's where the Packers make most. Most of their bread and butter and Tyler you've been doing a lot of work with the draft coming up not just with the cheesehead draft guide but also with your Packer threshold and everything you've worked with so I guess tell us all what you've been working on as far as the draft goes over the past few months.	1.0
2	I mean if you can think of anything draft related, I've probably been working on it. I've got my own personal big board that I've been kind of putting together that I'm hoping to release probably the top 100. I am going to be nowhere near the level that the guys should like the draft. Gar, as far as how in-depth into the prospects I get I'm not able to watch 300 guys. I just don't have the time for that. However, I'm hoping to release the top 100 which would be a first for me. Hopefully working towards maybe a top 200 next year. So but that's kind of hot right now and also the Packers thresholds as one of my I think my proudest little accomplishments that I put together. It's just, you know, I can think Justice mosquito for putting together the hard data and then Then I just kind of put it all together each year and last year. It was relatively predictive. So I decided to do it again this year, even though you know, it's only good to come second year. He pretty much kept to the thresholds that were established under Ron wolf and that and then under Ted Thompson so we can get a little bit more into that, but I'm pretty excited for our show today.	1.0
1	No, I agree. I'm really excited draft is always been kind of my thing as well. I've watched it every year really going back to when I Javon Walker was drafted. I've watched almost every round every year since then so it's been a long time of watching the draft on and on this guy's case and and in recent years I've gone with you guys a little bit with the threshold and what focusing on the relative Athletic score and doing a little more mocking and just reading up lil bit more and kind of paying more attention to people who aren't named Mel. But we look at this year specifically there is a lot going on for what the Packers could do their work in free agency over the past week bringing in a miss the Smith and Billy Turner have really made things a little less clear as to what they're going to do in the draft. They don't have to go get an edge right away. They don't have to go get alignment right away tight end to you probably should but if there's there's still options out there for what Brian go to comes can do and this is the perfect draft class for him to make moves and move around and get the guy. He wants no matter what position it might be a couple.	1.0
2	We agree and I'm so excited for this draft because I don't foresee any more big move from the Packers prior to the draft. I just don't think they have the ammo that they're willing to part with and then also the financial flexibility is a little bit less now that they've kind of, you know revamp the defense through free agency, which is honestly is all going according to my perfect plan for the Packers offseason. And that was to supplement the defense with veteran free agents and then go into the draft and address the off. That's with depth offensive pieces. So I'm very excited for good cuz he can do anything he wants to do, you know, he's going to have to work with patent and the floor to make these decisions and get get this team back to their Championship status.	1.0
1	No, I no doubt about that. And so we'll go back into the thresholds Park pinned on your Twitter at Tyler underscore dress everyone. Go check that out. He has a Google document with the Packers threshold along with draft prospects and whether they made them whether they visited with the team with their combine measurements were and what they can possibly bring to this team. So take a look at that. So Tyler I'll let you just kind of run with it. What are these thresholds at? The Packers are looking at?	1.0
2	Yeah, so as I mentioned before it's it's truly truly the heart. Work has been done by Justice Mesquita. I kind of just piggybacked off of him and but basically a couple years ago, he did a thorough study and evaluated the prospects that Green Bay tends to draft and the guys that they tend to drift towards when they're making their selections and I can honestly tell you they draft athletes for the most part. It's every single one of the positions has a couple thresholds, but they're pretty much all inclusive of basically speed agility and size depending on the position, but pretty much this is Speed and Agility. That's really all they're looking for. They don't care about strength. They don't care about a lot of other characteristics. I think quarterback offensive line and defensive back are and wide receiver. Those are the ones where they care about size for defensive line and Edge. There's this couple special calculations called. Oh my goodness. They're the basically their agility and speed calculations. The exact name of the calculations escaping me. It's not like a super well-known one. But if you ever want to know just reach out to me and I'll do a little bit of digging and I have it in my notes the gentleman who originated the formula, but basically there's a formula that calculates agility and speed using their three-cone time 40-yard dash their height and their weight and their certain threats certain thresholds that have been met in the past and certain thresholds that were looking for moving forward, especially with the Packers needing Edge help. Till I would say that they still need Edge help, you know, it's a good tool to look at and it's been a pretty good indicator and I know Justice Mesquita, he knows its edges, you know, he puts out those Force players every year. So they're pretty root pretty good indicators of relative success in the so I'm very excited to just keep updating it and updating it weekly currently with pro day numbers as new players who didn't test that the combine or players just who are improving on there. Numbers in general I'm pretty excited for what it's become and what it's growing into and definitely going to keep continuing this every year as long as the thresholds are going to hold true. Which last year. I think it was like seven seven of the players seven of the draft picks last year fell Within These thresholds, so I'm pretty excited for how predictive it was last year and what it might indicate this year.	1.0
1	No doubt, and the thresholds do matter but also know thing that matters and apparently Brian could conceive the same way is the res a relative Athletics for only one draft pick did not meet the elite threshold for that last year. That was cool Madison. We look at guys like Kendall diners and Mark was veiled is scamming Equity me saying Brown if they were Elite athletes, they were some of the best of the best at their pro day at their combine whatever and I think that does play a part with how he's guys read the the team drafts whether it is because of the pure athleticism that Baby, he reads the math bomb Twitter or he just has it own stuff that he goes on the pet. The Packers have an act like you said to draft spectacular athletes. And another good example is Oren Burks. He tested through the roof and jumped into the third round conversation could be starting at inside linebacker this year. So the RAS also plays a big part and I guess what did you see from that as far as how that factors in?	1.0
2	Yeah, and if you guys have the time Ross juggling did a fantastic study put together a Packers big bored and he did it pretty much based off the RS for the most part. It's a great read go check it out. And then she said TV, but essentially the relative athletic scores just me. They are comparing athletes for the last 30 or so years. There's a specific year that this dates back to kentley Plaid on Twitter at math bomb to the fantastic fantastic job of putting all this data together and he does it I believe for free. I don't think he gets any money for it, but it's basically a formula that he's arrived and a model and he just puts these numbers out. And what it does is it Compares Compares players relative to other players of their position using their size the height their weight, they're all their testing scores and just kind of puts out what percentile athlete they are in comparison to the rest of the players that were at that position for the last x amount of years. So every single year, it gets more it gets stronger and better indicator of what type of athlete that you're dealing with. With and it's just it's such a great tool and and we're blessed to live in the 21st century.	1.0
1	No, that's a good way to put a we are very lucky to be in the time of laser timing and the internet and everything that happens like that. It makes things so much more exact when you see all these testing numbers and you look at a good example would be at the combine. You look at Andy, Isabella. He his 40 time was originally unofficial for five or so, and everyone was freaking out and be disappointed then they realized that the system was off but then when they corrected it and it being a 4-3, so it kind of shows the difference of how that works in tech technology, but Just before we go into our preliminary kind of fun for around Mach. They were going to go through and just a couple minutes. What's going to be what do you think is the biggest Prospect for your who is the biggest Prospect for you that you think meets all the thresholds that you really want to see it either 12 or 30, you know, and honestly, there's a number of guys that I would love to have it either position.	1.0
2	That's the beauty of this year's draft. However, I do think the Packers are actually pretty much enamored with one specific. Pacific player much like gudykunst says he was last year with Jai you are Alexander. I think that guy could be Noah Fant this year and I think 12 might be just a bit Rich for Noah Fant. If we're being quite honest, I would like to see him taken in the late teens early 20s, if possible. I think that that kind of meets the place where we could see a run on tight ends based off some of the other teams needs and value fits and stuff like that. No offense would be a dynamic player and a dynamic I did. Into this Packers offense and not to take away from TJ Hawkinson, but I think no offense. It's just Far and Away a better athlete even though the relative at the relative Athletic score would indicate. Otherwise, I just think that fan is going to provide more dynamic system from the tight end position than Hawkinson will I think fans are very capable blocker not as not as bad as he's given credit for he definitely has some work to do in the area, but I think he could be a very serviceable blocker moving forward and I think that given that that quality and that characteristic I think that he's going to be heads above TJ Hawkinson career-wise.	1.0
1	And I agree and that's kind of the thing. I've been kind of working on for weeks. And you look at the to Iowa tight ends. I said, no laughs and is Jordan Reed 2.0 T. Jay Hawkins kind of Chris Cooley or me is ceiling would be like a Jason winner Greg Olsen, but I think Fant your said is much more Dynamic his Arias of nine point eight nine. His combine was absolutely incredible and he was a pretty good player for a long time and I will Hawkins to really broke out last year, but fantas been doing it for two three years now and Kirk Ferentz players tend to do pretty well in the end. Whether it's George Kettle, we've seen Now setting records or Scott Shannon had a nice long career in the NFL as well. So Iowa tight ends tend to do pretty well in the NFL and I think there's a solid chance as well that one of them will be in Green Bay for me personally. I am actually in Amber with Brian Burns and all those concerns about his frame and everything, but the Packers need that edge Turner we look at the Smiths. They're very very good players, but having a guy with the speed and build of a Brian Burns gives it that extra dynamic. Thing where you could have all three of them on the field and really cause problems with that as well. But like you said there are so many guys in play at 12 and maybe even trading down into the late teens to get fans or treating up from 30 to get fan because I would be surprised if they take 10 players with with the capitulate is and with with the chance to really get some special players. I think they might trade up a couple of times on maybe they won or at the very least day to as well. Well, I think said to do you think you want to maybe hop into a little bit of a mock draft here before for us?	1.0
2	Yes. We should I'm so excited. Let's do that actually.	1.0
1	Alright, so we are on the draft network. Of course, you can listen to yesterday's podcast with Joel Marino from the draft Network and we're going to use their predictive board go through four rounds and will be manually picking each Packer pick at 12:30 and the to for second and third as well. So as things go along I am solely scrolling through right now. And the big thing right now is Kyla Marie didn't go number one. and so with our pick We do have Brian Burns out there. Both Iowa tight ends out there DK Metcalf is the currently the highest rated player out there for this one as long with along with Devin Bush.	1.0
2	So tell who went one through eleven. Let's let's do a brief. Let's do a brief like one through eleven. See who went there.	0.0
1	All right, if let's do that Nick bow. So it number one to the Arizona Cardinals Josh Allen to the 49ers Quinton Williams joins Leonard Williams on the Jets Devon white, too. The Raiders ratio on Gary goes to Tampa Bay Kayla Marie the newest Giants backup quarterback. We'll see if that goes well John Taylor to Jacksonville Montez sweat is on his way to Detroit and Oliver is in Buffalo Dwayne Haskins will be Joe Flacco's back up in Denver and Andre Dillard the tackle from Washington State goes to Cincinnati with 11 according to this simulation. So Tyler Alice Q if you had to pick which player would you want to take at 12?	1.0
2	Well it to me, it sounds I didn't hear John William. So I think that strong consideration has to be given to Jonah Williams. Now my consideration there with Williams is that I know that there's not a lot of concerns with him being able to move to the right side, but I think he's best suited as a left tackle. Now a lot of those skills are translatable. However, that doesn't mean every single player can go from one side to the other and Not entirely sure, you know that they want to try and do that. It kind of depends. I I think if they take if they take Williams, I think that that's a that's a luxury pick for them at that point. But how about you go through maybe the top ten that draft network has there that at 12 basically?	1.0
1	Okay, their Top 10 Prospects available right now rdk Medcalf the straight line receiver from Ole Miss Drew lock quarterback from Missouri. Brian Burns The Edge from Florida State's. Both Iowa tight ends Fant and Hawkinson back-to-back. Devon Bush middle linebacker from Michigan Josh Jacobs running back from Alabama Christian Wilkins from Clemson Cody Ford Guard from Oklahoma and then Jonah Williams and then greedy Williams right behind them. So there's your top prospects on the board right now according the simulation in round. One and I like the idea of Jonah Williams. I do Wonder like you said it might be a luxury you kind of want a guy who's going to come in right away and play a little bit more do use your top one at 12. But I'd be I'd be leaning toward Devon Bush personally myself get that another Dynamic linebacker to play with Blake Martinez go sideline to sideline and can and he's shown he can be a truly Dynamic player.	1.0
2	I honestly think that this is a this type of situation that we're going through right now is ideal. Feel for a trade down Drew lock is sitting there with some team licking their chops trying to get ahead of the of the Washington Redskins. I honestly think that they could they could get a pretty good haul if they traded out of this position you trade down a few spots, maybe four or five and you're still getting Jonah Williams Noah fan TJ Hawkinson greedy Williams, even who I would be completely okay with Green Bay spending a first-round pick, even though they spent so much draft capital on the position. You know, I you can never have too many corners, especially In and defense, excuse me, like like Mike patents. However, it's obviously a luxury to spend on a corner. I think at this point, I'm not ready to spend a top-15 pick on Devon Bush. That's my honest feeling about that. I think I think Brian Burns would be the selection for me here if if we had to take a selection at 12.	1.0
1	No, I agree with you. And so let's go with it. Brian Burns who again is my draft Crush. So I trust you with Brian Burns again long athletic. He was a productive player at Florida State and he all he does is make plays he can really get after the quarterback. And as we as we've seen from tape with the Chiefs and what Mike Smith likes to do with the outside linebackers, he will get that football. He will get a lot of strip sacks and that is built exactly for what the Packers can do. So as we move to pick 30, so kind of recapping what happened. After Brian Burns was taken by Green Bay and 12 Drew lock goes to Miami at 13 Christian Wilkins to the Falcons DK Medcalf to Washington Jonah Williams to the Panthers replace Matt Khalil a Cleveland Pharrell to the Giants Dalton Reisner to the Vikings. That's gonna hurt Ross Cody Ford to the Titans Devin Bush to the Steelers greedy Williams to Seattle. That's a really good fit there Camille Harry your Arizona State boy to Baltimore Garrett Bradbury to Didn't Josh Jacobs to the Raiders Chauncey Gardiner Johnson the safety from Florida to the Eagles Hakeem Butler to the Colts TJ Hawkinson goes to the Raiders at 27 Byron Murphy cornerback from Washington to the LA Chargers and Mack Wilson from Alabama to the Chiefs. There's a normal name that I didn't just read and I think we're going to take him a 13. That's probably no offense.	1.0
2	Yeah, you're right. We're starting to give the territory where you get to groupthink with these pics, but A reason why the no offense selection specifically to Green Bay is such a popular one. He fits indeed. It's a good fit for the offense on top of that just like every other player. We're going to pick today. He fits what Green Bay is looking for at the position. He meets their thresholds easily. So I think that Noah fan is an easy selection here, but I'm curious who else is on the board. I may be you said it I just missed it, but I didn't hear Drew lock either.	1.0
1	Jewel Ocwen the pick after Brian Burns. He went to Miami got it. So the quarterbacks really kind of check out. So I'll do the top top seven prospects that are not right now. No elephant is the top of the board DeAndre Baker from Georgia is to a corner AJ Brown is third from Mississippi Nasir Adderley is fourth safety from Delaware and the Packer Legacy. Jerry Tillery is V from Notre Dame Eric McCoy from Texas AM Jonathan. Abram is number 7 from Mississippi State and though that's your top seven currently. Peggy's I think fans. It just makes too much sense if he is there a 30 to make the pic he couldn't he's the souped-up version of what your Michael Finley was and I think he'd be a stone-cold solid player for years and years and years and Green Bay Pleasant, you get the fifth year option for a tight end, which is always a good thing.	1.0
2	You know, I have a guy like Chauncey Gardiner Johnson Falls to this spot. I think I'm running to the podium and taking him as well and I pass on fact that I grew because of the value of the position. I think you can get herb Smith I think can get More production out of him probably not as dynamic as no offense, but I think you can get similar production out of Earth Smith, even though we tested poorly and he actually tested himself out of Packer thresholds. However, a guy like nice and icy rattly as well. I'm contemplating that pic here. I think he's the only guy out of that group that you just read through that I'm even thinking about it 30 with with no offense. So on the board, but I think there are some other safety options in the second and third round where we can Ford to pass on Adderley right now	1.0
1	Okay, so let's make the pick will go with Noah Fant from the University of Iowa at 30. So as I go down Diandra Baker to the Rams AJ Brown to the Patriots, of course that happens at Elite of the Colts shikai polite to the Raiders Earth Smith to the Jaguars at 38 for nodal there. Jeffrey Simmons to the Broncos goes to their packers back on the board just in Lane was last one taken for the Detroit Lions Packers back up at pick number 44 other get names that came. Off the board where Jerry Tillery Jonathan Abram Greg Little a money or a Warrior from Penn State. Yeah, I need because you see from West Virginia. Like it's a Jeffrey Simmons Crane Creek Lindstrom from Boston College. So Packers back up and around to pick 44 top names on the board Eric McCoy Le Insight interior lineman from Texas A&M is the top of the board Hollywood Browns there at the from Oklahoma the receiver Kelvin Harmon from NC State Daniel Jones quarterback from do. Duke Dexter Lawrence the massive lemon from Clemson Debo Samuel South Carolina receiver Paris Campbell, Ohio State receiver, then a couple of safeties Deonte Thompson and Taylor rep are the top of the board right now one Thornhill not too far behind them either as well. So Tyler, I'll turn to you year representing the coaching staff with all the film work. You've done. What play would you like to see at 44 for Green Bay of the names that are out there, you know, I look at a guy like Deonte Thompson.	1.0
2	One thornhill's the guy that I've really been toting on social media. He's a guy that fits all of their athletic thresholds. I think he's a very under-the-radar player this year. He's gonna be a good pick. What for whoever takes him in the second round. I don't think he goes any higher than the second. You know, I wish that a guy like Garrett Bradbury. I haven't heard his name, but I'm assuming he's gone by this point. So Garrett Bradbury would be fantastic selection at 30 or 40 for same thing with The other Center I can't members name. I'm blanking on the guy. However, Chris Lynch from he's not Center in Turkey alignment. Sorry Crystal incident from Boston College both.	1.0
1	Yeah.	1.0
2	So yeah, so if either one of them photo 44, I think that that's a great fit as well. I'm not a big fan of McCoy here. I just think that it's not necessarily what I'm looking for. He's a good player. I just not I'm not running to the podium for him personally, but I think Really considering guys like Deonte Thompson lawn Thornhill all three receivers that you mentioned Hollywood Brown Depot Samuel and the other one there with wires Campbell yet. No. No the good news Calvin Harmon.	-1.0
1	Yes, that one.	1.0
2	I think those are the five names that you're really looking at here.	1.0
1	Yeah. No, I agree with you. I think I'd also put a little bit of thought into Taylor rap because just because he reminds me a lot of like a Mike a high type player. He's a smart safety who would really help stabilize things of the a dreamless back there, but I personally think that I think one for who was shooting a really Limited in coverage.	1.0
2	No, I agree. He's just really Limited in the coverage and it's one of those things where Taylor rap is a player where you're taking a high floor with a not much higher. Doing so it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Yeah, you're right. He would kind of solidify the position and he wouldn't be bad but he wouldn't be amazing. It would just be solid and I guess that's worth something but that's not what I'm looking for here. This offense needs Playmakers specifically, I would love Deonte Thompson here. I think that that's a good pick I wouldn't be upset at they took Deonte Thompson 44. I think it's great value specifically considering what he does. He's got legitimate concerns about some of the facts facets of his game one Thornhill. Would be a fantastic selection here as well. He's also got legitimate concerns, but I think that he's going to be a solid selection, but I'm looking at Marquis Brown. I know that I know that he does not fit their traditional receiver, but I do think that that could change a little bit this year with Matt LaFleur the home it's tough to get on board with Marquis Brown because of the lisfranc injury and just how small he is but Man, when you turn on the tape, he is electric and it's just so much fun to watch and to think about what he would provide this not only does offense, but the Special Teams unit Depot Samuel is a close second in that department. He didn't he could just do so many different things and Kelvin Harmon is just solid, you know, you're getting a good receiver of Kelvin Harmon. So I'm good with any any of those five.	1.0
1	Do you have any input there it to me when it comes to the safeties. It depends on what you want with them. Do you want the kind of steady solid all-around player? Beyonce Thompson who who's in who's just kind of good player, but he's more around it or do you want the ball skills of Thornhill former Corner who is really really strong and coverage and he's a guy who's going to create turnovers for you guys. That's the biggest thing for me with the receivers Hollywood Brown does worry me with an injury and he's also very very small and slight so I wonder if that could be a recurring thing Deebo Samuel would be my choice because as if I was going to go receiver because his route running is so Dynamic and I ever You came at the Senior Bowl. He was absolutely making top-flight corners of foolish out there. And and I think he's a guy who stuck drop because he didn't have the greatest year at South Carolina, but he's another solid player for so for me to be down between Samuel and Thornhill, but I'll defer to you if you want you to be one of those okay with you lean toward.	-1.0
2	You know to appeal to the lighter side of things and to the sentimental side of things. I think I'm going to go with Depot Samuel to replace Randall Cobb because you can do a lot of the similar things that Randall Cobb could and I think Matt Le Flore is going to really appreciate a gadget player and he could play inside outside. He can be your returner in special teams. I think that it's a good selection here. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the other four that we talked. About either okay.	1.0
1	So I just made the pick Debo Samuel. Welcome to Green Bay. If this would work out for me getting a Friday which we will be recapping day 2 of the draft on the packet a podcasts ourselves in just about a month or so for now is picks flying off the board. Now as we are into round three just waiting on a few of the simulation to go. Well. Luckily. I have it on the fast timing so that will move fairly fairly well, And now grimby up at pick 75 names that came off since then notable names Daniel Jones went to Washington to do quarterback Hollywood Brown goes to the Panthers Chase winter, which breaks Jacobs hard everywhere. He goes to the Dolphins Dexter Lawrence to the Browns Charles omena Hue from Texas to the Vikings Kelvin Harmon to the Steelers Michael Dieter first Badger off. The board goes to Philly Caleb McGarry and Taylor at back to back to Houston Trayvon Mullen to the Patriots running back off the Cordero Henderson from Memphis to Philly Dan to the Dallas Cowboys rakia sin quarterback from Temple goes to the Indianapolis Colts David Edwards for another Badger goes to the Chargers Julian love gone to the chief Sandy Isabella to the Saints Jason Stern Burger Patriots get another cell a tight end which really hurts the inside Eric McCoy round 3 to the Cardinals Paris Campbell just went off the board Tyree Jackson Off the board to Jacksonville Blake Cashman off the board in a Rasta, whatever. And him to Tampa Bay last pick made was the Andre Walker Edge from Georgia to the Buffalo Bills. So one Thornhill still out there at 75. So the rock in the podium, I read it.	1.0
2	I'm gonna Mash think it let's talk about who else is available.	1.0
1	But yes the top the top five names out there one Thornhill from Virginia Elkton Jenkins from Mississippi State interior. Lineman. One of my other draft crushes miles Sanders running back from Penn State Darnell Savage from Maryland and Emani hooker from Iowa are the top five prospects out there. So three safeties.	1.0
2	Yeah, so am IA hooker himself is a it's a fantastic Prospect. He would be a little Swiss army knife another one for Mike Pettine to use. I think that the pic here has to be one Thornhill though as much as we just talked about him. He fits every single threshold of the Packers were looking for at the position and I think that he would provide a tremendous duo with a dream a journey most because they can both do a lot of different things and I'm honestly just a fan of thornhill's intellectual and instinctual abilities and that's not something you can teach in a Player No, I agree.	1.0
1	Yeah, if you have a trio of Thornhill Amos and then Josh Jones kind of up in the Box. I think you're in good shape. So we'll go with Juan Thornhill there and there he goes Dawson noxious went off the board Savage off the board. Am IA hooker to the Dolphins. So the Dolphins taking all of my topics Damien Harris off the board. Renault Ren from Arizona State to the Titans for you, drew Sammy off the board mile Sanders to the Texans Riley Ridley to the Lions. The hell warring a good tight end of the Cowboys JSA a white side to the Chargers. as we slowly work our way through round three max Crosby Edge from Eastern Michigan to the Jaguars is looking for notable names. This was Anthony Nelson final pick of the round to the Ravens as we're now in round 4, so we have two more picks left in this Mock. And in this podcast David Montgomery just went to the Buccaneers if this if this simulation were to hold So Packers, I'll pick one 14. Last pic was Will Harris from Boston College. So top five I'll go top 10 players. I'm getting later in the in the draft process. Number one Prospect out. There is Miles Boykin from Notre Dame wide receiver Josh Oliver from San Jose State tight end is the second top prospect. Jajuan Johnson safety from Miami Dairy is Slayton from Auburn wide receiver Connor McGovern Guard from Penn State. Antoine Wesley from Texas Tech treyvion Williams from Texas A&M a running back Jacoby Myers from NC State and Dennis daily from South Carolina and offensive tackle are the top prospects on the board according to the draft networks predictive board.	1.0
2	So the two the three names actually that caught my attention. We're Darius Slayton Connor McGovern and then there was another receiver in their mouths Boykin. Excuse me. So both Boykin and Slayton are guys that have Packers I can guarantee you're going to be in love with they blow the thresholds out of the water. I'm looking at the position though, and it's starting to get a little log jammed with a selection of Depot Samuel. Connor McGovern is a guy that I would be looking at in this area and this part of the draft solid solid player, you know, he's a little bit developmental but that's what you're getting in the fourth round. I think that's exactly what they're looking for in their lineman right now. Not only that he fits what they're looking fits their thresholds with the four five seven short shuttle and a 7-6 6-3 cone. Obviously, he fits the size. So I think Connor McGovern is the selection for me here Joel Marino talked about his ability to play in a Zone. Out and also has some lateral Mobility. So I think he fits with the Packers going to try and do in the Run game very well and then you can try and teach him to coach him up. I should say in the passing game. And so I think that Connor McGovern is the selection for me here.	1.0
1	No, I agree. I had as much as I like do the young receivers like slate and Boykin and even Wesley little bit the Packers young receivers. I want to see what they can do this year. And we've already taken Debo Samuel off the board. So I think another you offensive lines the way to go. They do need to fortify it. McGovern's he's going to be a steady player. I think he's going to be a solid player for a long time. And I think that you'd and plus drafting a pure interior offensive linemen will help because years past we've always have two tackles and shifted him in. I think drafting a guy who's been a guard before gives him a little bit of that extra Edge when they come into camp and let you learn the intricacies right away. And so yeah, let's make Connor McGovern The Pick and so just a few more pics is till we get to our gift from the Washington Redskins at pick 118 and there goes miles Boykin right off the bat. So the three picks between McGovern and the current one Justin Hollins from Oregon goes to the Panthers miles Boykin to the Dolphins again because they take everyone that we want and Joe. Jackson of Miami goes to the Falcons So now top guys on the board Josh all over still out there from San Jose State. Jajuan Johnson from Miami Darius. Slaton Antoine Wesley. Treyvion Williams, Jacoby Myers Dennis daily Marquis Blair from Utah Ronnie Anderson from Oklahoma and Demarcus Lodge from Mississippi are the top guys on the board will further down the Border guys, like will Grier Terry Godwin Titus Howard Jared Stidham still on the board a little bit further down house Gaskins still down there as well, but There's still some good names out. There is still some good prospects for pick 118.	1.0
2	Yeah, you know, I'm actually looking to supplement either I linebacker or defensive line here. Now this just to be quite Frank. This is not a good year for inside linebackers specifically when you start looking at the Packers thresholds now their thresholds for linebackers are actually relatively strict. There's never many prospects that meet them. So I think when they see Layers that are close to the thresholds or even meet them they're jumping all over them and there's only a handful of guys that you're probably even looking at here a guy like drue tranquill from Notre Dame. He's on that. He's on the cusp of meeting all the thresholds. A guy from Catholic. I like Cameron Smith from USC. Bobbio correctly from Stanford, but I didn't hear you. Say Caitlyn Saunders. Is he still available the defensive lineman from Western, Illinois?	1.0
1	Let's see interior defense Supply and Kaylin Saunders. I do not see him. Let me go through quickly through the draft. I didn't go through every name. So let me deal with check really quick. Kalin Saunders went off the board to the Indianapolis Colts at pick 89 at pick 89.	-1.0
2	Okay, so that would be a guy I'd be looking at here.	1.0
1	He's gonna so I can do very quickly because hop interior lineman out there right now defensive line. Daniel Wise of Kansas is the top one the David Mack and Kingsley Kiki are the top lineman and top. It'll middle linebackers are David long Tavon, Kony and Gary Johnson. For the inside linebackers.	1.0
2	Yeah, so I think honestly here I'm looking. This is possibly where we might see a running back come off the board. I think we're going to see the Packers pursue a past catching running back a passing specialist running back. There's a couple of them in this year's draft one of the James Williams from Washington State. He might be around five pick. He doesn't meet any of the thresholds necessarily he kind of is just below all of them. I think Miles Sanders is like the only one that meets them. All right now. Tony Pollard from Memphis is a guy who's kind of rising updraft boards as well. So this is where it really starts to get interesting with the Packers decide to do where they did where they decide to add depth, but I think what I'm doing here personally is I'm looking at a guy like dalen mac. So a guy like dalen mac. He's he meets the thresholds for the most part. He's a little little less agile than you'd want him to but he's a true nose tackle. He would take some of the duties off of Kenny Clarke the Packers have already met. With him, once which kind of says a lot to me, they're not meeting with a lot of players at this point, which is very surprising to me as considering the amount of visits at the rest of the teams in the league of had but the Packers have not met with a lot of players. So I feel like they're kind of they've already got their guys that they're kind of like targeting in on day lamech is a guy they've already met with I believe that was back at the Senior Bowl and he's a guy who pretty much meets what they're looking for. He's going to be a specialist guy, but he's gonna he's gonna be a tremendous nose. The NFL he won't provide much more. Other than that, but you'll be a tremendous run Defender and he can provide some juice from the interior as a pass rusher as well. He's got some he's got some nice moves that he likes to whip out every now and then so I'm looking at a guy like Darren Mack here. That would be my value pick and my best fit.	1.0
1	So welcome to the Green Bay Packers daylan machen that a wrap up the six-man draft class for the smartdraft simulation from a draft Network here for 2019 notable players afterwards to the underground forward. Jajuan Johnson to the Browns David long to the Vikings sudden Smith to the Titans Antoine Wesley to the Eagles Darius Slayton to Denver white rate of the Rams. Will Grier going to the Patriots to they maybe get another backup quarterback that could be trade bait in four years. Titus Howard to the Falcons final pick of this for round mock was Michael Jackson from Miami over to Philadelphia. So if there are no trays and in the dream scenario, this would be how the Packers would Shape Up according to what Tyler and I have decided to do Brian Burns goes to 12 and no offense goes at 30 Debo Samuel at 44 one Thornhill at 75 Connor McGovern and 114 and daylan Mac at 118 if That were to be the case and if all these pics were to end up in Green Bay, I would be Beyond ecstatic. I would not sleep very well. I would be full of adrenaline and looking forward to driving up to Green Bay and August for training camp and sitting at the fence watching these guys work in pads and making 2019 one of the more exciting years entering that I've had in a while.	1.0
2	Yeah, this is almost as perfect as it gets and I can almost guarantee. There's going to be craziness on draft night and only Brian gudykunst in his team know who they're looking at and what they're looking for particularly and all we can do is sit here and speculate based off the team needs, but it's fairly how it goes, isn't it? So I can't wait for the draft personally, but if they at they ended up with this kind of Hall addressing so many positions with the value that we got and want Thornhill Debo Samuel Noah fans. I'd be over the moon and I great also folks.	1.0
