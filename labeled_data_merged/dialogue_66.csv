2	Podcast what do you want to call it? You want to say the name? Yeah, it's take 43 and it's take 43 because well, there's a problem. I'm sorry about the other 42 takes I was freestyle rapping and I dropped like oh like is like a lot of f-bombs and so we couldn't use any of those. It's true. He did you know, and but you know, hopefully one day I'll be able to work out like at least 50% of the f-bombs and it can be our intro song.	1.0
1	That's like, that's awesome. So what's cool about this podcast is we're good production professionals. We talk about anything in the production world. Video related we've been doing video for 15 years.	1.0
2	Yeah. I be combined. We probably been doing it for 20. I've been doing it for about 15 old alone.	1.0
1	Yeah, then what is it for quite a while to exactly and it's important to note though that we are production professionals, but we have a lot of experience but there's still a lot for us to learn.	1.0
2	Yeah, absolutely. So we were like we want to impart any knowledge we might have on to you guys. But at same time like we want to hear from you we want to learn from you. We're not going to get everything right? We're not we don't want to Hornswoggle anybody and pretend like we are just like these gurus list everything we have to say take it out to the world. You're going to be successful like like we don't know that for sure. We're just a couple of guys. We like doing this we like talking about it. And so we want to hear from you. We want to know what we you know, do right and what we do wrong and and we want to hopefully give you guys some knowledge as well.	1.0
1	And so I think I think we have a lot of fun along the way totally what kind of comes around goes around and I think that's what this is all about. Just a learning experience and educating both ways. And I think I think we're on the right track for that.	1.0
2	Yeah, I think so. I mean it's certainly the best intro recorded so far.	1.0
1	I see that took forever.	-1.0
2	Yeah, but so like let's do it.	1.0
1	What do you say? Yeah, sounds good. So Aaron, I Start off this this is called this episode is called DNA and it's basically about you and I drew in there and threw an urn. So I want to ask you first Aaron. You know, how did you get started in this and and kind of take me back to that day one where you knew you wanted to do this and kind of give me like a past. Give me like a present. Give me a future as well.	1.0
2	Oh, yeah, you got it. It's like it's actually super easy for me to pinpoint the moment where I knew I wanted to like put, you know moving images on a screen and that would be in the Summer of 1991 when I went to the theater and saw Terminator 2 Judgment Day. How old were you in? 1990-1991 I would have been I was 13, I guess 13 I guess I was too man. So it was my wife.	1.0
1	That sounds like a joke, but it's not my man. My man. Yeah. So yeah summer 1991. I mean I had like I grew up watching movies.	1.0
2	I already loved movies, you know the ones that I watched as a kid over and over again or you know rid of the Lost Ark Goonies like and so in Terminator the Exterminator, which my mother bless her soul. Let me watch as a child. I never scart. I was scarred somebody enriched as well. And so when Terminator 2 like the big SQL is coming out as like I couldn't wait to see it. So I actually went with my parents and sod and the movie blew me away, you know, not just in terms of visuals, but in terms of the storytelling like the story structured in such a different way that I'd never seen before like you want to talk about, you know blowing Minds wide open like that's what happened to me to the point where R. That was when I first like picked up like one of the one of the movies I think there's a movie magazine called Premier that I used to read. And that's when I started picking up that kind of stuff and looking into what actually went on behind the scenes to bring that to everybody and that's when I realized like I think I think I have some stories. I want to tell I like I want to like make something I want to put it on the screen you were enriched and obviously all this beautiful picture you were engulfed in the magazine.	1.0
1	So what was your plan though?	0.0
2	Oh, I mean I was 12. I didn't have a plan.	0.0
1	You were worried. What's what was your dinner?	-1.0
2	Right but but over, you know over the years that followed, you know, I kept on like I said reading magazines about it. And this is like in the, you know, pretty early days of the internet and IMDb had just come out and so it used to be so okay, even before that. I would go to this video store and they had like a big like movie catalog or not catalog but like an encyclopedia and so like, you know, the first person I went looked up with James Cameron because he's who wrote directed Terminator 2 and so I could find out like it wasn't as easy back then to find out who You know what filmmaker like what movies he done like a complete like, you know filmography, but then, you know IMDb came out and and suddenly I was able to like search for this stuff. It was all just like text back then right? I was about to say IMDb wasn't out yet. You nailed it? Yeah. Yeah. That's our reference. Now. That's that is our dictionaries. We like I probably Search IMDb for piece of trivia. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 10 to 15 times a day easily totally easily and I'm definitely when you're watching a movie, right? Absolutely.	1.0
1	Absolutely like all like I know that guy, where's that guy from about? Oh, is that guy?	1.0
2	Yea, you know that good made this or who wrote who made this? There's like even just today we're looking for something and and as I was like owner who wrote this is a trailer just came out today. I'm like, I wonder who wrote this for a morbius. Okay. He said yeah, it doesn't look very good. But I was curious who wrote it and I went to it and found out that the writer also did the kings of Egypt so I'm pretty sure my feelings about that movie or Justified. I love that movie but is so dumb anyway, so okay in terms of a plan. Yeah. I didn't have one and immediately but as I got a little bit older and start to realize as I started getting to the age where I needed to have a plan being you know, 17 18 years old. I am I going to college am I what am I doing? I like I had I had come to the decision that I wanted to go to film school. But at the same time like I didn't really feel comfortable like trying to ask my parents to help pay to send me to art school. I'm not it for when I'm not even sure that they would have liked agreed to that. You know, I think my dad's a pretty practical person. You probably have been like like well if you're gonna go to you know School Going to pay for it. We want to make sure it's something we can get a return on the investment for which makes sense. But my parents are also very they've always been very supportive of all the creative things I wanted to do when I was a place to play guitar might like my dad. He'll buy me like this. Nice big Marshall Half Stack and let you know it's always very supportive of this stuff. So that's just conjecture on my part. Is that how he would have felt about it? But good now you need to support especially in a different type of you know, you weren't doing sports and things like that.	1.0
1	Right right kind of touch on my side of that later. But yeah that's important right it is and so, you know,	1.0
2	so my dad's answer was join the military never mind about the support.	0.0
1	Yeah.	1.0
2	Well, I mean he's so my dad was in the Air Force also and you know, I think he was kind of a punk kid kind of like I was and I think it was a lot of good for him and I can feel the same way. I was like, I was like, okay like I could join the military, they'll pay for my college and also like it was kind of like not sure if I was ready for college to be completely honest, like I felt like I needed to kind of go out and like see the world and like screw around a little bit. And you know not it's not a very not very popular. I did like not go to college right after high school, but it is if you join the military, I think it's just weird and I definitely would recommend it for anybody and I definitely would recommend a right now, but but it was it was very good for me. You know, I did I joined the Air Force at 17 and I ended up spending about five years in the military honestly because I knew at the other end of that I'd be able to afford to go to film school. Yeah. Well, thank you for your service. No. Thank you for your service. All right, so did it pay? A off do you after you so you yeah, so in the military then now you're going back to films.	1.0
1	Are you going to film school?	0.0
2	Yeah. So yeah. So once I got out of the military I came to Utah my parents live in Utah and it just again not super internet e days and so and I guess I didn't feel very good. It was strange even having been in the military and having gone some of the places that I went, you know, Kuwait and strange places. I still had kind of a problem feeling like I could just go like to LA. And live by myself and go to college they're like, I didn't feel comfortable with that partially because I was married at the time and I know for me I would've been fine being broke sleeping in a gutter going to college in LA, but I was married and so I had somebody else I needed to take into consideration. And so I felt like I couldn't like drag her along to do the same sort of thing. And so the kind of the compromise I think was moving to Utah to Salt Lake where my parents lived and go into the University of Utah has actually had from all from everything. I'd heard a pretty decent little film program moving from Idaho, right? No, so I was in England. Oh God. Yeah. So yeah grew up in Idaho. But then when doing military like left, Idaho and never looked back and and so I was yeah, I was stationed in England for most of the time I was in the in the Air Force and so it's moving back from England back to Utah which I like I did take the short route from Idaho to Utah for sure anyway, but yeah, it kind of took the long way around and so yeah, like I decided I'm like I'm gonna go to film school and you know, like I think Film school is definitely a conversation that could be had another day. Is it worth it? You know, there's a lot there's been a lot of talk about that like, you know, sometimes people say the best film school is just you know doing it, you know, and like I actually don't disagree with that especially in today's world. Yeah, especially today's world is when there's so much online you can read about like there's basically just textbooks online you could you have access to like every movie ever made like you can do a bit of self film school and like equipment like honestly, you know phones, you know, you can grab a phone. It's got a camera on it you can Start you can start doing stuff much easier than you could back when I started in school. There's more content and filmmaking today than there has been ever ever actually seen as such a crowded like this is the stuff I want to do stuff as a kid and like part of me wishes. I was born about 20 years later so I could really taken advantage of all this like at a younger age sure.	1.0
1	We still can but you had some again though, you had to learn kind of the Grassroots and kind of the the harder way. Maybe if you will. Yeah for sure. I don't think there's an easy way but no and I think there's also not one right way to do it true and it because it depends on	1.0
2	And the particular person what works for how you know how I learn is different from maybe how you learn, you know, maybe a classroom setting works better for me. I'm not sure if that's true. But like maybe it does it just depends like and I think again, this is a conversation. I think we could probably do a whole episode on I think Film School versus not filming. We should I think we should too like I found it helpful for me for the most part, but what I didn't learn I learned a lot about story if anything the four years was worth the screenwriting class that I took an incredible teacher named Paul Larsen. And who the guy just the best thing about him? He taught me the one rule of screenwriting like screenwriting doesn't really have rules. There's one rule and of keep it interesting. Yeah, whatever it takes to make that happen. Well, we've that we've made not to jump ahead but we've made three short films together and I think that shows right? Yeah, I think so. I think that's it everything. I feel like I should have like tattooed on my butt or on your butt or is that you know what I mean, like like or on like a written on a wall would probably make a lot more sense or just an arm or just two dozen armed. Yeah or tattooed on my eyeball. It just like I think it's probably the best piece of writing advice I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of writing advice everybody has writing advice but if keep it interesting if you remember that and you look what you're doing, like is this interesting and even if it's just interesting to you, you know, that's that's a start as long as it's interesting in some way shape or form that was kind of the past.	1.0
1	Let's let's kind of talk about present for you now.	0.0
2	Yeah, so I mean, I guess I could start it like the beginning of the present which was like actually having a career in video production and the first real job I got I was still in college when I got it was is hired by a company to do wedding videos and Ari. Yeah, I think anybody that's gone very far in the video production field has probably done wedding videos at one point or another great starting point.	1.0
1	It's a good thing. I'm sorry. It's kind of a joke, but like but it's rough anybody that's really done. It really done that that wedding video Hustle nose and like live it's like shooting like it is the great screwed up the bride and groom kiss, you know, you can't cut you can't have you ever screwed up a wedding video. I have I have not I	1.0
2	Screw up someone wedding, which was a buddy of mine that I shot his wedding Indianapolis.	-1.0
1	It was probably was the second-to-last what and I've shot and I accidentally deleted the mic audio but I had backup audio. I think I just didn't sound as good but I was able to make it work and they couldn't tell but owe you my heart sank.	-1.0
2	The yeah. Anybody does be a production like has had that feeling it's probably another I had shot a wedding and it was the ceremony part of it and shooting on Mini DV back then I think I was on like an Excel like a cannon Excel to sick, right so At the time Blake by far this is the far the coolest and read every child. That was very by far and the I don't know what happened. But the tape was just trashed like I'd put it into like the other capture at real-time weird. Yeah, you gotta play it on TV. You have to walk away. Yeah as it's going through the acts like if it's an hour of Tapley, you have to wait for an hour for to go into the computer. Yeah and like you want to talk about I do not miss that. Oh boy me neither man. So the I mean the biggest sinking feeling in the world is realizing have to Talk to the client and say hey, I lost your wedding. Sorry luckily in this case in this particular case. I was very lucky and and they were actually very very cool. And I think we saw I think we had a second camera but in no audio is like we could see it was sort of Salvage but like not really kind of my me so, okay. So anyway, so after after doing wedding videos, I'll speed this up because actually we are cruising on time the first three minutes of this was was us trying to record. Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point at least three minutes maybe I'm more than that good. Yeah, the first 42 takes so this interesting keep talking to me. So don't mind if I do it's a podcast it probably makes sense.	1.0
1	If I do my man my man.	0.0
2	So yeah when I left winning videos, I went the route of and I'm so I'll just bring up a little bit of a difference in injure and I I have a tendency to stick more with like corporate Jobs versus being a freelancer Drew. You're you're more of a freelance sort of individual. Well, I've been able to	1.0
1	I've gotten I shouldn't say I'm lucky because I say that quite a bit but I've worked hard to get to you work hard you work hard again.	0.0
2	It doesn't stuff like that doesn't just happen to people and don't get me wrong.	-1.0
1	I mean, it's been a rough. It's been a wild ride. You know, I've gone through some corporate gigs, and I've done that whole thing and it just doesn't work out and I find my best creativity. I can Implement my best creativity when I'm on my own and I'm My Own Boss. I've been that way since day one and we'll get into it when I talk about kind of how I started.	-1.0
2	So yeah, so I started a job as a editor for one of the local TV station to CBS affiliate here in sorry. No the ABC affiliate here in Salt Lake and I went to the CBS affiliate here in Salt Lake won an Emmy was some of the with a piece that I did that at some point. I'll put a link out there. So you guys can all see it and at that point I realized I'm like, you know, what I've had enough of news could probably actually also do an entire episode on what it's like working in local TV station. I think we could probably we could probably find a really good guest to come on to talk about any cool. All sorts of people, that'd be interesting. That would be a good one news is a particularly rough filled and so once I had made a five-year plan at that point to once I was in news, I'm like, okay, I'm new to this and it is I'm going to get an Emmy. I'm going to get out and because I knew that Amy could help give me other jobs and it has which it has which was the next job which is doing video production for a marketing company, which is actually where Drew and I met I still work there currently do some freelance as well on the side and thinking about what does the future look like for me? Right? Very cool.	1.0
1	And then yeah when I Stopped working there. I just kind of continued into freelance world. Yeah, so that's that's interesting man.	1.0
2	Oh, thanks man, but I want to hear about you. Like I know most things about you but I feel like there's some stuff like they're in your backstory that yeah find out about and I'm kind of excited about it.	1.0
1	Well, I remember I always say I had this like whole other life before we met I think sorta yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. So the snowboard world that's kind of where we think shaped up, right? So at a young age my grandpa worked for RCA, he actually built TVs and then he also built camcorders, which is really cool. Okay, that's awesome. So he yeah the one I have tattooed on my arm. Is it one he billed as a keystone, but that's the one he filled my Mom's birth with.	1.0
2	Wow. She's really cool. Yeah, that's it. You actually have that camera, right? I do. Yeah, that's so cool.	1.0
1	Yeah, so I do have that Cameron my office but it's cool because so my grandpa always had these really cool RCA like cat, you know Tech and quote or air quotes at the time this was you know, early 90s and he would always fill my brother and I doing like riding bikes and doing these karate shows and magic show that karate shit is a sick. I want to see one of those now you don't and so bad so It was really cool because you know, he would set the camera down and then guess who gets to play with it me true. So yeah, so I was like, I always saw him with a camera and I looked up to him so much man. Like you have no idea how much I looked up to him and he kind of kind of did was that father figure for me for a while and he passed away and no one but anyways besides that he was just he was a very much an influence on my life. So I knew that he was he was successful and and his career in his field. So I kind of saw that and kind of took the leap forward as well.	1.0
2	How old do you think you were? Do you know how old you are? You've like first picked up the camera probably six or seven. Yeah. Yes. I was about the same age my aunt and uncle had like a think is like an old Panasonic least HS camcorder and I was probably, you know, actually probably a little bit as closer to about 10. Yeah.	1.0
1	No the first first camera every shot with it's amazing like and now to see the technology and how it night we write but it was cool because he would always have these and it wasn't much to him for me to take it around. It wasn't like. Oh we just bought that you know it so I just brought that home from work, you know what I mean? So right and it was it was really cool. So I moved in to that he passed away. No. One and and I was really in the snowboard. I still am in the snowboard. I said a word all the time and we had this local little Hill in Indiana where I grew up and my uncle worked there and I was able to always take cameras and these were different cameras at the time. So now we're talking like late 2000s mid-2000 like Sony Handycam exactly TV Sony handycams. I had I had the first Sony Handycam that was the HD 1080p model, but that was kind of like senior year of high school. I don't want to jump too far ahead. But dude, I was the typical. Later kid with a camera, you know, we've all heard that story. You know, I filmed my brother. We filmed each other skating we film snowboarding, but it was cool because I manage the terrain park at this local Hill. I don't call it of ski resort. It was a hill, but we had a kick-ass Park man. It was really cool like we there was huge jumps for how small this place was. We built we would go in and Weld and paint the rails in the summer. So then we would beat they'd be all new for the winter time. But what was cool as we had this part crew and they were all the best Riders from kind of around, Indiana in Northern, Kentucky. Leave it or not. Yeah, there's Northern Kentucky snowboarders.	-1.0
2	And you know the yeah as somebody who's never really been to like the Midwest or south at all like yeah, like the thought of that does kind of surprised me a little bit. Yeah, especially being from Utah now, we have the best snow on Earth that would like the enormous mountains looks like look outside. Yeah, they're right there.	1.0
1	We're ten minutes away from Brighton Solitude Snowbird and and Ulta, you know, we're not have which I take advantage of know you don't but what's cool as is I would film these guys and they film me and we all because we had a photographer. The crew to and we would we would film each other all the time snowboard and doing all these cool tricks and all this stuff and I would make a DVD at the end of the year and then the next the following year. I edit during the summer and the following year. We have an open house and I would actually Premier the the movie that's so cool van. That's really cool with sell these DVDs out of the back of my car van ten bucks a pop. I walked away one time with $200. I knew at that point you could make money from this. I knew at that point. I was like, you know, you don't have to take that easy route you can An actually do something for yourself and I think that's why I'm always in the freelance mindset. Right and I'd you know, you can make money from this just by doing something yourself.	1.0
2	How cool is that that both of us get to do for money something that we love doing. It's like like I bet if you pull people like I would be surprised if 50% of people were doing on a daily basis what they love doing and I know that we're lucky we are lucky and I say that our yeah, we are those who say comes with it comes with being smart though, right?	1.0
1	Because it won't work luck. Only last you so long. You can only hit you can only hit black on roulette for so long until you hit red right? Nice analogy, bro. Thanks, bro. I just went to Vegas last week. I was there you just need to be real know that you know, but I so it was cool though. After that. I and I started going to college I went to school at IU. I didn't move too far away. I owe you that Indiana University and we that was the Campus based on of Bloomington. They had a telecommunications program there. So when I was there, I guess I started in between going to college and high school, but I actually started working with the local photographer. He Is the best in Indiana he still is is Kevin Hudson Hudson photography. He's absolutely amazing, but he taught me a lot of really cool lighting techniques because I was the guy moving his lights around we were using old strobes and things like that and he's cool. Yeah. I think he had like he was using the 5D. I think the time Mark to you know, Mark to Angela. I still have a 5D Mark II. Honestly, it might be a Mark 1 now that I'm talking about it so so in I know he has the 3 and the 4 now, but at the time though, I mean he had the best camera. I would shoot little promo videos for him with my camera. He he really liked the video aspect because he was Leave at ography right and studio photography.	-1.0
2	Okay, as soon as yeah, what kind of so like model photography lots of model photography, which was cool.	1.0
1	But a lot of like senior portraits and family and at the time that's the best that's as good as it got for me because I'm again. This is a small town. This is a small-town Southern Indiana and this guy was teaching me all the stuff that he had learned for 20 years. So I'm taking this and I'm trying to implement this as much as I can on set while with him, but at the same time I'm in a telecommunications program at IU and I'm not I don't feel like I'm learning. Earning anything right now and taking it's a university. So I'm taking these hard math classes finite math and you'll later once I got going in into college kind of my Junior and Senior year. That's when the fun classes started to pick up. So we had like production classes script writing classes script writing like I have kind of a tiff with because my screenwriting teacher unlike yours was actually really rude and yeah, it's a bummer so I kind of have this like little itch, you know with with screenwriting but I'm still working on it.	-1.0
2	Well, it's amazing. It's amazing like just saying that like The Who If you'd had a screen reader to that, you liked who you might be doing more of that if I discourage Any teacher I didn't like maybe I wouldn't be doing it. That's true. It's teachers just shape so much about you. We don't even realize you're right.	1.0
1	So I graduated from IU at the film degree telecommunications The Bachelor of Arts and Sciences, which means nothing to me. It's set in enough folder right and a box here.	1.0
2	So we will have these degrees that were bet would be better place mats. Yeah for the most part.	1.0
1	No, yeah expensive placement, but I would I would eat on it, but I I feel like you have is there like chili stains and Only chilly note for me. Oh, yeah, so so no I so I got this degree and and I you know, and I part of me feels like it was worth it. You know, I don't feel like I learned a ton of production in school, but the experience which I'm still paying for the experience itself was all worth it how to live on your own how to meet people. I met my wife there at school in class like the old school way, which is awesome. Thank you. So I thought at that point, you know, Mike Was to move out here and I was still sponsored in snowboarding. I was writing for a couple different companies. So I'm just going to move out here and figure it out. I don't have a job when I'm moving out here. So my girlfriend the time now my wife we packed up my car. We drove all the way across the United States. Tell Tom how long of a drive is that too long? It was a knife. I think if you do it straight, it's like 26 hours I good.	1.0
2	Yeah, it's pretty that's a long time.	1.0
1	It's ER it's pretty far but we were able to split it up under like three or four nights and we just kind of we like visiting these little museums and the bread make a nigga was fun out of it was and the car that I had like a Scion at the time. I'm and like that thing was just wheelie and all the way on wait a minute. Yeah, did we know that we both had Saiyans at one point? What was it? I had a Scion tC. Yeah, he's black TC. I had a black XP. That's why I don't think I don't think we've ever talked about this. I don't think we have we'll do a whole episode on silent. They don't even make them anymore. Mine was basically a Pepsi can on Wheels is what I kind of thought of it was a hollow a scar Paolo. I liked that. It was a hollow car basically, so now he was cool. So at the time, you know, I moved out Here I didn't have a plan on the way out. I did apply for a job at Backcountry.com and a lot of my friends at the time work there as well. And I was thinking, you know, I'll just apply and I'll work in the call center. You know, right? I'll talk gear. I know gear I ride for companies. This is great yadda. And on the drive out. I actually about six hours away. I got a call and I got the job. He does awesome. So that was really cool. And at the time a job was a job. I was just going to snowboard and I always had film and you know video to you. No lie back on it in case something didn't work out. Which was really really cool. So I don't feel like in school. I learned as much as I could have. Yeah, but I knew once I started going in the right field and working for people that I could keep developing those skills, right? So what was really cool about Backcountry as is I was there for two months and I get an email about job openings via email like internal and one of the jobs was for video and I'm like, okay, they're building out a new video program. This is great. This is this is a big opportunity for me. I apply instantly boom. I don't hear back for a month I hit. Back, I'm like, there's no way I got this but it's worth.	1.0
2	Can I checking up on you know, yeah, that's like that country. Take the kind of taking their time a little bit. Seriously. Yeah. Yeah and I come to find out ya get it got worse for sure.	-1.0
1	But I got the job. That's awesome. So yeah, they built out a whole new studio me and three other guys got hired. We were shooting products. We shot commercials for we shot with athletes. We shot, you know commercials for the North Face. What a great start. It was insane. Yeah. I was I now that's when you talk about luck. That's when I felt lucky and I still disagree though.	1.0
2	I mean, I feel like there's probably a reason they hired you. Something about you. They're like that's kind of the quality we're looking for.	1.0
1	Yeah, and I was think about it.	1.0
2	I was twenty three or four I'm 30. Now.	0.0
1	I was twenty three or four and I was the youngest one on the team the other guys they were hiring were 35, you know, and I was able to move around and they knew I could snowboard so I was able to go out on the slopes and go fast with gimbals and right Gimbels at the time. Yeah.	1.0
2	Well I see and that's it. Such a definite skill. Like that's something I could not do right like I don't ski or snowboard you put me on a snowboard with a camera. I'm going to end up like writing the	1.0
1	Down the hill shot, maybe not but no it was just I did I kind of felt lucky but what was really cool is there was a couple people there that and I still in contact with one, you know, Peter O'Brien. He was really tally shot for a Nitro Circus and he had a lot of cool background and I kind of got under his wing and he was just able to teach me a ton about what we were going to do and the plan I learned about pre-production. I learned it all the things I didn't learn in college. I was able to learn that first job. I got to work one day. Day, they can have the video team are the candle the video team. They were getting rid of product videos. They were going to Outsource. The marketing team wasn't doing well. We were done so cool.	1.0
2	That's my first my first head on the chopping block, you know, I mean again working video production were corporate job. You're going to go through layoffs you want for some reason a lot of people seem to think videos one of the most Expendable parts of a come it is and it's not but is it they think it is right. So that's just the video is expensive to produce it is so a lot of companies look at that a lot of overhead and like that's one of the first things that we're going to cut totally and	1.0
1	Dude, that's the first head on The Chopping Block. Right? Each layoffs was painful. So I did some freelance in the middle there with some with you know, snowboarding companies at the time because that was kind of my only connection at the time, right? So I was able to do some freelance work and then I decided, you know, I need to get more into the industry. So I started working at this really cool place downtown called Redmond movies and stories. It's a Hollywood production rental house. Yeah.	1.0
2	Yeah, we've got the rats remixed the audio for my last movie exactly.	0.0
1	But yeah, and they had a really cool Studio great opportunities there with meeting people. People I had people coming in all the time. That was the first time I got to work on like a large set. I work with like Danny Trejo and I got to get my hands on expensive Hollywood equipment. I think, you know the guys I met there that have been there for a long time in the grip house. They did like Dumb and Dumber and Matilda and The Sandlot all these really cool movies and it was just it was fun to like set around the lunch table and listen to these stories from these grips, you know, and totally and awesome. Yeah again mentoring right so I didn't still think in the back of my head. I didn't learn a lot in college, but now I'm still learning right I was able to take the knowledge from that country. And Redman and apply it to forward I was able to apply forward and keep pushing forward. So I walk in and getting one day get this I'm there for maybe eight months and a show canceled from show time that we were doing a lot of work on remember the show was yes blood and oil. So we were we had just invested I say we but the owner had just invested a lot of money into these huge Airy lights like Sky panel not Sky panels the way bigger than that. They're like do their you could like fit inside of them. They're the biggest Lights I've ever seen they create they create like Son basic, right and he bought three of them and I guess the invested all his money into those. They're still doing great right now. Redmond is basically long story short. That was they didn't have money to pay us anymore. So guess what head on the chopping block number to yank?	1.0
2	Yeah. So okay.	1.0
1	This isn't working. I'm thinking but again I'm able to apply that knowledge that I'm learning those stories from people. I'm kind of starting to know more people in the industry and then I do freelance for probably two years things get a little bit slow and that's when I A call from Dave attics participating Dave mopper. That's what and that's and I actually met Dave at Redmond.	-1.0
2	I yeah, yeah, they've used to Davies to do a lot of work with red menu has a lot of people over there.	1.0
1	There was a it was a co-op in one of the sides and they had their own Production Studio over there. So he was a website designer and we were working on building a new website for Redmond and I was going to film some of the motion clips for it. Okay, that's where I met Dave and Dave actually called me and he asked me to come in and chat about it with this open video position. He basically had he was hiring too. Ooh people his goal was to kind of do like a Red Bull media Style Network because you guys work with some amazing Brands over there.	1.0
2	Yeah, we do. We have done some jobs work with Reebok with the North Face OtterBox like yeah, lots of large Brands and by the way, just to just to throw us in here just so everybody has context for who Dave is Dave ma pert is a very close personal friend of both of ours. But before that he was my boss. He hired me. So at this company, I'll just go into the name is expert boys. I he hired me. An editor there and after about a year or so that's when he made the call to Drew to come in to start expanding our video team, right?	1.0
1	And at the time I only knew Dave right? I didn't know you I didn't know Zack. I didn't know any of the other team members. So that was really cool. So I came in I talked with him, you know, he told me his plan and I got hired as a videographer and then that's when I met you and you were doing all the editing I little remember the first day you started and it was we what we walked up to Harmons to get some lunch is already there's six of us at the time and it was	-1.0
2	it was immediate you and I paired off and talked the entire way up there and I'm pretty sure like, I know I do this is very bromante. But like I Knew by the time we got to Harmons which is like three blocks away. I'm like like this guy's cool. We're gonna have like for sure.	1.0
1	Well that might go, you know, you kind of go into these these corporate positions and he's you know, this uniform style. I shouldn't say like physical uniform but right now this is a certain decorum. Yeah. Yeah and you I got I get a little nervous because you know, and I'm you know slightly I have a hard time trusting these types of that atmosphere should be With good reason yes Oven stuff you've been through but I agree man. I we walked down and we got some lunch and and I was like, yeah, this guy's cool. And you told me you had an Emmy and I was like, this guy's really freaking cool.	-1.0
2	I knew the Army would come in handy.	1.0
1	Yeah making friends with the Enemy exactly. So so we worked there for a while. We did a lot of cool shoots. We work with a lot of Brands like Vega did area which is like Evans and Martin and promark.	1.0
2	Although that was probably one of my favorite videos that we ever did there was cool did today we work with we work with KTM.	1.0
1	We did North Face again we can Stephen we traveled to Canada.	0.0
2	We did I mean we Florida or I mean several times down to like Moab. Oh, yeah, lots of my trips where I mean, we're lucky. We do have a lot of outdoor Brands and so luckily. I have a lot of Outdoors right near us. Yeah, and so we can shoot a lot right around here.	1.0
1	Yeah, but going back to learning. I mean you talk about I mean not only did I learn a lot at that place Dave is one of the most excellent mentors in the world and he is incredible. He is incredible and not only did he help me kind of funnel all of those thoughts and and all of those positions That I've done in the past where I've been editing producing, you know, directing all this crap. I shouldn't say oh crap, you know all these Crepes fine. I'm fine with grab it but I you know all these positions where I was producing directing and editing and running the camera. He helped funnel down, you know your egos Drew. You're a DP he goes, you're so good at lighting. Thank you. Kevin Hudson. You're so good at lighting and you're so good at shooting and I'm like at the time I'm like, yeah. I know. I know dude, whatever like it's fine.	1.0
2	Yeah. I think I pointed. Well, yeah, I pointed at you. I say a speed, you know what I mean?	1.0
1	So and but then we started looking back and he started showing me old footage and he helped me believe that I was that which I really think helped me mentally and kind of give me confidence and put me in the right direction of the position that I wanted to be in. Yeah, so so now I am a DP and I go by being a cinematographer.	1.0
2	Yeah and you are I mean because it Dave did a very similar sort of thing with me kind of helping helping look at who we are and distill down what we might be good at and help you support us in those ways. And by the way, Like we're not going to just you know be all about Dave and never let you hear from him. Dave will probably on here somewhat regularly. I think yeah, he's got a lot of knowledge is good guy. He's fun to talk to he's gonna be our first guest as me first for our first guest. But so I mean, yeah you like you he hoped to still you down into a DP and then the result of that was you start actually D peeing on the short films that we worked on together, right? You know, it was two weeks after I started by two weeks that we did the 48 Hour film project in Salt Lake two weeks after Drew started and we won and we well we won the audience award which I like for me. Okay, I think the most important like I want to hear more about the audience than judges to be completely honest.	1.0
1	Yeah, and I'm not trying to toot our own horn, but it was just a it was a but beat but no I there was just it was a really cool Dynamic of okay. I'm going into this thing and it just happened really fast so fast. So all of that was great for I think I was on the video team there for over a little bit over a year.	1.0
2	Yeah, and again walk into work one day laughs man walk into work.	1.0
1	They had the chopping block ready. It's it's rough. Yeah me and A handful of other people from the marketing team and at that point you're like am I doing something wrong?	-1.0
2	Yeah, and it's not no. No, you didn't do anything wrong.	1.0
1	No, in fact, what was amazing about that layoffs was you know, every way it was sad man. I remember he was you were like ball. Oh it was I was a don't tell everybody I was ride room I waited till I got my car and I kind of you know, I just walked around just leaving Trails of Tears behind me all day long, like slipping on the my best friend just got fired. No, dude it was Cool, because you know why I was back the next day on contract worth making more making more. So this this is where it gets fun because okay third and I'm done with the layoff stories. I don't I have not gone back to a corporate job since then, there's positive things to find about these layoffs for sure.	-1.0
2	It helped put you in the mindset and position that you're in now where you're being I think quite successful what you're doing and you would have gotten there without going through some of these bumps in the road.	1.0
1	Yeah, and but yeah and not only don't even label them as bumps, right because those are again or those learning experiences that I can now apply to my	1.0
2	Absolutely job. So would you need to lay people?	1.0
1	I'm scared to be that guy to be honest just because I've been that position do it. Okay, apparently that guy off. All right, so but what was cool about that is again, I was in there the next day and we I was making more money on a day rate than I was in a week and a half. Yeah, and I then I would come in and we would do pre-production and then I would go and shoots. I was still traveling with you guys. Yeah at that point and they still And in fact in March, I'm going on a diamondback sheet with yeah. Yeah, and and that's you know, it's funny to sit here and talk about it. I laugh but again, I'm kind of it's pretty lucky. That's pretty cool. That's again. It's not lucky.	-1.0
2	I mean if you were a garbage employee and they fired you for being a garbage employee. They wouldn't be asking you back now.	-1.0
1	It's all good. I do freelance under 43 Productions, which is my company. I've been able to get brand affiliations through YouTube and lighter epidemics. On I'm a beta tester for GoPro. I did that a lot in the snowboard industry and now I'm able to apply that into the film industry, which is has been really cool. Yeah, and for the future my long-term goal is just to be a DP on large sets.	1.0
2	Well, you know what man like we're on our way. I mean that brings us to you know, I've talked about me Drew's talked about Drew and now but now it's Drew an errand together like we're doing stuff together and the kind of culmination and where things I think you're leading in the future. We recently last year. We made a movie as a short film called paper cutter I wrote Directed it drew is the DP and and we'll talk about that at a later point, but we're now working on our next one together and I'm pretty sure if everything goes like we want it to Drew and I are going to be making movies together for the rest of our lives. That's the plan. Yeah, hopefully like with or without success hopefully with success. Yeah, but like I think we're always going to be doing it and I think you're you know, we're a team where the Coen brothers and Roger deakins or something like that. Yeah.	0.0
1	I'm the Coen Brothers I guess and this analogy. So that makes a lot of sense this next movie. You want to go ahead and say the title. Yeah, it's called jump seat.	1.0
2	We're going so paper cutter. The last movie was there's plenty of technical about it, but it was kind of ass, like first really getting our hooks into we'd worked on a couple other short films, but this is our first kind of try it like a real movie like something that looks good. So, I mean that feels good something that fills professional and we did I think a pretty good job we learned a lot and that's definitely stuff we can talk about probably throughout This podcast as long as we do it we learned a lot we made mistakes. We did some things right and so we made a lot of mistakes and did some things right. We did a lot of things right and we made some mistakes but we learned from all those mistakes and what we're going to apply to the next movie jump see which we want to be really I wanted to be Top Notch. I wanted to look a hundred percent professional. I wanted to feel I wanted people to be surprised that a couple dudes in Utah made this movie, right?	-1.0
1	And I think we're on the right track for that. And so we're doing a lot of pre-production. Yeah. I was going to say we've started doing Production months ago and we don't even have our shooting dates are in April and April are ejected shooting date and we've already location scout it. I'm so excited for that one. It's uh, it's going to be so much fun. Can I tell him one of the locations for the movie? Yeah. We see that we scouted. Yeah, I do it we're shooting in a old video store. Yeah, and not only does it look like an old video store. It smells like an idiot.	1.0
2	That was like, it's his crappy looking as you remember video stories looking into can it is in the best way possible.	-1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited about that. I think that's I mean just that itself and our lighting perspective. It's got a very dry feel. It's you know, got a very stranger things feel. Yeah. I'm just excited for it.	1.0
2	I think we've already put more time into this in pre-production than we had and paper cutter by far by far well, and I think that's one of the lessons we learned from paper cutter is the best time you can spend is in pre-production that planning doesn't cost very much.	1.0
1	That's true. So I want to I want to wrap this up here soon. But you know, we have our notes here that we've kind of been glancing at we there's a there's a thing at the end of our notes and it says we're different people though.	1.0
2	We are different and you	0.0
1	You say drew is more of a content creator and I'm more of a filmmaker and I want to touch on that because I think what makes you a great filmmaker is you're a really good writer and a good Storyteller.	1.0
2	Oh, thanks man.	1.0
1	You have obviously the visuals and you can see that but you're very good at writing and putting the story together. Whereas I feel like I can kind of come in and help you make that a vision.	1.0
2	Yeah, I think so and I think that's where what like your strong suit is like like you get story like you have all sorts of great ideas and where your story sounds really comes out is in Your visuals like I you know when I give you a signal we're going to shoot and I have the storyboard and I'm like, I think it's going to look something like this like you're interested like okay, where are these characters heads out where they're doing and you shape your lighting and angles and stuff kind of around that like whatever. I might not have already thought about that's where you jump in. You're like, I want to have, you know a dark back here because you know Duality or whatever, you know, and like that's that's a, you know, a huge part of the storytelling as well as well as the place where you Excel that I do pretty much nothing with is, you know, Partnerships with Brands stuff like that you're able to I mean, it's at the moment. We're still working on our funding but at the moment, it seems like the majority of its going to come from you being able to talk to these Brands they like hey, here's how making this movie can help you guys out and exchange for you to give a little bit of money to actually make it. Yeah and like so far it's looking like we're gonna get a bit of money out of that and that's something that I would not be able to like, that's not I'm not I don't really create content for Brands other than it might like my day job, but I don't sell that content to help make it.	1.0
1	Well, I think I think you could I think That kind of comes with me trying to sell my own company to two people at or and these are clients that are different from those brand deals and air quotes So, I think that helps and I and I'm really glad that's that's why I should say, I'm really glad that that we have each other for that and Dave has a you know brings a whole aspect of his talent and I think that's what makes a good team. I'm so used to and I know you were one time shooting weddings, you're so used to being a one-man band. So and I can't stress enough how important it is to have a whole crew with you because there's	1.0
2	Even just from the hands that are on set but the things in pre-production like helping you sell that and getting that money helping you write and make it a good story like taking taking critiques, you know, like you guys all read the script and you guys all have ideas like and it's being having the people around you that can be honest and open with you and say like hey this part stupid. Yeah, and then I say you're stupid. Yeah, and then do you know and then we're doing it my way take your cheeks very well. No. No, I'm just kidding. I think again this could be a huge topic later on is it will be his Taking taking criticism you can take criticism well, and it'll do nothing. But benefit you there. There's I think there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. But again, but yeah having those people around you and all having a team people with different sets of skills. All coming together to figure it out is for me. It's this is a team sport. That's what it's all about. You can do, you know, you can make little videos in your bedroom by yourself.	-1.0
1	Wait, you don't do that because the movies for those No, Sleep puppet shows. Yeah nice, but working with a team.	1.0
2	Stuff will just come out better. I just well, I think you're right.	1.0
1	I think it comes down to being on a team and I think learning from each other which is what this podcast is all about learning from each other and helping teach others. I want to I want to leave it on a piece of advice from you Aaron. Do you have one piece of advice that kind of follows what we've been talking?	0.0
2	Yeah. Absolutely. And I think I should goes really hand-in-hand with we're just talking about with with criticism and the piece of advice I have is get over yourself. Like if you have an ego and you don't listen to what other people say and you don't look at yourself and be Be honest with yourself you're not going to do as well. If you if you can look at something you've done and be like I can do this better instead of like I'm awesome. Everybody bow before me you'll get better because that means you're open and willing to learn that's great.	1.0
1	My piece of advice is we do not fake it till we make it but I do believe we become what we believe we are right on man.	1.0
2	I like that.	1.0
1	Yeah, so so just because you don't have the nicest camera just because you're shooting with an iPhone just because you don't have A lot of lights just because you don't even have another person to make movies with leaving yourself that kind of follows what you're saying don't have an ego and I think you'll be just fine in this production world.	1.0
2	Yeah, like you can't do it unless you start doing it. You have to start doing it.	1.0
1	Yep, and then you'll be doing it just like this podcast is like we said like, hey, let's start doing a podcast. Guess what now? We're doing a podcast.	1.0
