1	Yeah. Okay. I was busy as well.	1.0
2	I was I think we were both streaming.	0.0
1	Yeah, and that's the thing. You know, it's not that like here's a here's my justification. It's not that like we avoid doing the podcast but it's so easy to just keep doing what you're doing. You know, what's what what stays in motion this is what's the phrase the motion of the ocean keeps blowing? Okay, not the phrase I was thinking of is that is the worst quote I've ever heard.	1.0
2	No, it's it was a what's what starts in motion stays in the fleet.	0.0
1	Okay, you're just saying quotes down, but it's just so you know if we're streaming it's just so much easier just to keep Did the fault is it the fault is shared would you agree?	1.0
2	It's about you and I thank you so much Counter-Strike. Yeah, what a good time to be a Counter Strike fear into operation hits the operation comes out today.	1.0
1	And did you did you didn't play it dude? I was at work. Yeah, unfortunately not. I saw you as making game though.	1.0
2	Let me just like rattle off a list of things that God changed. Okay, they buffed the farmers and Galil spray. So the spray is tighter. It's not this different pattern what I didn't know that far. Thomas is $2,000. The glial is $1,800. They're both $200 off on sale special. Whoa, then they added a 16 weeks pass where you can unlock different price tiers kind of like Fortnight the exact same way they set up battle pass in Fortnight, which is just a good system. It's just extra content free cases and stuff like that. Then they added skins for the models in your game. So they added all like different like kind of better looking models to the game. And even though the game's first person they So added a screen at the end that gives you accolades for different things that you did best during the game. So if you had like a highest ATR most headshots or whatever you'll all be on display for your team to see and then they will show you liked what you were actually best at so like utility damage or Flash assists or ADR and then you get there. There's where you get to see the the Skins as well. I'm trying not to reach out right now and then they also added three new cases for new knife skins. Or for new knives with all of the same all the skins and then they added new map to scrimmage mapped as was is just made by like a community mapper. They had a like some Scouts knives math.	1.0
1	They added added so much shit dude it so it's a game perfect now, I mean, it sounds perfect.	1.0
2	Do they Nerf the Creed they they added three hundred dollars to the creek. So it's back to three thousand dollars and it's the exact same so I think that's good though. I think that's really good.	1.0
1	Yeah. It's at least like for the first time like viable, I think people forget.	1.0
2	No be used to buy the Krieg again ever that's it goes to price where people could practice with in real matches and they finally got good with it and put the price back up. So it's still worth buying but now like you don't want it, like people will expect to Krieg nerve to be like you just need to get basically volt this gun put it into a position where no one sees it anymore. Then the game will be fixed. So everyone can use a case. That's not what valve want and they are trying to see if there's a world where you can use both guns situationally it It'll be it'll be a bit better to have a creek but not too much that it ruins the game. Maybe the I think putting the price back up was like in general what most people thought would be a good idea. So yeah. Yeah, so I think I think it's a good idea, but that's sick and then didn't cash.	-1.0
1	Do you imagine cash moving to mmmm as well? Like now cash an official map?	1.0
2	Oh, yeah. Nice. That's cheesy like FM phones up like worried to be like always worried about what what's going to happen with this Maps because I don't think valve communicate that well. With the mappers and people who get their Maps included in the game or anyone for that matter. So I think it's a probably a sigh of relief for him who I'm sure it does a lot of this stuff by himself without even talking about like for example with a simple graffiti that's on cash under Heaven on be site. He did that himself. It's not it's not actually a major a major moment graffiti by Valve. It's a graffiti. He added by himself picking up from from the major.	1.0
1	That's that's crazy. He like I feel like like what an update this is this would you sit like this is like Monumental, right? It's like almost two gigs, which is which is a wild. What's the next update isn't the game perfect.	1.0
2	Now, we've made just thinking like what's the next doesn't like this small thing that was the creek and now it's like sick and they even like added a reason to buy the Galil and Farmers. I think the only thing is the Gloom forms are really sick now like I just played him in mmm where I spent the entirety side only buying khalil's no other Guns and it's $1,800 now sand. It's actually like deals just as good as neikei even better. So so that's a little bit of a problem because it's like $1,000 less. Yeah. I don't know what you do. It's good. Isn't it? Good, right.	1.0
1	I feel like now it's just infrastructure right now. It's like tournaments now. It's like making maybe matchmaking more viable taking the cheaters out. I know that's been a big problem for a while.	1.0
2	Now. I feel like I think it do you agree that the the the there's it feels like there's more cheaters and matchmaking right now. Yeah. Oh for sure.	1.0
1	I don't know what it is. Why don't they come in waves? It must be like hack a launch like they're just like launched a new hack or something and I did together. But yeah right now it feels like it's like a really bad time to matchmake.	-1.0
2	Yeah, it's strange for a while. I trust matchmaking felt pretty stable and like right now it doesn't so, yeah, it's super weird.	1.0
1	Yeah, it does come in waves, but I mean, I hope I mean a lot of people hope that there's like 1:28 tick servers in the next coming, you know.	1.0
2	The next coming up - bye. Mrs. Shaw because 64 tick no honestly. No, I don't either. I don't think I like a lot of the stuff. I learned about movement to make 64 tick interesting like even more interesting like there are certain pixel Ledges and stuff that you can't stand on in 128. You can stand on 64. There's also doors open faster on 64, so I didn't know that aids are all throw differently than be hopping is not worse or better. It's just different right? Yeah. So there's like a lots of things out. Ali really like about 164 tick and when it comes to the shooting, I mean it feels different but not like objectively worse.	-1.0
1	Yeah. No, I think it is worse. I think like the shooting feels worse like coming from like on client to 64. I think you can it's a noticeable different if you play a lot on client, but yeah in terms of movement stuff, I think it's like so my new and I don't think and maybe this is like a contrarian view. I don't think the right move is to move everything to 128 take like, I don't think that's smart. I think it's like right there.	-1.0
2	You know, they don't make enough money to do something.	-1.0
1	No, you know there and it appeals like look at Fortnight. It works because it appeals to like most kidding.	-1.0
2	They do make enough money to do something like that squeak.	1.0
1	No, but they could hold on we do no, no, no, but even just because they can doesn't mean they should like I just feel like they're what do they say most most complain? I have my see those computers that play Counter-Strike may not be able to take advantage of 128 take, you know, like stuff like that that we don't think about Out, you know, I think I think there must their time could be used more effectively. In other areas of the game. Wouldn't you agree?	-1.0
2	Like we have like 20 knives now?	0.0
1	Yeah fuck knives. Can I just I don't care. I don't care about scans are talking about knives. Okay.	1.0
2	Well, some of us aren't broke boys that we can get guys we want. Oh shit test out the new skin.	-1.0
1	No, dude, honestly fuck scans, but what I'm saying is like what if Lana's can I pitch something to you for like an interview? Pretend like you're a Gabe Newell get into character get really into it. Okay what he sounds like. This enables God.	-1.0
2	What are you doing here?	0.0
1	My God, it's the orc from Warcraft that he is incapable still kill. So what did you buy it? Okay, I have an idea. Mr. Mr. Newell. I have an idea. Yeah speak what if there was solo ranks, but also team-based rank in matchmaking so you can have a matchmaking, but I do miss Turner. Keep your pants on no, I'm wouldn't be sick though. I mean then it would be like because the big issue is now like we're we're sort of incentivizing Gamers to play Four frags, but the way to incentivize Gamers to play for actually in roles for teams to win is to reward teams, you know, so if you stick with the core group of five and you have a team ranked right versus an individual rank, it aligns incentives to play better Counter-Strike collectively for	1.0
2	Has individually yeah, they have a team-based and so they have different in every like all other games like League of Legends and DOTA. We have her solo MMR and then you have Team MMR say go don't know why they don't have it.	1.0
1	Yeah, right but been for years but long as it's been an issue for ever like even esea pluggers, like I know like the legendary pluggers and esea that were just so sick and you brought you you and I probably can name off a few but yeah, but what happens is a lot of times those buggers can't perform in a team. If so, specialized their skill and pugs that they're so good at like go mid up every round exactly but we don't want that to happen. We want people to effectively put him to put be put into a roll. So I think that would solve a lot and so that's my idea and I think I fuck it. I'll pitch it then we gave me.	1.0
2	I think the only reason you don't do that in games is if you segregate matchmaking too much then it takes too long to find cues. That's true. I don't know. I don't know if that's a problem for Counter Strike. It's like one of the biggest games right now. We just hit our sixth highest peak. And that's like really high as like 650,000 concurrent players. Oh shit. So after the operation like no like a couple weeks ago. Oh shit for almost no reason which is awesome. So it feels like people are coming back and maybe new people are coming in. And yeah, I mean, there's probably a bunch of people that are like the you know, the more they play and they just started you're going to get hooked. Yeah Counter-Strike. It's a grill you will if you like FPS titles and then you're going to start buying the mouse pads specialized mouse pads with the Stitch edges. Oh rubberized bottom coding with this one side smooth one side speed one side control. You got the guns like mice with the with the you have the light like 90 Graham. Yeah ever G-Force fucking you can't even name wild dude and then you got like I got the keyboard that has blank blank keys. He's gamer mode.	1.0
1	You don't even need to know what you're looking every yeah. Yeah you got gamer do as well.	-1.0
2	And then what you going to do you've invested already at that point $345. I'm not going to just turn around and play some stupid game. That's not going to use all of those things all of those all of your facilities to the maximum capacity and you get the get the monitor. Yeah, you're alone. You're locked in the six consoles.	-1.0
1	Yeah don't like six consoles. You know, it was speaking speaking of stupid games. I don't maximize all of your gamer Hardware you and I have a game in common. Now that we've been playing Star Wars. Okay, Jedi Fallen Masters order, which is crazy dude. I listened. I was a perched atop a rooftop singing my songs about this game before it came out. I was like, oh man, this is gonna be a Souls like game. It's gonna be so good emeralds like show dope squeaks you idiot you Boomer go eat cauliflower within you. Okay. I get it high voice. I'm still waiting for puberty know so but now look at it man. It's so fun. And it's so good dude.	-1.0
2	It's fucking nuts. It's so good. Cause all the cutscenes and the camera the camera eat like the action camera like one of the most underrated aspects like in Smash Bros. Melee, but they made a lot of clones one thing that was brought up. That was like this really kind of salient point from one of my viewers was just that it's the camera secretly that makes the game so much fun. Like it's not it's like it feels like someone's holding it and following you around and that like kind of like that feeling that it's like more lives at helped so much the camera and this game is so good when they switch from cutscenes to like when you're in different environments if it's like rumbly or whatever. It's such a good camera. So smooth always where you need it to be it's never annoying to deal with with and even though there's like a vertical layers to the map. You don't have to like look you don't like look up too hard. Yeah someone it's so it's so well done. It feels like the whole thing feels extremely linear, but then there's so much to explore so I it's just like got everything so far. Yeah. It's only thing that would fuck it up for me is not enough boss fights or Too Short at this point because Titanfall 2 is really short, right?	-1.0
1	Yeah. Well this your it's going to take you about 20 hours or so, I think yeah, I mean Yeah, what's crazy? What about the camera in particular? I remember and you probably remember to in Dark Souls 3 the camera of when they're you're like facing two bosses was always kind of annoying and I was like, well, I don't know how I'd fix it. You know like this is what are you supposed to do if there's to moving objects that you're supposed to keep on the screen. It's kind of impossible to fix but then this game for some reason it doesn't have that same issue. And even though there's like seven or eight enemies on the screen for some reason. I don't think about it. It's almost as if like the game was made with the intention of the camera as well, you know, like as a mechanic versus like making a level making a boss and then having a camera there like that's sort of what Dark Souls kind of fell into but it's true.	1.0
2	Yeah, there's a joke in Dark Souls when you play against nameless King that like the first part with a big dragon that's like considered the camera boss. Yeah fight is basically just making sure you stay stabilized. That's kind of dumb. So, it's cool. Yeah, and yeah, it's the level design. And it's the graphics look so good too. And like I'm not going to play a lot of games. I have good graphics because I'm immediately like so there they spent all their money on this. Yeah, you know, they didn't do something else but was respawn. You know, it's going to look good. It's going to feel good. It's going to have great like probably great voice acting and then also it's going to have a lot of depth in terms of like the variety of things that you do like sometimes for a very good with vehicles. Like the things that you ride or the ice sliding thing and while running your in the what the what's like the big like garbage truck looking thing that you drive sometimes what garbage truck?	1.0
1	I'm so offended.	-1.0
2	I'm just biting my mean it's like that a giant tractor fucking with an 80 80.	-1.0
1	Yeah, AT&T you like my mom trying to relate to me.	0.0
2	Okay. Yeah, like even that just like really cool fun that fun. Do and they have to practice with Titanfall 2 to track area.	1.0
1	It's a tractor. No, but like the big the core of this game. This is what was so important and what I was scared of which I think is easy to fall into for a game like this is that it takes itself. So seriously, and it doesn't have the gameplay to support it. Do you know what I mean? Like here? I can't tell what's more interesting like the graphics and everything going on or the gameplay? Because if you just have Graphics it's like just eating whipped cream, you know versus like having the gameplay behind it. There's like A cake there that's enjoyable to yeah, you know what? I mean? It's like you need cake you need cake before you put on the process might like to I don't know too sweet. I couldn't think of another example. Okay. How about this? Let's rewind rewind rewind it's like having a chassis of a car but no engine, you know, like a lot of games fall into this, you know where it looks really nice and I just like Wolfenstein falls into this. I think a lot of other games I can't think of but like games like Wolfenstein basically they look so nice and they have like really cool vibe to it. But then underneath the gameplay gets repetitive and is boring but it seems like with respawn there. They always put mechanics and gameplay first and then everything is periphery which adds to it.	-1.0
2	Like if the graphics were just near the periphery shit the periphery that all looks sick.	-1.0
1	It looks so good. It's it adds to it. You know it like even if Graphics were shittier launders, I would still enjoy	1.0
2	Boomer rhetoric by the way, what do you mean Vibe and said why how's it surviving man is Cool vibe?	0.0
1	Not a sick thing to say.	-1.0
2	We're trying to include chat now, so people will be incentivized to come to the live stream at twitch.tv slash lunders second plug podcast.	0.0
1	We're already there Swiss dot TV.	0.0
2	/ laundry's.	0.0
1	Yeah. Well, I'm gonna beat this game and I hope you do too unlike Secura, which I won't bring up. But here we are.	1.0
2	Get more than secular. Oh, what do you like it?	1.0
1	Where the second row if it wasn't Star Wars that is a hard question that takes a lot of introspection.	0.0
2	Yeah. Well, this is a whole. How much do you like the story? Where what is the story? Where is this story in like inside of Star Wars?	1.0
1	Where is it or like what time so this takes place after episode 3 in before episode 4. So this is I won't spoil anything anyone is listening. But this takes place after Order 66 where all of the Sith are all of the Empire basically. Is and kills all the Jedi all the Younglings if you remember all the kids and everything and so now you are the main character Cal who survived Order 66 and so you're one of the last remaining Jedi or so you think is it Order 66 like a GU leg or something. Nice. Yeah order 66 was like a bad guy said hey Execute Order 66 and all of these army men are all these Troopers clone troopers. Has ended up killing all the Jedi, you know, so like unexpectedly like a betrayal. That's basically Order 66.	-1.0
2	Okay. Well, I killed like hundreds of Clone Troopers so far.	1.0
1	So he'll everyone else died like a little genocide you got going on there. Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
2	Well Clone Trooper is are very this pork Hood Troopers are very self-deprecating with her humor. Yeah, are they like that in the movies and stuff, too?	-1.0
1	Or what? Well, it's like the movies are super just like Blue Collar guys. Yeah, they are. That's why I like in some ways like the Jedi are kind of fucked up for killing these guys, you know, these guys are just going to work. They're just doing their shit, you know, yeah, you know, they okay. What's the big deal? They're trying to put order in government and Jedi are these radical fanatic religious zealots trying to take over the world using saying things like what stands in the way becomes the way, you know, using philosophy. Yeah. It's almost like you could take the Yoda thing.	1.0
2	Thing. Oh speaking of Yoda. I saw a baby Yoda in the Mandalorian.	0.0
1	Yeah, very cute. Yeah, such a cute. I know it's like the best part of the whole show. That's another. Oh my God, I forgot we watch the Mandalorian to dude.	1.0
2	Yeah, I did it. Oh, that's a spoiler. That's okay, dude. I forgot.	1.0
1	Yeah, that's why I it's fine. Well, you're wrong. I mean you're kind of wrong about that.	1.0
2	Anyway, it's a yodel. It was there like a girl Yoda. I saw this on some.	0.0
1	Yeah, it's stupid We Don't Belong talking about yodel. It's not a spoiler.	-1.0
2	Okay, it's not as though I don't know. We don't know what the gender is.	1.0
1	Okay, so it's not a tailor specialty mean. It's like a weird and two different species. Okay. What do you think of the manual? Okay. So this is an interesting take because launders has no experience with Star Wars and some would even say he's like dumb as hell just get me. And me and intellectual know that it's true. I'm super into Star Wars. I'm very curious about your take for someone who doesn't who's not like a complete nerd.	1.0
2	I watched that when I watch that first episode. I didn't like it at all. Really. Yeah. I like them. I like to second episode. I may be getting used to stuff there are some stuff so I actually kind of had a question. So this happens in a lot of movies not just Star Wars but where if they put on like big bulky suits The shirt and they they have objects like they're handing coins across the counter that are like larger than normal. They don't look like they have the correct weight. Like I know they might be on another planet may be different gravity. But do you know what I'm talking about? Like when he's climbing on the giant tractor and they're throwing shit at him the Wookiees are ya they and it doesn't feel like they're those blocks and stuff are the right weight. So feels like looks not Dido cheap corny. I don't know how to put it put it but doesn't look realistic.	-1.0
1	You're great. Keep it together. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard. That's that's where you're drawing the boundaries of the about the fact that their hurtling through space and freezing apartment of might be different maybe SP gravity's like 400, but then it seems like the gravity for other occasions like when he's running does it look like it looks like it's the same gravity as Earth. Okay. So let me let me address this from not a physics. We're not going to talk about Gravity of planets like that has some factor into it. Like it's like different different races to so like there's there's like so you're talking about the main character the Mandalorian the guy on his armor. So like 'hey, so the lure is that he mandalorians never take off their armor basically like so he's used to that so he's probably like pretty strong, you know,	1.0
2	and so no not as he looks fine is he's fine. It was like the objects that he was interact or other seeing where it's the objects that other people are interacting with or that were like being used on him and stuff is so like Jawas.	1.0
1	Oh you're saying the jaw was not the Wookiees.	0.0
2	They said something about like look, he's right language or something. Do they speak the same language? No. No, not at all. That's okay Jawan. He's a little racist.	-1.0
1	No, I don't know what they should meet. They just speak something else. I'm not sure what it's called.	-1.0
2	When he's is probably not he said something about their language. He's like you don't speak good job.	-1.0
1	Yeah, you don't speak ja you don't speak good Jawa Jawan. He's no I they do. I guess that's fair. I mean, it's just supposed to be a little silly. You know, it's supposed to look corny in certain scenes, but the vibe of it is so damn it, but the aesthetic of the the show is so like it's way darker than I thought it would be you know for like a she's there's no Star Wars.	-1.0
2	Terms of mood I'm not trying to be an asshole so know you're getting genuine. All right, like Society lie so that I feels like the at some point it felt like you're watching like the first first episodes like nice and slow in your they kind of there's not a lot of talking which is I appreciate they do a lot of kind of establishing shots and they really let you kind of try to understand the Mandalorian without showing to just over facing on the personality front and just like shoving it down your throat, which I think was also Next vacuum Patients Out of the viewers, but then at the same time there was like so many kind of like corny Parts where it felt like you're kind of you're constantly flipping in and out of the moment of it being very serious to being light-hearted and I genuinely could not tell if it was like a show for people who are young or show for people who are older.	-1.0
1	That's totally that's that's a good I think that's fair because I felt the same thing like there are certain things that stuck out to me, especially in the first episode like remember that blue guy. Why none of that blue guy in the first episode he was so out of place in my eyes. Like he he totally like totally didn't fit the show because like the Mandalorian at it's very core. It seems to me like it's like a space Western, you know, and it's like everyone's grittier and it is cheesy in some parts like the I have spoken guy, but it's still totally relevant. But the blue guy to me in the first episode stuck out like a sore thumb like he he broke the tone for me. That's when I was like, oh this might Bad show so I share the sentiment but I think okay overarching lie like the show is darker grittier, but it still has that like that Star Wars cheese in it though. It's like the character like the hard thing is now to make the Mandalorian an empathetic character because he's not taking off his helmet. I think that's going to be really interesting.	1.0
2	I thought it was he's never going to take it off. I'm not sure if he doesn't they don't take off their armor.	-1.0
1	Yeah. It's like their religion.	1.0
2	Yeah. So yeah, he's like guns or religion to me. And he's like all these specific things that he couldn't do. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I wasn't sure how cool he was. I felt like they're trying to do like kind of like a drive Vibe Ryan Gosling for Drive type 5, which I liked but then that's the vibe that if anything goes wrong, he's definitely capable of fixing it, even though he gets really fucked up. Yeah, but I right he's been he's been like Daddy by a couple of characters who are either smarter than him or whatever. Hmm. So but I guess you know, I got to have like that humanizing element as you watch him kind of learned sure.	1.0
1	Super bot in man. I think the director Jon Favreau who's just incredible. He's so talented. It's he done. He did Chef remember having seen that some a lot of shit man. He's really really talented and then Dave filoni he did. He basically did all the cartoons for Star Wars which was really dope. And so it's like edit strikes that Vibe too. So I'm super excited. Let's keep watching it. There's only eight episodes 30 40 minutes. It's I think it's super worth it and Disney plus Rock so I'm a big hill.	1.0
2	I'm shocked at how many people got Disney plus. How is Disney owns a wig another guy color coming full circle on the subscription thing and then people are going to start picking like what subscriptions they were going to stop for the fact that like another one was better or that was one other one had enough no now it does knees at but Disney owns everything Man Marvel.	-1.0
1	They own like Pixar. They own National Geographic.	0.0
2	That's A cool but like ones that's why would you pay for National Geographic? It's a weird thing to pay for. I feel like I guess I don't know my dad would stand around and watch National Geographic on TV all day or whatever but like and like once I everyone seen every fucking Pixar movie and then you're going to watch the new one theater is and then like well, maybe that's you I think people have kids and stuff to you know, I think most people you have Disney plus.	1.0
1	Oh, yeah, I guess that's true. I don't know why I'm sticking up for the parents. We have kids longer. Okay shit. I just leaked my kid. No stay over there.	1.0
2	I need on get away.	0.0
1	Daddy's doing his work. No.	-1.0
2	No, I mean I like so there's some good Disney shit out there man, like even for adult Marvel movies are trash and then you get so you do get and like a Disney movies like you've seen them already so I don't really So for a subscription service little weird to me, but unless they have countering the sorry guys original shows.	-1.0
1	Yeah, they will like the Mandalorian but what about Netflix? Fuck Netflix? What's on Netflix? That's good.	1.0
2	I don't know is that just has like it's like a nice blanket for all the older shows. Like I re-watched.	-1.0
1	The office on the office is leaving Netflix now to now they're going to do the product like everything that's good is leaving Netflix.	-1.0
2	Okay there take they left.	1.0
1	Yeah, they're going to edit. I just like don't think of it any good show on Netflix now.	1.0
2	So like if you can you want like a general blanket just like service even if you have Amazon Prime, which if you guys have Amazon Prime do not feel like you think that means It's like a horrible watch you can watch like Amazon video for free. Yeah, it has a lot of shit to and then you're going to get Disney plus 2. Yeah, I don't know how else you have anything else.	1.0
1	I think it's the bubble launders. I found it.	0.0
2	I have HBO besides didn't HBO's one thing I would get some a fucking HBO slut. I love H. AI love each leg Yeah, so I would do that because that's like they have so many shows that are there. Is that are all good.	1.0
1	Yeah, and they have a small.	1.0
2	All quantity, but they have like such good quality is my thing to go watch stuff that I've said I've seen but just like covers like a big, you know vast array of things.	1.0
1	Yeah. That's fair. I don't know. You know what long as I think I found the bubble.	1.0
2	Okay. I think we're in a constantly found the bubble.	1.0
1	I think we're in a Content bubble. Because content bubble. Yeah, because people's Leisure Time Has stayed the same if not minimize. Like if not over time has become less and less like people's time to watch entertainment. But the more content that's being produced there less time like people like me have to consume it. So then we have to make choices like there's some good content that I won't watch. So at some point with all these Services coming in we're going to lose like the ability to even in participate or watch like great great shows so that much that's money lost. You know. Yeah that's sort of a and I choose and now for some reason I choose to consume less like easily accessible content over excellent content, you know, like instead of watching like Better Call Saul I'm going to instead opt for like a twitch stream because it's so accessible.	1.0
2	Whoa, I don't I don't though. I wouldn't really like I watch you have introduced Game of Thrones. Homie, you have to allocate time though. I like I like I watched shows on the plane. Like I told you don't watch them at home. Yeah, I'll watch some on the plane. So I'll do all of the show watching. So then yeah because if I wasn't if I didn't have that part where I could just say, like I'll have like a tattle I can say I'll have like 20 hours a month on a plane. So there I can just put all my show time. They're not waste any of my other time. So that but if I didn't do that then yeah, I probably wouldn't watch a lot of shows.	-1.0
1	Yeah. See you. I mean you did a roundabout lay we went to loop the loop to get to go back here.	1.0
2	And that's why I locating time has been a yeah. It's just gets more and more challenging. That's true. That's what I think.	1.0
1	That's it's crazy that twitch streams can compete with that stuff. I wouldn't think that you know that people opt to watch lower effort.	-1.0
2	What is this thing about liveness that you just can't look away. It's crazy.	-1.0
1	There's this really good book out there called present shocked by Douglas book.	1.0
2	On how to become a better streamer what my God, I'm not hard.	-1.0
1	There's a there's this book and it's basically like he talks about the value of live like of like sub like, it's not just live it's live and you are part of the content as a viewer. I think that's something really unique that only exist but we had on screen.	1.0
2	That's what you're saying.	0.0
1	Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying like that's that's a few and look at TV Dude TV. Is also like all these Netflix deals that are all these twitch deals that you can stream certain shows on Amazon. That's like the next level because people want to be the content, you know, and I think just viewing the content isn't enough for our brains now just passively watching something you everyone wants to participate in it and Twitches like gaming is the ultimate medium. That's right because it's like a sub entertainment now, you know, it's like weird. It's like you it's chat is responsible for Providing a good stream in some ways. You know, it's like hey, it's a very strange phenomenon was he just did he talk about Twitch in that book or know? So I mean he taught he basically it's a really good book. I suggest everyone reads it but he basically talked about the emergence of like modern entertainment and the sense of like The Simpsons being the one to break the ground basically completely breaking the fourth wall inviting people to participate almost in the sense of like like this is ironic. I'm going to make fun of things in a very ironic way and You know it as an advice like as someone who's smart and pays attention like you can participate in that because only you understand this for reference. And then in the same same stance like Twitches in the live entertainment is the same way like you can under you are able to watch this at this present moment and can participate in it. So he's saying that basically his product prediction is that people will get more and more involved in the content that they consume until it becomes extremely homogeneous, you know. Yeah, it like breaks down the relationship of An audience number until everyone is up on the podium together. You know.	1.0
2	Whoa, that's why reality TV works. So well write exactly because it's like you're selling you're selling and active participation on things that people are questioning people like they want to just they want to sit there and fucking starfish and just watch it and just like consumed while they're really bored. I do they some is lots of passive participants in streams to write a cherry majority of viewers aren't talking and chatted and anystream.	1.0
1	Oh absolutely, but chat is still participating like like like forsen is chat. I'll give you an example forces chats amazing because because you know, they are they are so part of the stream like imagine watching for some without chat, you know, like it's like totally missing part of the experience even if it's so boring, but right I mean what am I right? It would be boring. I mean, I'd like to say it would be boring.	1.0
2	But okay better example because force is actually a pretty funny but like yeah period you would never even think he would have a lot of viewers. Right way, you would think that but he's not meanwhile, he's got 20,000 audience crazy spam in the the craziest shit.	1.0
1	It's amazing. But even then even in those encrypt periods chat. I'm not participating but chat representing my view, you know, like there's almost like this we're owner Ali connected and saying the same thing and it's like that's why I love like the streamer and shat relationship. I think it's so unique and funny because it's like we're all supposed to pretend like we have equal. We're on equal footing even though we're all watching One Loser on camera, you know, like it's funny like it should be a there should be some sort of relationship and the best dreamers that I see like xqc and everyone know how to use chat in that way.	1.0
2	Oh my God, they're so funny.	1.0
1	Excuse me is this is such a good streamer. He's so good but he uses chat like chats a tool for him. It's not a side thing. It's like this chat. He plays with chat strings like Clint Stevens. Other one, he knows what to say to get the reaction like that's like barely puts in any energy and he just is so relaxed and it's so fun to watch.	1.0
2	Yeah. Well Clint dude. Yeah me too.	1.0
1	Fuk sick console six.	-1.0
2	Danzo's the timing on that. The delivery was just purchase pristine. It was me.	1.0
1	It's so good and he's like, he always streaming. It's just wild to me that he's not just insanely exhausted like	1.0
2	all the tire right? He's got it. He's kind of got everything figured out to the point that he's not even too far off of himself. He just having a little fun, you know probably isn't trying that hard. He just kind of has everybody invested in his product as opposed to trying to figure out what everyone wants to see exactly but I have a feeling launders at all.	1.0
1	These really good streamers. They're super introspective. Like they probably are crazy. I don't want to say insecure in a bad way but introspective maybe they're probably insanely introspective on what works and what doesn't	1.0
2	You know and I'm sure over the years could it be an accident right unless you were a meme and then you would and that way everyone would know you were an idiot sure be different.	-1.0
1	No, and I know there's obviously like luck involved.	-1.0
2	But I think these a lot of these dreamers are just like very talented and they can't Point their finger on what that Talent is, but they have it, you know, they have whatever it could but I mean if they did it themselves, like what if you were their friend you might know more about them than the viewers do sure is like a might just kind of just like you want to pull the Veil Down if you were that streamer. It weird when you even have that conversation with people in the middle of your highly entertaining stream. It doesn't make sense. Hey, this is why we love having that conversation.	1.0
1	You know sure yeah, it's like it's like kayfabe in wrestling but it's like everyone knows it's fake but we choose to think it's real because it's more entertaining that's like exactly what streaming is like, right? Yeah. It's true. You know, it's like it's a show it's like you're putting on a performance as chat and the streamers putting on a performance, you know, knowing that nothing really matters and this, you know, That's true. That's so sick. It's really cool. That's why I like about twitch.	1.0
2	You know, it's just nice. That's like a really kind of like that's like a kind of very cordial handshake right where it is. Yeah. Everyone was just trying to have fun. That's what that is the point of the game, you know, when people I do like when people are like they know sometimes it goes too far with like I ice beside ins streams and stuff like that, but when people are like, oh it's content its content like everybody is so aware. Yeah what that is almost sickening but like at least it's better than people not being aware and buying into Something that they don't understand it's kind of cool that if you'd like people are I remember like when he's first started it like watching YouTube your favorite YouTubers couldn't have a fucking sponsor without everyone calling them fucking sellouts or Yeah by trying to dissuade them. Tell them they're unsubscribe and shit like that. And now people understand the plights of the guys were probably make it like millions of dollars more than like their parents do they'll be like no he's just got to do this right? He's just this is important. How is he going to make a living if he doesn't take on a Sir, we have to be supportive like all that stuff. That's the kind of rhetoric. You didn't hear from the average fan or viewer for like 10 or 15 years ago.	1.0
1	I agree and I think that comes with positives and negatives but I think the positives outweigh the negatives where it's like fuck you and also fuck you too, but it's kind of funny, you know like that, you know, because that's a thing. I feel like this is gonna sound like very Boomer talk, but I feel like the actual Baby Boomers don't understand that about the internet, you know, like the actual baby boomers are like, oh my God. Russia and oh my God, like these huge issues on the internet but like YouTube is consuming my kids days and nights, you know, but the kids know it's like a big meme, you know, and nothing is really serious and it's like an inside joke with the kids who know something that the adults don't don't you explain it to them.	1.0
2	They're going to just think that you're really stupid exactly.	-1.0
1	So I love that about like twitch and YouTube. It's like everyone who knows knows and if you don't you're just a boomer like an actual Boomer like not even the meme. You know, yeah, that's it. So safe.	1.0
2	I think it's great to have the word because it does it does it does explain people a lot better than many other words. So I think I'm happy for the word Boomer.	1.0
1	I love that. It's like you've come to that conclusion, even though you're been so sensitive about being called a boomer in the last episode. It's been a month. He literally quit the podcast.	1.0
2	This is not because I wanted this to be stopped being called a boomer. That's not why I quit the podcast. Oh, yes.	-1.0

Hey guys, really love the podcast a ton. The only thing that would make me love it more is if I could listen to it while wearing boxers slides really enjoy both of your guys content and personalities and the podcast is always really funny. The only thing that could be improved upon. Oh is if launders would finally give white cloth a chance and stop with his blind hatred of such a delicious drink Lacroix is also good, especially the tall Earth in cans with the to flavor. Did you just write the second would be angrier about his opinions? If you didn't have such a great bull cut all of you including Nathan because he needs more love.
