4	Hello. We're talking to Nicole Anderson today. She is a fellow YouTuber her channel is called taboo topics. She also has a website of the same name called taboo topics.com and her motto is challenging tradition changing Minds choosing happiness. Nicole was a Christian for 10 years and just recently It came out as an atheist very bravely and publicly on her channel. So you still have a bunch of Christian friends. I presume.	1.0
2	Yeah, it's so funny reading some of the comments on my YouTube channel because they're all like saying that I'm running around is like an atheist circle now and it's the actually like complete opposite of that. Like I still have all of my same friends from Junior High and high school and they are like all Christians and I'm kind of the only one that left. left which is kind of what has been so hard about this whole journey is just being like, you know the odd one out and it's just interesting to see like how his like I totally understand like not all Christians at the same and people are like don't just let like a few bad apples like ruin your experience, but I'm like guys like I love my friends like I know that they're not like bad people but I'm just sit like my whole thing is that sometimes the things that they Believe and do and say because of that can be hurtful and I don't think people realize that you know, and I've just like experienced a lot of that with my very conservative Evangelical fundamentalist fundamentalist friends.	1.0
4	You know, yeah, you have the conservative fundamentalist friends in particular because I have Christian friends, but I tend to only steer towards the ones that don't drive me insane.	-1.0
2	Yeah, it was crazy. Well like my whole experience with Christianity stemmed from my friend group. Like I wasn't raised a Christian I was raised and like just a very loving secular home and religion wasn't talked about and so, you know actually like First experience with Christianity happened when I was 12 years old. I was in my seventh grade science class and we were learning about Evolution exempt these two girls got so mad and they were like, what about Adam and Eve? What about the Garden of Eden? Like how can you be teaching this stuff in a public school? Like they were so mad and I was like, who are you talking about? Like who's Adam? Who is Eve? Like I didn't I was so ignorant. Ignorant and so I think at that point I kind of like became their salvation project and I was starting from like a blank slate like I didn't know anything about religion really and so I kind of just accepted that what they were saying was true and my parents never wanted to tell me like what to believe or what not to believe but that kind of lead to like an unhealthy. Like one-sided argument that was like filling my brain coming from my friends and I didn't like I don't know. I didn't necessarily critically think too much about it.	-1.0
4	I was only 12 and I just remember that's when it happened for me to 12. Yeah. Yeah because I used to be a casual Roman Catholic. Very passionate about God though. I always really felt I always talk about these like bedside moments that I had when I I was a little girl and I really felt a connection to the spiritual and to the Beyond. Yeah, and it wasn't until I was 12 that I went to this Born Again Church. That was Evangelical and you know now looking back I believe that's when I got really messed up and some really toxic thinking and toxic beliefs and fear fear fear fear.	1.0
2	Yeah, you know that might have been what it was because I was never around like a liberal Christians. It was the very extreme. Evangelical fundamentalist and I didn't know that that was like a small sect of Christianity like even recently I just thought that that was normal Christianity and I was like, you know always made to feel like, you know, any type of disagreement was just you're not being a real Christian. You're not being a good Christian. But yeah from the very beginning it was just like this constant theme of Of like you think your life is good now, but it can be so much better like is if you believe in Jesus like you will be like infinitely better. And yeah, it's funny like you mentioned the bedside moments because I still like so vividly remember sitting in my bed one morning when I was 12, and I was praying to God and attempting to repent for my sins, but I just kept saying Did I didn't know what I had done wrong? Like I didn't understand why I was so unworthy and undeserving of his love. I didn't like feel like I was the sinful person that was filled with like the innate evil of Adam and Eve like that. They let into this world. But like that's what I was reading. And that's what I believe like it was the inspired word of God. I thought it was true and all the worship songs in youth group and stuff just kept saying like I want more of you God and less of me and it just kind of like shrunk. I'd like shrunk myself down and felt like I must have been doing something wrong in his eyes and like for that I was truly sorry and you know begged for his forgiveness. And I don't know it was just like this constant theme of know your place like you are inferior by Design and I didn't realize it back then but that was like when my healthy amount of self-worth started to Chip Away And it was like crazy that that was like the moment that I dedicated my life to Christ. Yeah, and then like for 10 years after that Christianity kind of consumed my life my friend group. We would have liked deep discussions all the time. I would go to youth group devotional groups summer school, like summer camps Bible studies. I was a youth leader for a while. And it was just a very like simple Faith but I was always told that you're not supposed to intellectualize your face or critically think too much about it. And I kind of feel like not teaching apologetics is like doing a disservice to your congregation because you know people might hear about these things eventually and then I mean that's like what happened to me in my last semester of college after You know, I was 22 so it had been 10 years. My roommate was a religious studies minor and she was doing all of this research for her classes. And you know, she was having like people that were on the committee of translating the ancient Greek manuscripts like as her teacher and they were telling her these things that I just knew nothing about and it was that same sort of feeling I had when I was 12, it was like wow, like I'm so ignorant like there's so much more. I need to know. And so I that's when I like started my deep study of Theology and I went into it as a Christian wanting to be a better Christian thinking that I was going to like, you know be so solid in my faith and then just as I continue down that path like things slowly started to like not make sense with like the Christian doctrine and my faith was like unraveling I guess in my questions. We're too hard and Too Deep for the Christians around me to answer I guess so I was kind of on my own and I yeah, I decided that like I just didn't think the facts were there. But honestly the damaging part came like after I left like once I just decided I don't think this is true. I don't think I'm going to call myself a Christian anymore. That's when I started like feeling the damaging effects of like what? It happened like the past 10 years, basically.	-1.0
4	What is that? What is that look like or feel like to leave and then get that reaction.	0.0
2	I mean there were so many different aspects of it. You know, one of the aspects was this idea. Like I started viewing Christianity differently and I know a lot of Christians will probably disagree with this interpretation, which is totally fine. I just think it's important to realize that there are a lot of people out there. There who will hear the gospel message and they'll interpret it in kind of the way that I started seeing it and it's not necessarily always healthy because I remember looking back and you know asking myself like why I could never bring myself to get baptized even though so many people encouraged me to do it and I think part of me subconsciously disagreed with this idea of like dying to yourself like this. Idea that you are your intrinsic self needed to die that there wasn't anything like good about you. Unless God was living in you and you were reborn as Christ and it just seemed so hurtful to me and like looking back now. I don't think I ever felt broken enough to need a savior. My self-image wasn't bad enough like my life wasn't shattered enough for me to view myself. Business like dirty rags that God Compares artworks to in the Bible and this just kind of made me see how religion doesn't work as well. If you start out with a healthy amount of self-worth because then when I was going through harder times in life, I remember thinking how easy it would be to like go back to church and to feel better and you know, there would be so many people who would instantly care about And it give me attention and support and comfort me and try to make me feel better. And that was so appealing but it made me realize how this idea of God and religion could so easily be used as a Band-Aid like for our problems. It made me feel like religion was like preying on the weak and in those vulnerable moments, like it's so easy to want a savior, but I needed to like pull myself back into reality and be like Intellectually, though. This doesn't add up in my head. So like I don't know. I didn't want to take the easy way out and just like go back and then oh gosh, like there's just so much of out of this is how I felt but it's like you're not capable of anything without God and everything good is because of him and everything bad is because of you and like he deserves all the glory and you're just a vessel completely worthless without him and Like if you leave God your life will be miserable. And that's what I was always told and that's I think what really hurt me afterwards like when I was like, I don't believe this anymore like but people are still telling me like he needs to be the priority in your life. And like if he's not bad things will happen to you and like yeah this one time. Yeah like this one time my friend. I was telling her that I had filled out this job application and it was a writing application. So I had to write like a ton of like not essays but like a lot of prompts and then I hit submit and my internet had gone out and it got all deleted and instead of just being like yeah, that sucks like, you know the internet but she was like wow God is really trying to get you back and in my head I'm like God is going out of his way to like make my life miserable so that all come back to him like that doesn't make any sense. Like, how do you I don't know how can you think that way because that just sounded like manipulation.	-1.0
4	It's all so yeah, I mean There are so many levels of toxicity with that because you know, that was a huge part of my life really imploded. I started being you know, you and I have this in common where we both had a breakthrough moment where we became very explorative and intellectual and curious about our religion. I left it as well. I didn't I would always say like I was never capable of leaving God or feeling disconnected from my virtual side, but I had to leave the actual building of the church because these things just weren't resonating anymore. And when you're surrounded by people that say every bad thing in your life is happening because of what you're doing wrong. It creates is never ending anxiety and and it's just not true.	-1.0
3	Hi beautiful people when I began this podcast. I was completely lost on where to begin. Thankfully.

So you don't have to figure all that out. So if you have a podcast idea just download the free anchor app or go to Anchor dot f m-- to get started. I can't wait to hear your podcast.	1.0
4	Like if I walked outside right now and walked my dog and he got hit by a car or something like really I'm supposed to go back to my house and Trace back. What a terrible person. I've been when like all I do is try to like give my love to my friends and work really hard and do my best in life.	-1.0
2	But I remember the Christian mentality of everything that happens is because something I did or it was like the devil like creeped in because you weren't like having a Off of that Armor of God around you to protect yourself.	-1.0
4	Yeah, and I think it's also incredibly disenchanting and a huge part of my audience is you know, there are atheists that are genuine atheists and there are quote unquote atheists that are just really hurt Christians and I see both and I don't you know, I don't say they're always one or the other but that does exist and the reason is because also we're told that every good good thing happens because we're involved in church and because we're being perfect and we're saving ourselves and we're honoring our husband and we're listening to our leaders and tithing and when you're doing all that and you're in a sexless marriage or in my case, like you find out your husband was cheating on you and it rocks your world like then all of a sudden you're like wait all of these things that were supposed to protect me that I have been doing right, you know, like I used to Like the girl to find girls and that's why I harp on them so much for anyone listening. That doesn't know Nicole and I are both YouTubers. So there's this whole life Christian space of YouTube, which is very Niche but it's so funny thing always get recommended to me too.	-1.0
2	I'm like YouTube is crazy like why I recommend you all these videos to me.	-1.0
4	But yeah, but um, these two girls are you know, like I have no hatred for them at all. It just breaks my heart that there for me still. So giving a lot of toxic information that has been very destructive for me. And the people that I know and love. Yeah, and I just think they're too young and inexperienced and they don't have enough like a wide enough grasp of the world to actually speak to those topics at the top of their intelligence because you know, you're not supposed to question. You also brought up before like we are taught to fear our emotions they always use the Verse, that's like the heart is deceitful.	-1.0
2	Above All Things. Oh, yeah, that was quoted to me my whole life.	0.0
4	Yeah, and really that's the way of Christians silencing and shaming each other into shutting up. Like if you have a you know with my being gay is not a sin videos that I just came out with so many people are like don't trust your heart your heart is deceitful and it's like you got your telling me that we need to abandon our like intellectual the only what happened like Ville of your reality.	-1.0
2	Yeah that never made sense to me because it honestly it was used as just like a silencing tactic and a way for like Christians to feel like they could be above other Christians. I feel like like they felt like their point was like being offended when they could pull that verse out and kind of like it's because they don't have a point but beyond that point.	-1.0
4	Yeah, like if someone shuts you down and another phrase that uses cherry picker, you can't cherry pick. The Bible and what's convenient for you? And it's like well that phrase is really convenient because all you have to do is like and I remember feeling that way when I was saying these things to I knew that if you scratched a tiny bit below the surface, I would have to be like, I don't know shut up like like I don't have an answer be on don't trust your heart and I don't have an answer be on my pastor told me so so everybody shut up, you know, like well, I don't want people to fear that that's why I respect what you're doing. Doing so much and I don't see our channels or our ideals in major conflict. Actually.	-1.0
2	I'm not a liar the fact that you're an atheist. Yeah and like that. I recommend your channel to so many people who comment on my videos because yeah because like you do not at all represent the things that I am opposed to you know, like and I think it goes back to this idea of when I was a Christian and when I would kind of be going Like what you're going through trying to defend gay marriage and like all these things. I was always very analytical of this idea of God and in my head I was like if you're telling me that he's a loving God. I feel like we have to be able to attribute certain qualities to this deity. And so often when you are kind of like the girl to find girls who are living in this Christian bubble who like just read the scripture in her.	-1.0
4	So like blindly following it without opening their mind to any sort of like, I don't know the only very specific scriptures, by the way, because yeah, they much like me or the pastor's I've had would quote like something really beautiful and then you read two lines down and it's like by the way, like slavery is should be honored and you're like wait what people that's what's so funny because I recently did a video about gay marriage as well and I was responsible.	-1.0
2	Going to a channel called Paul and Morgan and they were quoting Leviticus and then all these people were commenting saying if you just read a few more verses down like that's the same book that talks about not getting a tattoo and she has a tattoos all over her arm.	0.0
4	I know and I know the hypocrisy of that drives me crazy and well again for anyone listening that's not from the Christian background Leviticus is in the Old Testament and it's a very very very very heavy-handed role oriented book and and the rules include, you know, you should be basically ostracized from your community for having period sex no tattoos. No and then or like man shall not lie with a man, but you're like wait you guys? Oh, don't braid your hair.	-1.0
2	These are no mixing Fabrics. Like they are very specific things.	0.0
4	So for any modern Christian, you know, that's one of my main argument. To it's like we can't be citing this ancient texts that we've already willfully decided as a community that we're abandoning the majority of these like tenants. Yeah, but you're still conveniently for the sake of your argument pulling from that like you said ignoring the fact that you girl are covered in tattoos.	-1.0
2	So stop with that. Yeah, but like, of course, I knew like that there were hypocrisies about Among the like Christian Community and so I don't want anyone to ever think like that's why like I left because I've always granted like there are you know, good people and bad people in every community and every group, you know, and so so I never really liked of course things could be hurtful but like that never caused me to then think like, oh, well God must not be true because all these Christians are hypocritical. Like it was never that way of thinking and I know it's hard for some people to understand like one of my videos recently got promoted by YouTube and it's actually really annoying because I have all of these Christians who are just so hateful like leaving so many nasty comments. I'm just like why are you liked so many people try to say like like not all Christians are bad, but like when 99% of the people are so I mean and then you get like one nice one and it's like okay obviously like something needs to change here, but they were all saying like you were never a real Christian. You must have never been saved like that's just impossible because and I feel like it's a defense mechanism where it's like if I was a real Christian and then left like what does that say about their belief system, you know, absolutely I think it's very fear and that's like it's so much projection and that's why you know,	-1.0
4	No, I'm no better or worse than anyone else. But that's why I keep saying like don't be afraid to have a real conversation with an atheist or like someone outside of your belief system. They can't you know stand firm in your beliefs. Don't be scared. And if there's something that scares you then dive in deeper like yeah, it's scared me when I read, you know, women need to be silent at church. That was one of my really defining moments where I shut the Bible and looked up at God and just was like yo, Yeah, what like I was like so beside myself about that. I was like just like I've been honoring you all of these years and I'm made to like sit here and read that like, what does that mean? And it did not shake my faith. It didn't turn me away from God instead. It caused me to be more intellectual about my faith to be more curious about the history of it and I'm far from knowing everything but like People should be inspired to be intellectual not scared of it.	1.0
2	Yeah, there's this Christian who I actually really like I mean, I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I really like him and his name is Sean McDowell and he gave like this really cool talk where he pretended to be an atheist at a Christian college and he put on his atheist glasses me like talk to them as if he was an atheist giving all of like, you know, the atheist answer. is I guess and for the most part I thought he did a pretty good job, but then he kind of like took his glasses off and was like, like how do you guys think you did and it was just it was like how did you feel when you were being like questioned by me and like you weren't really winning the argument so to say like and they were like like I was mean to you like I was aggressive and I was defensive and you know, I felt attacked and I just wanted to prove you wrong so bad. Like I wasn't being loving through that and he his point was basically like Christians shouldn't be scared of Doubt because they should be a Christian because they believe that it is true. And if it after all of the research that you do if you come to the conclusion that you don't think it's true. Then you shouldn't be a Christian and he said that's okay you like you have to not be afraid of just pouring all the facts. Out there and and being true to yourself in that and of course he wants everyone to be saved but like no, that's really beautiful.	1.0
4	I love ya. Can I ask what was the video that YouTube started promoting of yours God.	1.0
2	I don't even like the video it was dumb. It was video called why I left Christianity and it was actually a response video to a different video that I had made where I had said like, you know, I was silenced in church and like I wasn't allowed Odd to ask questions and like all this stuff and people were like, you know commenting on that and so I did a response video basically clarifying saying I was allowed to ask questions, but I could only ask them once and then once I asked them and got the Christian answer it was like that's your answer like accept it and if it wasn't good enough for me. It was like why are you like beating a dead horse? Why are you still so like, you know, you're just trying to like, you know, put your Deceitful Wicked heart into scripture because you want you know it to be the way you want it to be in like all this stuff and it was just such a misinterpretation of me. Just trying to like learn more and do research and it was like if you keep talking like that you're going to talk yourself right out of this face like you don't sound like a Christian to me and it was just kind of a lot of kind of it wasn't even a very accurate title now that I'm thinking about it because I truly clarified and said I left because I didn't think If the facts were there but in the midst of me doing all this research and and kind of getting all these questions brought to the surface. I was a bit frustrated that I was like borderline not even a Christian at this point and yet you know people I knew who wanted to go into Ministry who were dedicating their life to this Faith didn't even care enough to know the deeper side of their belief system. Like they just had no interest in looking deeper and study. Harder in in answering my questions and like I understood that everyone has their own life and you know, they can't just put it on pause to then, you know study all this stuff with me, but it did frustrate me that the church in itself did a poor job of preparing Christians for the tough questions. Like if there's an atheist who knows apologetics better than Christians, that's that's not good. Good, you know I don't know I feel like that video was like misinterpreted through the YouTube space is crazy.	-1.0
4	I keep telling my friends. I almost feel quite lonely in it because nobody else understands what I'm going through necessarily. Yeah, and it's fine. I'm not like going through stuff but like but at the same time, I'm like, yeah, I wake up every morning and people are screaming that I'm going to hell and like it just kind of feels like garbage to my soul sometimes.	-1.0
2	Yeah. It has to be even worse for you because they say that to me but if I don't believe in hell, it doesn't really affect you as much I can't imagine that's horrible.	-1.0
4	Yeah. Well and I think that I usually think comments are they make me laugh and I actually really enjoy talking to haters like yeah, you know the sweet-looking, you know young person just wrote something like well you're sending everyone to hell and you're going to hell yourself. And yeah, I just like called her out. and was like hey, why do you believe that like, do you know that I'm a person and you're saying that to me on the internet and that's like actually such a terrible thing to say to somebody and a lot of them apologize because it's not about me convincing them that my way of thinking is right, but it's more about the more defensive you are and lieu of actually being an empath and listening and like allowing people to On their own Journeys with patience and love instead of always trying to like get everyone onto your team. The more effective you are just as a human being in general, but especially as a Christian, I don't understand what church is telling people that's emboldening them to go online screaming about someone else going to hell like that's yeah. Jesus was not walking around Jerusalem screaming about hell. Yeah, so I'm like, where where did you guys even get that from and what? What scripture is that the way you're supposed to be handling people that you disagree with?	-1.0
2	Yeah, sometimes I'll read the like really mean comments from Christians and I'll just comment back and just be like do you think like you said that out of love like it was that really a loving thing to say like it just it doesn't mean McColl its righteous judgment and I have every right.	-1.0
4	Yeah, pretty much. What was the feeling of really coming into your atheism?	0.0
2	Well a lot of People kind of say like, oh you just threw the baby out with the bathwater like you jumped from Christian to atheism and that wasn't the case at all. I actually still believed in God for probably two years after I stop calling myself a Christian and I just had this feeling of like organized religion put God in a box and like it forced us to have these certain stories that were culturally specific and that didn't, you know, go over like to other countries. Or whatever and I just remember having this like since the freedom where it's like I could go to any country and experience like what they consider like profound spirituality and I could apply that to my life without feeling like, you know, it's not accurate and and I just remember thinking like all these religions throughout the entire world have claimed to have spiritual experiences. They've To have these miracles happen and I just I didn't like thinking like they were wrong and I'm right and like my specific story is like the one true truth and like shedding to that story itself allowed me to view like God in a much more like open way that I found super inclusive and inviting and more cohesive. And you know, I still actually hold a lot of those values. Like I want I think I'm still slightly bitter when it comes to organized religion, but I definitely want to get to the point where I can go, you know to other countries and experience, you know, their religion and their culture and everything that comes with that and just, you know, apply that to my life and you know become a better person based off of these were	-1.0
4	The experiences we'll buy a theist and and not agnostic.	0.0
2	Well, I actually consider myself an agnostic atheist. So basically agnosticism is, you know a claim about knowledge. Like I don't know if there's a God or not, but I'm an atheist because I don't currently believe in one. I don't I don't think that I don't know like I don't think there's a God I don't Necessarily see a lot of proof of a God, but I'm more open to that conversation of maybe because I know like when people start talking about science and I start talking about like the origins of the universe and all this stuff. Like that's very fascinating to me and it's not something that I have studied as much as I would like to um, but I never want to be like one of those people where I'm like, yeah, there's absolutely definitely not a God and I'll fight you like to Able to prove that it's like no like I don't have this like hidden agenda. Like I don't want there to not be a God on top of that my friend circle like since their identity was in Christ my identity to them became non-Christian like that is all I was to them or that's how it felt and I would be like introduced as like, oh, this is Nicole. She's a non-Christian. Like this is my reward. Yeah, like to their new like church friends and you know more extended people it was like this is my non-Christian friend like that will know that was my label and it was so like demeaning and I'm like literally that's all I am. That's all they see is the lack of belief in their God and then I've had some people stay like you're never going to know true Joy or true happiness or true fulfillment. You're never Have purpose and your life is like destined to be meaningless because you don't believe in our God and that's just like so mean to say and it like really breaks people down and I think that goes back to this idea of like if you break people down enough, they might come back to the belief system and it's like such a manipulative way of going about things for them.	0.0
4	But I always I feel like it's so much fear because I remember feeling I remember being on the opposite side of that I could see myself introducing someone as a non-Christian back in the day, not tomorrow. Yeah, but I was I love God so much and I have for so long that if anyone didn't have that and then and then when I can Christian church or an Evangelical Church when they're pounding into our heads like you said, this is your identity. This is the thing that gives you purpose. This is where true happiness. Flies I just felt sad for people that didn't have that. I wanted them to have like salvation. And then when I was even younger I was so scared of everyone going to hell. I was like, oh God, I love Nicole so much. I really don't want her to go to Holland is actually like excuse perience a genuine heartbreak on both and and it's not healthy for either party.	1.0
2	Yeah, and I think that's something that I would encourage like more Christians to think. about is that like is it possible that these people that do have a good amount of self-worth and that are happy and fulfilled in their life and you know are truly living like enjoy like is it necessary for you to then go and like tear that down to try to like put your belief system on them like you could be causing more her and more harm and I honestly think that that kind of is what happened when I was 12 like I was such a happy The little girl and like that didn't obviously go away overnight, but it was like I didn't necessarily like need these messages that they were telling me and they didn't they didn't help like they didn't make me feel better necessarily but I mean a lot of this like analyzing has come since I've left like, I don't want people to think that like I was miserable for 10 years because I wasn't like I still liked my time as a Christian, but it's just looking back. It's like, I don't know if I would Choose that again.	1.0
4	Yeah, I mean I wouldn't as same thing for me like at 12. That was when I first was told that I'd be worthless if I had sex before marriage and like you're saying identity wrapped in Christ. My identity was wrapped in my virginity that was definitely an aspect of it as well. Yeah, so like and then when I wasn't a virgin anymore and even when I was married, I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know what made me a good. Person anymore because that's all I was like, that's all I heard about. What a good person is a good person is a virgin. Well, yeah. Yeah, it's a disaster. So my Christian advice to anyone in countering any theist or someone that simply doesn't believe the same things or God forbid a Christian that actually believes different things than you two just like trust the Holy Spirit if you believe in God you Proclaim to like believe that Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit puffs. Faith that like everyone is on their own journey and everyone's going at their own rate.	-1.0
2	And if someone's meant to encounter God in a specific way that will be taken care of with or without you harping on the person and actually it's probably less likely to happen if you are harping on the person so just like it's like they could go and they could be showing so much of like, what is it like what day want to like show the person of like if they say that they have God inside of them. It's like are they really showing that because right, you know, a lot of the Christians, you know, people want nothing to do with them because they're so mean and so it's like why would we want your God if like this is what he looks like in my core. I think I fundamentally think we as Humanity are intrinsically good and and I know that like a lot of Christian teaching is that like we're intrinsically evil, but I guess I was just kind of encourage people to step away from I'm like necessarily putting that on all of humanity. Like I don't know. I'm just so positive and I'm so optimistic and like I know there are so many bad things in this world, but I feel like they're always met with like an overwhelming amount of love and support that shows like the goodness of humanity. Like for example, the Orlando nightclub shooting that happened, you know, that was like horrible, but after that Like there were so many people lined up to donate blood and I think just like recognizing that that we are like capable of doing so much good and and focusing on that and then also recognizing that people are so much more than a label like there's so much more than a single word or a single defining term and if we can accept people and like truly accept them. For who they are and not try to change them. I think will realize that it's okay to disagree because those labels don't Define who a person is like I don't Define you by your Christian faith, like you're someone who is fighting for Change and promoting love and acceptance and kindness and equality and those are things that I agree with so if we can focus on what we have in common instead of what divides us, I think, you know, we can you know, Live in a much better world just recognize that the people like your enough like your enough just being you. I don't know like I just feel like like it's in us like we're just good. Well, thank you so much for this conversation. It was awesome.	1.0
