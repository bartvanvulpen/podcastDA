This episode is brought to you by Verizon Verizon is more than a phone company Verizon Prides itself on being a reliable partner for business keeping operations of all sizes ready for what's next with new technology like 5G ultra-wideband Verizon is set to transform the Way businesses operate see how at horizon.com ready. From gimlet media. I'm Josh puccio and this is the pitch. On today's episode a Founder pitches his startup meant to provide TurnKey mobile apps for retailers. He insists it's unlike anything else on the market but in a world where it seems everyone has an app can be convince investors. There's really an opportunity here. Bill Nadel is with Forefront Venture Partners. Phil is all about the numbers will only go in on a deal if you can make the math work. If for some reason the members don't bite then the thing falls apart Jillian Maness is with structure Capital. She's quick to size up the potential in a start-up and its founder and you can count on her to put her money where her mouth is there is no doubt in my mind that you're going to do this. I really feel that Daniel Galati is with Comcast. He loves the high stakes of venture capital and he'll take a gamble on a long shot startup if he senses an opportunity in the billions. I think the only way to make money in VC is to take a non consensus view that turns out to be right and finally on today's episode angel investor James Alta jerr. He looks for Strategic investment opportunities where he can bring his expertise to help us start up really get off the ground. I would be happy to advise your company	1.0
1	All right before yesterday and now this is a potato chip.	0.0
3	That's a brand. Yeah, it's a pretzel too, right? They make pretzels to I don't know. So but if you want in the TV show Mad Men even their future that's potato chips. Hey, hello. How are you? How are you? There's a lot of alliteration in that. That's great. Darling Smith darling Smith your mother. I feel like that could be like a superhero name like the secret identity. If Sterling is a superhero, it's safe to say this pitch is his first time donning a cape under the lights in front of the investors. He looks nervous.	1.0
1	So yeah. Again, my name is Sterling Smith, and I'm the founder and CEO at sandbox Commerce. So so so for four years ago, I decided to leave my my career at a management consulting firm to start sandbox Commerce. So my friend said what the hell are you doing? I had a pretty comfortable potential. It is stay there for the next 20 years for the next 20 years, but I kind of already saw the glass ceiling so I could tell that you know, my limit my options were limited working for that for that company so I decided all right, so Sterling's a little rocky out of the gate, but the story he sharing is your classic entrepreneurial Journey.	1.0
3	He had a good cushy job as a software developer in DC and was all set to put his career on cruise control for the next 20 plus years, but he got the startup Edge. H and so he traded it all in to move to Austin, Texas and start sandbox Commerce. His company takes the knowledge. He gained as a software developer and puts it to use building mobile apps for retailers.	1.0
1	What we learned after building several mobile applications for retailers was that it took on average six six weeks for us to build it, but it would shock the retailer would would pay us nearly $250,000 a year.	1.0
3	Incredibly expensive and Incredibly time-consuming Sterling realized this was a huge pain point for retailers. They want to be able to offer the convenience of an app to their most loyal customers, but customized apps were too costly for most retailers.	-1.0
1	So Sterling created sandbox Commerce to give them a plug and play solution our platform helps those retailers save, you know, six months and nearly $250,000 and it and we've been we've been working on that for about the last eight. 18 months and we believe that sandbox Commerce is a platform that provides opportunities to like no other platform that exist on the market today.	1.0
3	Sterling hopes to raise $250,000 to help make sandbox Commerce the premier company for retail mobile apps but first he needs to calm his nerves and convince investors. They should take his pitch. Seriously. I'm a retailer and I want to make an app so that people can buy on their phones my products. What do I what do I go to you for?	1.0
1	Ya. So you simply visit our website you enter some basic information. We use your existing e-commerce platforms API. To pull in your data and then why don't you show us the product?	-1.0
3	I think it'll help us visualize a little bit more. Yeah, so I'm going to show you I'm going to show you two pieces of Sterling pulls out his computer and shows the investors the app designer dashboard, which as the name implies takes you through the steps to easily design your app. And as soon as he starts showing off sandbox Commerce Sterling's Jitters start to melt away. So this dish right here renders in real time.	1.0
1	So you see how the load this sir is here as you paste those in and then you go to the bottom and click save and view it actually updates in this emulator on the left hand side.	1.0
3	That's great.	1.0
1	And do I have to speak with a sales person or anyone before I start know so you come through so we want an IBM ux/ui award for the usability of our looks great.	1.0
3	So you can come in and just start playing around and editing. I think that's really interesting that it's just low friction way to kind of visualize and	1.0
1	Up, so effectively a Mobile retailer non-technical person typically in the marketing department would visit our website click, you know, discover sandbox Commerce and an actually go down this list and an inner in all the details.	1.0
3	At this point it feels like Sterling has hit his stride that nervous shaky founder who opened the pitch is but a distant memory and you can feel it in the room as he grows more confident the investors start to really engage. Okay, and what's the size of red tears?	1.0
1	Yes. So online retailers who are generating at least a million dollars in Revenue.	1.0
3	So, why would they need you though? 30 have apps right there you have it.	-1.0
1	But so no, so two percent of retailers have mobile.	-1.0
3	Right now, okay that's shocking to possess it. That's the whole Market which includes we chose doing that's two percent of nothing. That's two positions and number of retailers.	-1.0
1	Yeah. So if you're looking at the the IR 500 which is a sampling of a top 500 retailers in the market 60% of those retailers don't have don't have a mobile app don't have no looks 60 that's shocking don't have any mobile app, and why because it's a very risky proposition if you are a retailer and you You want to build a mobile app and the case of a smaller retailer whose generating a million dollars or more in Revenue? Yes, that retailer spending a quarter of a million dollars the first year to build that mobile application. Yes. Okay. So a brand like Cabela's or Macy's is spending at least a million dollars per app store today. Okay, using our platform. They're spending a fraction of that and so we're giving you with a single SAS fee a turnkey solution that you don't have to worry about.	1.0
3	This TurnKey solution cost a lot less than that million dollar price tag for a nap on either iOS or Android Sterling's company offers a basic package at $500 a month for a nap in both app stores double that you might be thinking a thousand bucks a month for just a nap. I've seen way cheaper options but not so so Sterling not for what they're building fully native apps.	1.0
1	Yes, and we are the only company that builds fully native apps. There's their Raps that if you visit a website on your phone, it looks good. It performs well enough but it does it's not as it's not it doesn't perform as well. It doesn't you don't typically have access to your camera. If you need to do augmented reality or you can't really take advantage of location awareness. You really can't take advantage and many cases of push notifications. There are wolves in sheep's clothing that are building mobile apps that you can download from the App Store that are actually using Technologies like PHP without getting the weeds. Those are those are web Technologies. He threw all those wolves. Do you have any put them on I want to really put them out there like that.	-1.0
3	Are we talking are we talking this Squarespace is of the world.	0.0
1	So not squarespace's although I will well whoever they are.	-1.0
3	These so-called wolves do build mobile apps, but they are not customized to iOS or Android. So they're unable to take advantage of the great technology already built into your phone and therefore their apps kind of suck. But according to Sterling the fact that he's building fully native apps isn't even the best. part of sandbox Commerce	-1.0
1	So the real honey is we are the first company that takes it even one step further. We provide you with the ability to know exactly who those customers are and actually learn from those customers in real time where they live who they are what they liked on Facebook if they're using iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 5 you're seeing when the last time they open a push notification how many items I have the card you're seeing the detail now on this surface at a micro level that's pretty cool. But at a map Pro level you can say anyone in Austin Texas who is between the ages of 18 and 35 send them a push notification and let them know that we're having a pop-up shop and that if they bring their device they can get free Kool-Aid whatever the heck.	1.0
3	So this has Sterling would say he is the honey when a customer uses a Retailer's app. Sandbox Commerce is able to collect data about those customers for the retailer. The assumption is of course that this will help them better Market to these customers Amazon for example has an insane amount of data on people's buying habits and they use it to sell more stuff. But if you're a retailer that sells on Amazon you don't get access to that info Amazon Hogs that sweet sweet data for themselves now you Sandbox, Commerce retailers will have their own little stockpile of data. What does that do for them?	1.0
1	It gives it the moment that I show them this - where the first time they were like, wait. Wow, the first question we showed this they were like, okay the Mobile store Builder was super sick and we've worked with you early on takes to grow the business but this like, okay this is this is special like payday do the data so they learn where the customers are.	1.0
3	So what did they do with this?	0.0
1	So so they're sending their adding them to their our email marketing drip campaign. Sorry, they're adding them to their email marketing drip campaigns and beginning to correspond with those customers.	1.0
3	How does a brand you know, as how does a brand convince users? Hey, you need our app as opposed to finding us on the web and Amazon Walmart.	0.0
1	Excellent question a company like any brand can do this the example that I can give Jayla body. Oh, they have their customers when they purchase their headphones from Best Buy Target and Best Buy Target or am On and the packaging they have a getting started guide that says hey first charge up your headphones then download the mobile app, then go to this custom screen that I developed using sandbox Commerce and and follow the steps to actually burn in your headphones and say and the enemy another come give me an example of something. So beard.com which would send in a coupon that says take off 15% of your mobile application of your your razor your You're shaving cream of your next purchase. If you download the application and enter this dish that sounds like through all post-purchase incentives.	1.0
3	Right? Are you concerned that generally consumers don't like to download more apps any more so because they have so many and so that that is that was a preconception that that's a commonly held belief.	-1.0
1	I think that there are a couple reasons why that that is that that is not necessarily the case. So for example, so the 20s And if folks that download the apps tip brands app is a brand Enthusiast.	1.0
3	They're already following them on Snapchat Instagram and Facebook and that that 20% typically generates 80% of the revenue the if they have a compelling reason for every retailer to get their customers to download an app and it's I don't think it's easy to do.	1.0
1	We're really focusing on driving and customer engagement, but the but the reality of the situation is that a customer doesn't need to keep the app on their phone a customer simply needs a login one time and you've Got that valuable data, they can download the app register one time and delete the app and you've got the data.	1.0
3	So it's Sterling is basically saying is hey, we don't even need people to use the apps. We make for retailers. All they need to do is get people to download the app and sign in one time and Sterling gets this Treasure Trove of data that he can pass on to his retailers to tell us about the IP around this. Do you have patents around this as obviously proprietary proprietary?	1.0
1	Are we don't have any patents at this moment? Have you found someone with we are the process of filing a provisional patent for one of the things that we're working on?	0.0
3	I think we're Jillian's getting out is where is the defensibility here? I've been long time. Right? So we see Squarespace. We see all the platforms Magento Shopify etcetera and we're kind of thinking are they gonna do this? And one of the answers could be you have some you have all these data right? And so is there some sort of Data Network effect.	1.0
1	There's a network effect.	1.0
3	You get all this data from all these retailers and that makes you sort of Target better. And yeah, so that's don't talk to that. For those not already in the no network effect is when the more people use something the better the product becomes for example. Google is a popular search engine. So more people tend to use it and the more people who use it the better the search results it gives because Google is learning from every single user and this is one of the reasons why it is so hard to knock off big tech companies. They have such a massive Head Start in refining their product.	1.0
1	The network effect is a very important component. That once we have a hundred retailers on a platform we then have industry information. I think that's really interesting. So no and so that's that's really what we're talking about that a little bit on my phone. So so many companies we I'm talking to you fast. Sorry. It's okay. We are a we are the we are presenting ourselves to be that leader that thought leader in this space. We have a ton of information. We have a head start. What we need is investment dollars to help us Market this platform. It's ready to go.	1.0
3	But where I was going with something more specific which is how does retailer 103 benefit from the hundred to retailers that you already have. You've got all this data around these audio. What's that company's name? Jjolbodyo. Jjolbodyo is customers, right, you know the names of the customers, you know, their purchase frequency, you know their usage frequency. And so if you get the third Audio company signing on to sandbox, can we cross marker two different customer bases? Can we say? And across different an economist lie, and and that's where I think it becomes really defensible and really valuable is if we can if we can say to the thousandth customer you benefit from the 999 other customers that already signed on the network effect of the data and the but the ability to provide even our existing retailers with automated information about the data, you know on a recurring basis, huh? But it's Daniels vision of the of the network effect is	1.0
1	And but I don't know if that's your business not so yes Daniel articulated and part Danny took my thunder and part. Thank you. That's it. I don't know. I think Thunder stealer. I know I thank you for that barring your thumb to give you do due diligence there. The reality situation is at almost every company that you hear from on the pitch is going is needs to be moving toward machine learning and artificial intelligence. And I think that as we grow and we them More customers we have the more valuable the business gets and so as we grow that Network effect provides us with industry data based on verticals like a pit like apparel Electronics, etc. For each of Our Brands that industry is gay this seems different to me than the network effect.	1.0
3	You're referring to where I as the Thousand customer benefit from all previous. It's uncertain whether Daniel and Sterling are really on the same page here, but it may not matter. They both agree that the more retailers Sterling has the more valuable his overall product is so how many retailers does he have? So you how many customers do you have now?	1.0
1	So we've got so we've got did bait. Eighth of a tan beta we've got we've got 10 paying customers. So what's that in Revenue? 5,000 a month. She 5,000 ninth yesterday. Yeah, and then the others are we're converting. We're still learning from those customers.	1.0
3	It seems like he built a really great product and can totally see retailers using a I just want to understand is this a 10 million hundred million billion 10 billion dollar Marty six billion dollar market. So, how do you so let me tell you how I would think about Market size images you say you're going after the Middle Market right 10 million 250 million hundred ten million 100 million in Revenue. I think about Market size is how many retailers exist in that sort of bucket. How many of them don't have an A. Nap and what's your sort of annual price per retailer really backing through to the market? I just worry that we're going after a nice hundred million dollar market but not a ten billion dollar market, excellent. So the total addressable addressable Market our addressable Market is 6 as 36 billion dollars currently right now, but you and that's yeah, you can't think you can't think of it as total retail Stan you got to think about it as what Revenue can we get from our Target? But he said that their issues billion years being spent by these retailers on mobile. If you look you're not going to get right you're gonna we're gonna work.	-1.0
1	We'll get it. We'll get a person. Yes, I like that.	1.0
3	Yeah, I don't like that percentage. So that's like saying yeah, everybody in China needs a refrigerator. I get 1% of that, but that's why we need to go bottom up and he talked about how many retail basically Daniel is saying. Yeah, maybe you can estimate your Market at 36 billion but chances are it's a lot It's smaller than that maybe even closer to a hundred million. And if you're playing on the level that these investors are that distinction is pretty crucial and how much you Rising now, we're raising.	-1.0
1	So we're raising a bridge round effectively to focus on sales and marketing we cells in marketing and at 250 right now and we've already got a hundred committed to 250 raising 250 bridge at what valuation 5 million to invest any of your own money about 50.	1.0
3	Okay. So this is your all and I'm not	-1.0
1	That's critical. So the reason why we're raising 250, I didn't get to that point yet. The reason why we're raising 250 is because we are 20 customers away from being profitable 20 pounds.	-1.0
3	So your goal for this business is to heck no before Daniel can even ask so your goal is just to get to profitability Sterling is all over this question.	1.0
1	I just I'm able to go to the table with it from a different perspective as a profitable entrepreneur and so in January with	1.0
3	This 250 I want to raise a much larger round relatively speaking and really go and really own this market Sterling is wanting to raise the 250 now to help them get to profitability with the plan of raising a much larger round in 2018. Sterling has made his pitch now it's decision time. Here's Daniel is how I feel which is I I'm a huge believer in Sterling Smith the founder. I think you're super Scrappy. I think you've pulled together a team on not that much money and you've frankly built a product that I think at least looks great relative to the other, you know, many quasi competitors or similar products that I've seen in the market my my I'm going to hold off on committing here because my biggest question is Good size. So I don't yet know how big if you get 50% market share or 20 percent market share of your target retailers. And I think all businesses need to start somewhere. I get the we're going after Nan retailers and I get that, you know story but I think you're going to have to nail your target sort of mid-market retail segment. First So my answer is I think it's really interesting. Would love to connect with you after the fact on Market size. Excellent. That's Amelia actually there. Really good segue to my control, which is I want to invest in a company where I can pour fuel on the fire where you have a scalable way of acquiring customers and I can add money to it that will let you explode that that's not here yet. Plus I'm afraid you're not raising enough money. You're going to go back and raise again, very soon. Your focus is going to have to be on fundraising and not on sales and marketing. I appreciate that and and that that's a distraction to me. That's a distraction. I'm concerned about for you.	-1.0
1	understand	1.0
3	For those Reasons, I'm going to have to pass. Daniel and Phil are out. Here's Jillian. You look very competent and I like you. I agree. You are Scrappy you are confident. You are very well educated and every single point and challenge. We have thrown at you. I like you a lot and I want invest in you. Okay, very hard stop it period but there is there a couple of caveats.	1.0
1	Don't worry. Okay.	1.0
3	So here's a couple things first of all, I don't think you're raising enough. All right, I'd like you to meet my team my structure team at structure Capital One of my guys Jacob Shay is here in New York now, so I want you to sit down with him. He's the tech guy he was as you know, he's slams it and it's so I want him to start diving into this but I invest in people and a lot of ways and I worry about your defense ability and a very big way. Okay, but the fact is is that I think you have something truly special in yourself and I see it and I want to be a part of this and so let's take the next step. So right I can't commit a dollar sign until I really do a little bit more due diligence. I'm going to hook you up with Jake up in the next couple of days and why don't we carry on that conversation as that is	-1.0
1	That sounds like an excellent plan and I really appreciate your confidence there. Okay?	1.0
3	Jillian is in though. She's not putting a dollar figure on it quite yet. Here's James. I think you're excellent. And you're in a right progression in your career. One weakness. I see with you is that you haven't sold a business nor has anyone on your team. So it's very important almost as important as the other skills combined and so you don't have that and that's that's a significant weakness, but you do I do and so I I would be willing to fill up this bridge by the way. I'm not a venture firm. This is with me with skin in the game. I'd be willing to fill up your round which I think you said this about this about a hundred or hundred fifty left. Yeah, so I'd be willing to fill up that round or what work with Jillian. I'm filling up that round and and and I would require a board seat with some significant voting rights given that I think I would have more experience than anybody who currently have at the moment awesome.	1.0
1	Your Stellar your Sterling. Thank you so much.	1.0
3	I'm very sure that I know never I'm so sorry. I'm not very you know talented on this but I really I think you're really special really appreciate and I look forward to getting to know you better and I'll give ring Jacob a ring at the right.	1.0
1	Absolutely and I'm here until tomorrow. I can leave a little bit later if I need to I think you probably would have to that's not a problem. Fantastic. It looks darling. No, he's not. Thank you for coming and thank you so much pleasure meeting you all.	1.0
3	By the way, we don't know if he accepted my offer.	-1.0
1	I accept your offer.	1.0
3	Absolutely. So we're going to get. After Sterling leaves the room the investors debrief. He was awesome. He was so hard to say you only anything but yes to I mean I can see I can find people for his company right now. I know great salesperson for his company. I think you're also getting in at a good like a potentially a great price. Right? If this guy you couldn't profitability or the structure rounds think that's mocked up, you know, once he hits 20 customers, he's gonna do this. Okay he's going to do there is no stopping this guy you can tell and every time we threw something over the bow is Shot over the bow. He would shoot right back in a very very low respectful way. Sorry, man. But yeah exactly. I have to you think he'll meet I'm hoping he meets with your team. He's going to meet with them today.	1.0
1	Absolutely and then we'll we'll get in touch as well.	1.0
3	After the break I call Sterling to find out if that meeting with Jillian's team ended up happening and where things stand with the Investments made on the show.

I gave him a call to hear what he thought of his experience pitching to investors and to find out what's happened with the investments from Jillian and James. What do you remember from the pitch what sticks out to you?	1.0
1	Basically I felt very nervous out the gate. I was incredibly nervous and it was in my opinion. It was reflected in the pitch because I honestly my opening was Completely different than then I had prepared for and I just kind of got caught off guard by how nervous I was at the very beginning and then I kind of got my bearings back and then I felt good and after a few minutes, so after you get in the room you start pitching so you're obviously a little bit nervous up front.	-1.0
3	But you you hit your stride. The investors were like really grilling you I mean like they were asking the right questions like imagining different use cases. Is for your product like did you think things were going?	-1.0
1	Well, yes within a few moments. I had an idea who I should really be speaking to because it seemed evident that you know, and it's like a lot of pitches to you know, you probably heard when speaking with other entrepreneurs that we've pitched hundreds of times to Angel Investors or VCS and you know, the ones that get it and you want, you know, the ones that don't and there's very little that you can do.	0.0
3	My experience to you know, bring the real someone in who's not engaged.	1.0
1	Yeah, exactly. So who was engaged so I James I mean the whole time James got it. He got it. It was like like I like I was speaking to his soul and then I also felt like Jillian got it, but Jillian was Gillian was also incredibly, you know, she's Savvy as hell and so I mean like she is incredibly Savvy and so like A person like that can like you know, you think that they may have it but you're not sure until they say yes, you know and the other folks I could tell were like they're asking really good questions. So I think they were trying to get there but for whatever reason they couldn't respect, you know, but generally speaking, you know, I could tell that Jillian and James got it.	1.0
3	That's so interesting because from my end. I'm sitting in the control room and I couldn't tell what James was feeling. Because he wasn't saying much and so when he all of the sudden says I want to put in a hundred fifty K and I want to lead the round. I was completely stunned like what did that feel like in that moment?	1.0
1	I mean it felt I can't I can't describe it Josh. I mean, I wish I could I was in I was exhilarated and you know coming back and speaking with some of our current investors about James excitement about coming on board. You know, it's one of those situations to where they were like, oh man James. Oh he is awesome weed and he's he can really make an impact on your business and a positive way and so congratulations that kind of thing.	1.0
3	All right. So yeah what And after the pitch, did you go into due diligence with him? Like what like what happened with James?	1.0
1	Yeah. So we nothing happened James has not invested yet.	-1.0
3	Wait what really?	-1.0
1	No, he has not invested yet.	-1.0
3	I mean you emailed him right like you were up.	0.0
1	Yeah. I mean I did I tried to I try to tread that fine line between persistence and you know annoyance and I definitely I would you know, I'd I tried the hey, I'll be in New York next week. I'd love to grab coffee or are you available to jump on a call at your convenience schedule a few times and I'll person over a few times and also shall respond with a calendar invitation.	-1.0
3	Okay. So like you've heard nothing nothing from it.	-1.0
1	He did like one of my one of my tweets so so oh, that's great.	1.0
3	That's really helpful. I mean	1.0
1	It does suck and not to not to downplay it, but you know. Part of my job is to secure. The bag part of my job is to do what it takes to close it. And you know, if I if I can't do that and or if the if the investor commit sin doesn't like I don't take it personally at all, you know. Any number of any number of things could have happened in his life that changed changed that and and you know, I'm I don't hold it against him frankly. You know, it's just it is what it is.	-1.0
3	Yeah, I'm surprised you're taking this.	-1.0
1	So well, it's been you know initially like in the in the heat of it Josh and then the heat of it like as I'm leaving the pitch back, you know back in Austin. I'm on cloud and Cloud Nine I go through all the steps, you know, it's important for me to be persistent with all investors including James and initially it was tough.

So I've been calling emailing texting whatever I can do to get ahold of James and so far nothing.
