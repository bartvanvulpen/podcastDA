2	Welcome to the show Guido has thank you very much. I'm happy to be here.	1.0
1	It's great to have you on and I think Tim is got a list of questions that he wants to ask you and I don't want to stand in the way of those questions. Let's let's get straight into it. So gido. First of all, have you got a spare couple of days for us?	1.0
2	Time with us for a couple of minutes.	-1.0
1	Okay. So let's let's kick off we know each other from I think through a mutual friend initially gentleman by the name of Tony deed and in Zurich, we have probably Define behind introducing his personally and it would be fair to say that the Tony is an advocate of the so-called Austrian School. I although I didn't know the Austrian School when I set out in my career. I think I'm a little bit more familiar with it. Now, how would You so sum up the so-called Austrian School of Economics.	1.0
2	All the oceans go out from from an academic point of view. I would say it's a continuation in modern economics of the realist philosophy philosophical tradition. All right. So in philosophy of this old debate this all disagreement about the question with that any universals and then this is a real dispute that goes back to the Greeks and then in the Middle Ages, so the The idea that the question was whether there are causal connections or concept more generally speaking that apply at all times and places. Okay, and on this ground, so do people believe that this is true. They are called the real risks and the people who believe that there is no such thing that all stood all times in all places, but all things have we can know only related to particular historical conditions of time and place and We'll have to be identified in and again new and all general concepts that we could ever use are just some sort of Temporaries summaries of what we currently know and currently think well, these people are called the nominal this and the positivist and in the 20th century, the the nominalist have hijacked economics, not only economics but you can always in particular and the only guys left standing on. On the realest cam. Well, there might be a few others, but the most important group left standing is the the austrians. So the austrians think that there is such a thing as economic loss. I saw the call who connections that whole to at all times and all places. If you increase the money supply. Well, then the price it will tend to increase at all times and all places. It's not just to today in France or in the UK, but all in all countries and all at all times. So that's the option position. That's really what makes them. Particular and the others so they don't believe this kind of thing and there's a second thing that also came that has complicated things on top of this namely the idea that they are constant quantitative relationships now, that's that's not at all the same thing, but that's what the the most other economists are looking for right there. So they think that in the social field in the economy there is that Loss of any kind in this should be of the quantitative thought such as the law of gravity and so on that we know from from physics, so there should be a Content constant quantitative relationship between different variables that we have trusted in and again, like one example might be the money's stock quantity of money on the one hand and the price I love you on the other all the austrians don't believe that there is such a constant quantitative. Because the money supply is just one among other factors that influences the price level and it does influence the price level only through the subjective values of all people all Market participants. So Market participants that they are videos that doubt with the faculty to choose and they might change their opinions and I changed the values might change from one moment to the other and of course, they're different one from one individual to another so that makes it there can be no such thing as a constant quantitative relationship. The only thing that is constant is indeed that there is a relationship between the money supply and the price level they're positively related but there is no exact quantitative relationship. I'm afraid that was quite a little bit but you ask me I know it's absolutely right.	-1.0
1	I mean, I'm to blame I'm to blame it. What was your personal Journey? How did you get how do you discover the Austrian School yourself?	-1.0
2	I started off as an engineer. So I studied mechanical engineering took some economics classes some some management classes. The idea was to train for Korea and industrial management, but then I fell in love with economics and kind of Economics that I've the first attracted me was mainstream economics. So Keynesian macroeconomics, it's a very appealing intellectual approach is very flattering to young people who just don't know anything but want to world If you have this is right model to tell Co you just got to push on this button and this will happen when if you pull on this level and something else will happen but it's just sorry he drop it just that point.	1.0
1	I think you've got to the heart of my own skepticism with relation to Keynesian economics. I think Keynes said or wrote around the time that the Great Depression started that we have urged in the management of the great machine. Yes, and I would I'm not an economist but I would argue that the in	-1.0
2	Higher that that is the entire problem with Keynesian economics that the whole metaphor is incorrect because the economy is not a machine the economy is as exactly and that of course, there's cause what back to the enlightenment it's the French and that item and are yes a guy like good immensely and he wrote this book man-machine my you haven't really that all the allotment people that this conviction that really most people will just some sort of rabbits. There. They are. Very few very enlightened people Voltaire said there's something to this effect only one one of two percent probably a rather one percent of human beings are truly human beings all others are just some sort of Rapids and so you can program them as you wish and you just need to fix the loss in this that way. We have a program of social engineering and Keynes was just continue like this you did it with the economics Express. Economic language and the other guys are doing the same thing with mathematical language variety of mathematical models, but the fundamental ideas always the same.	-1.0
1	So we think this is wrong then why does why is it taken? Why isn't anybody else kind of picked up on it and said we'll hang on a minute. Keynesian economics doesn't really work as it should Austrian economics does and of course there are many Austrian economics proponents out there who are trying to fight their corner, but if it It is so obviously correct. Why hasn't the kind of white? What's what I want to get trying to get to is what what's preventing this wider pickup in economics in the universities across the world.	-1.0
2	Well, I mean, I've only not just one one factor that comes here to play. There are several reasons for one for example, is that many people academics in particular just like to play. Yeah. I think it's a very powerful motivation many Meg This like to play with models with numbers.	1.0
1	So they're just like doing this and you can't do that with Austrian economics. Is that right?	-1.0
2	Well, I mean you could that mean that's a people trying to construct austrians by Automobiles and so on but I mean this is against just play play but I think a more powerful reason why this keeps up for so long. It's just because it suits the people are in power, but why why does it why does this is that?	-1.0
1	As you do you think there's a natural tendency towards inflation as in Keynesian or neo-keynesian economics?	-1.0
2	No, it's the other way around. I think that people in power I interested in spending a lot of money. Yeah. Okay. So they're using they looking for justifications of their own activities. They want to know why is it good what they're doing they want to do anyway see and so why they should text more and why they should they be put into place a monetary. Student that allows for the at-will libitum creation of money and here comes canes and he's not the only one who's one of them and explains them why this is a good thing. So therefore I think they'd hire people of this sword there are constructive. So say if you've got this kind of comments off my back when you apply through you make up a research by for research and and so on and say, okay, so where is this? He's leading us right what kind of policy can we justify with this or help help ameliorate and so on if you say well I probably this doesn't justify anything it if it goes anywhere it probably rather leads to criticizing the whole point of intervening in the first place. Well, then they're no longer interested in finding it because you're not being constructed.	-1.0
1	So this is this is a tricky question. But if you had the power to do whatever you want to Change the economic landscape in terms of how its taught how governments make decisions what would you do?	-1.0
2	Well, I would probably get the government out of it. You kitchen I was just completely out of it all education.	-1.0
1	Yeah, so how would that work? Then? How would it how would schooling the how would I kids to be taught them?	-1.0
2	Well, I mean but with hard work, it's been taught before the 19th century Rhino new government that meant so meddling with with education really started only the 19th century before you had. I thought private Association that the church is in particular would take care of this. So it was not needed that anybody tax tax funded education either either Elementary education middle schools high schools throughout the university and so on it was just being handled anyway, and it's true. So this case great great latitude like greater responsibilities to parents who I'd known all parents will beat their children to high school or addicted to the you to the university and so on. Yeah, I think that that would probably the better situation than we have at present in any case people would have much sound ideas as far as all social political questions are concerned because they would not be systematically biased the system that we have right now. I know exactly how it is in the UK, but I see this year in France. And in Germany is the educational level diminishes every year and we've observed with for the past 40 or 50 years. I mean read the level of Education actually diminishes. So they're doing a very lousy job as far as the quality of education is concerned and if you listen to the education bureaucracy in France, the main concern is not really the level of academic achievement. It's equality. So they want to have student populace that is equal. So we want to prevent it some people get ahead of others and get a head start when it comes to the professional life. And so also they want Everybody to be on the same on the other on the start line at the age of 18 or 19 or whenever they leaving school. That's their main objective is not to teach anybody to help people. They just want to make them equal.	-1.0
1	That's the problem and how would you tackle the economy?	-1.0
2	The economy in general.	0.0
1	Yes, it's big question. We don't we don't mess around with small issues here on the podcast, but I think people today what not Libertarians, right?	-1.0
2	They would agree that clearly. I mean we have too much of going lately too much of government intervention everywhere. The results are very bad. If you look at it from the point of view of the actual performance of the system to which they to be by academic. Education that economic growth income and wealth distribution as as far as the economy is concerned all these they always screw up right? So you need less of this the problem if you want to turn it back is that it's really it's It's much more difficult than adding a little bit of it to the existing system existing system. So if you have the current system and you have it more government involvement in education, so on a little more that's not a big shake-up for the whole system. It just makes it paralyzed that it a little bit more if you increase taxes a little bit more that's not a big shake-up. So it just makes it marginally more difficult unless you try to turn. Back, we got a problem, especially in the economy. We got a big problem because the economy is so fragile because it is sort of become a Dead junkie but under the influence of monetary interventions in particular. So if you scale back a little bit of this Q fragile eyes and migrate the bankruptcy of certain elements of the economy at this might entail snowboarding effects that have the potential of going on. On all the rest of the economy with that so it's not easy to go. The other direction of I tend to think that as the rule you should think big as you guys are doing apparently because you're raising a big question and you should not be afraid of considering a complete overhaul just cutting a bit from under-20 something like this. I mean certainly the case of money and government spending in the economy. It's on this concert. I think that's definitely a really realistic option.	-1.0
1	Do you think that with the amount of debt now in the in the global Capital monetary system that we're going to end up getting some kind of a reset in the future in a way that may not be as orderly as some might believe	-1.0
2	I'm not sure. I've always thought for a very very long time that actually we have three options right from the current situation. We added also 20 years ago. Either we allow the government is no longer into beings doesn't try to bail out anybody and so on then we get a crisis and then we get actually a deflationary melt all of the whole system. As the first option the second option is you're just trying to inflate your way out of this and of course that's not really a solution but it will just Frank we will just wrecked the economy because you're the sooner or later you're getting very fast into hyperinflation. And the third option is and of very often is neglected. The third option is just to layer more and more regulations of the economy to it's late. But at the same time to eventually sort of Regulation to try to prevent that deflationary policies leads to higher prices leads to Greater redistribution and so on and so you're walking your way into a completely regulated into effect into a totalitarian socialist. And right now I think we're moving on a path of this way of this world now, that's that's a very I'm sorry. It is not very very very positive and in a bright Outlook, but I mean, we definitely need to take this into consideration. I mean, we cannot honestly all of the present situation is very fragile. So we all know so it's very unstable and cannot we cannot remain there. So where will be moving I think they But people who are running monetary policy or running the state the main objective is to stay at the helm a to keep running the country handed over to their friends when they they self themselves as step aside. So they will not consider the deflation or a mountain solution. They want to avoid hyperinflation. So the for them the way to go is more inflation and at the same time Again, I'm a greater control or the economy size. So I was yeah, if you think of something like the plunge protection T to they exist. Yeah, I mean, I mean the central bank doesn't call it the plunge for taxing to you. This is the jargon. Yeah. Yeah, they call it. Of the New York fed write something. That's all they got.	-1.0
1	Do you think they're actually buying stocks though as well?	1.0
2	Yes. Yes. I know. Okay. Yes, of course I do and that's been evidence of this right?	1.0
1	We know the Swiss National Bank is done. I don't think so. That's that's not that's a matter of public knowledge.	-1.0
2	Yes in the Swiss because the up from the body, but there were stories already a few years back already. The portal was not American. An American Diplomat broke it but some foreign newspaper and they had gained access to whatever information about the practices of the federal rules of me the way they are doing it is well the Americans may not buy American Stock. I mean by shares very companies, but they might buy shares of foreign companies.	-1.0
1	That the why would they do that?	-1.0
2	Well already it might be just the way to go as a quid quo pro quo, right thanks years of American companies and the Americans of anxious of Swiss company. Right? Right. So this way each of them respects the law and still collectively that circumventing the law.	-1.0
1	So coming back to you your point about deflation, which is something that I was considering to be the most likely initial outcome. Before we get some kind of inflationary bust and perhaps a collab complete collapse in currencies, which would love to get your view on in just a second. But so I can get my head round. How how does a deflationary environment unfold when there is so much QE going on there is so much intervention going on the so much debasement of these currencies and at the same time. I mean we're seeing Currencies and becomes like gold move up. How could these how could this actually mechanically happen?	-1.0
2	Do you think well, I mean what happened if the Central Bank does no longer increase the money supply so its own money. Yeah, right or if it doesn't increase it enough so that people who have been counting on the stronger increases. I left in the cold as we've seen lat. Actually quite with the liquidity issues on new are so if something of this at this can spill over right and that's also the reason why the Central Bank step very vigorously in and prevented that interest rates would rise further and panic would Spread spread and so on so under these circumstances, there's no definition of a meltdown, right? But of course my solving a problem springing from debt with more credits. You do not provide a true solution. Yes problems. Right? I mean, this is something that most people are understood that we are in a very tired are paradoxical situation. They were trying to solve problems bringing from debt with there are more credit. This of course observe because we are just reproducing the problems that we had in the past on a higher level almost exactly as Marx put it in the capitalist system reproduces his own problems on a larger scale because it's not difficult to guess.	-1.0
1	Find the point when the bubble actually burst because we get we it's been blowing bigger and bigger and bigger and people might say well look it's working. Right the stock market is up. It was that we had a crisis in 2007 2008. The market is up interest rates are low, but they're still you know, this there's some very small move down you could make I'd argue that they were at a point where they're meaningless, but but it seems to have inverted. Cam has worked how much longer can this work for before it all goes wrong in your view. Is there can we look at history to find a way to predict how close we are to the end of this?	-1.0
2	Very much is not child that authors hear me. I think it can work for a long time depends on the conditions also depends on how people act what what people will do it can act because we have very smart managers at the top of central banks who know the business, you know, what they can do if they cannot do we have generation of politicians who have enough equal. Reconstruction so that they know where they cannot exaggerate it with helping themselves through the printing press. All right, so there's some minimal discipline there. That's and they want to use really the printing press right now to be in Revenue. We're not at that point. Once you're at that point, then you're close to hyperinflation of closer columns, right? There was for example the situation in Germany after World War one and when they had huge public debt deficits for five years in a row, I mean Really huge and eventually, they just need the printing press to get the revenue because the taxes were no longer sufficient. Now even though President Trump has made some very considerable efforts in that direction of the huge deficit in the US as well. But nowhere near the situation which they would truly do need the printing press right right now they can help sell some of the current market. So as long as these conditions Prevail, I don't think we're anywhere near So drun finish stop stop of the this can last for a longer time, but he can't last indefinitely. Yeah, definitely.	-1.0
1	I don't know definitely is it's difficult to say who came to him saying the long run were all dead. So it's really matter.	-1.0
2	Yeah. Nothing lasts indefinitely. Yeah. It's certainly not something for the next three of five years and I don't think it's something that we could and should expect within the next 10 years or something. But I could be wrong. I mean one thing that creates me because the whole doll system creates problems of its own and the problems themselves might get out of that. It's not sufficient that the current crop of politicians and central banks and so on that they are knowledgeable and that they are relatively discipline. So they don't exaggerate the practice of helping themselves with the printing press because there are other problems that are resulting from the current monetary system that we have. The most important ones being that is the lack of responsibility of the dear responsible ization and of the of the financial markets on the one hand and the the consumption of capital on the other hand. Okay. Let me be the first one is probably this needed that I explain this to you and to your audience because you're probably aware of this right that simply if you know that you have some something like a backstop that comes Through the printing press Yahoo! Central Bank behind you or the Central Bank the sues the mission of stabilizing the financial Market well, and it does so with the printing press then this amounts to a socialization of a part of your risk. So as a consequence risk taking as rule is always on. All right, so you get very from oil you valuation of shares and other asset classes and so on and you get equally enthusiastic use of Leverage. I had to do to get the results that you need at least in the short time. I saw the economy is moving on a on a did path. Right and this makes the whole thing very fragile and it's like some sort of apology. So we are with this connection. I believe this is quite obvious. The other problem that I mentioned is capital consumption all that that's less less obvious. Probably and what I have here in mind is that thanks to the printing press you no longer. You destroy a part of the incentives that push people to say, of course, you reduce the intent of to become self-reliant. It's only good food. I've been so on especially you reduce the incentive to save as a consequence. You are diminishing the capital base right now in real terms of the economy. Now the question is how strong is this effect? If you look at the official figures you might think well, it cannot be that strong because we still have increased of capital. Vested in real terms. I looked at the figures as found its true. So this is this is the impression that you get but then of course you also know that governments try to manipulate the figures themselves. And especially in this case the price inflation rate review. You are probably aware of the work of John Williams Shadows dance dados dad's right? So I've been following this for 15 years ago fascinating when I saw this, Because what he's doing is just providing estimates right is no because you don't have the raw data. He's just out of his own experiences just estimating the deviation between the calculated inflation rates with the current methodology and the inflation price inflation rate. That would be calculated with the prevailing methods in the 1980s. So he comes up with differentials of about 7% I think right right now right seven seven nine percent. Sometimes this is Its enormous it's just mind-boggling. So I read through macro economic statistics information about Capital Investments. And so on in the light of his figures and my conclusion was that if you if Williams in is right, then we have been consuming Capital concept is since the mid-1980s something like this and even if he is not entirely right, but it's only half right there probably will be consuming capital for the past 20 years in	-1.0
1	The defense of the FED though, if you take information and strip out inflation, the inflation X inflation rate is remarkably static over time. I got in case you're interested. I got that off at a satirical u.s. Website called long or short Capital. Well, I thought it was rather good the inflation X inflation rate. Will you you knew you were being set up for something as soon as Tim said to be fair to the the FED? It's like there's two it wasn't so right.	-1.0
2	And that is of course that creates a big problem not for the people who are working close to the printing press so people working on financial markets people working in the government and so on but it's a problem for the economy as a whole especially for the weaker parts of the economy, right Working Class People people jobs very much removed from financial markets from the banking industry and so on and we should expect their you should be to observe not in pain. Parchment then indeed.	-1.0
1	I think there are many indicators that show that you think that's you think that's been a factor in the the trends that have become manifest through in the UK context breaks it in in the u.s. Context the election of Donald Trump the fact that you have a nun saying economic underclass that's basically got nowhere over the last 20 to 30 years and he's just frankly feeling pissed off about it.	-1.0
2	Yeah, and I mean I see I've just just personally that's what my father-in-law's who is this is a working class person. So it's just been work out all of his life and he has been able to in France in the 1970s. He is called a how's it going with his family to application? I mean they've been always very disciplined and so on but he could afford all these things could send their children to school could send them to diverse universe. He was paying for all of this. I mean how many Working Class People can do this today? It's just I mean you to be top notch in your activity extremely well paid is a working class object group occupation order to do this. So most people cannot and he was kind of average at the time. So I think if you look at these things even on an anecdotal basis and see what's what are the living conditions real terms. I would how did people live what did they consume? What kind of food they bring on the table? Where did they travel and so on in light of this? I mean clearly they are many signs of impoverishment and on top of this comes of course, I mean we have both right. I think we have Capital destruction. So there is an aggregate impoverishment at the same time. We have this redistribution. So they're out of the fewer resources in comparison to whatever 20 30 years ago. It's a greater chant goes to their people are very well connected and So the other classes and that is of course, that's that's explosive for society.	-1.0
1	We mentioned that the varying degrees of wealth within a society if we look at let's say a selection of different countries. How sustainable do you think the the euro currency system is given that you've got clearly delineations of wealth between the core and the periphery and that's manifest in the in youth unemployment.	-1.0
2	Wait, well, the funny thing is in the periphery you have I mean everywhere you have the same type of problem Google department and greater region inequality. Right? But in the periphery these problems are stronger, especially the redistribution problem at the if you look at people initially the upper class in Italy. There is a greater difference between them and the lower classes in in Germany. Hmm. Or in Spain or Portugal and so on so probably all right. The problems should explode in the periphery and there's an exploding for free as you know that Greece Spain is very particular. I'm very iterative of Spain right there all the way through this crisis. There is a lot of coverage but then the society it's definitely not something they literally went through things that the Greeks for instance did not would not tolerate the silent could say the same for our the Irish.	-1.0
1	Wrong the Irish have been quite stoic by comparison.	-1.0
2	Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So that is a lot of Social Capital emotional Capital moral capital is still there, but you can destroy and consume this kind of capital as well. Right? So we're working our way is one layer of yeah, I think the evidence is strong. It's not conclusive. I think this the evidence is strong that has been Capital consumption as compared to 20 or 30 years ago. And then there are other forms of capital Social Capital ball Capital emotional Capital which all cultural Achievements have been a lot of the way are the basis of our current economic and social order. And of course, we are destroying the winning at them as well. And that's where I see the two problems in the long run another. I mean, I'm an economist so professionally, of course, I'm I'm interested in material things as you are as well because you are working in the financial markets, but I'm much more concerned in the long run about the destruction of the moral foundations.	-1.0
1	Our society's given the situation that you described is not going to change anytime soon. How do you think this is going to play out in the Eurozone going forward? How will it be resolved breakup of the Euro and if so, which country do you think would leave first?	-1.0
2	Well, I think you see it in the case of Greece right when the socialist government came to power the wake of 2009 to to positive the 10 2010 to the left actually, so they got elected because they promised to get wreath out of the Eurozone. Yeah, okay, and they did this they got elected but they didn't take grease all over Europe politicians lying. Well surprise surprise, but I think they were honest when they were running to be elected and then actually they did a lot of learning and they Folly considered what their options were. And the truth is grease dropping out of the Eurozone would have suffered an enormous door back in really comes. Okay, this is this is there's no comparison. I don't say it wouldn't have been good for the country at the long run. Yes. I do believe it would have been good for the country in the long run. Especially if you're no longer on the monetary Lifeline right on the heart-lung machine then well, actually your own economy starts developing organic. Actually production becomes more important than just spending spending money, especially spending other people's money. So that's certainly a good thing but that they would not have survived this politically and actually most of the voters probably would not have liked it. Anyway speaking of Greece right Aristotle once said that actually most people were born to be slave simply people actually most people they they they they don't mind but other people are telling them what they should do and how they should So on as long as they have a nice cozy house and a car and they have enough to eat and saw that they had basically these Aristotle it said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Yeah. Well, I mean for him. Yes, of course that that was the only life worthy of man. Yeah, and as as a rational being so what is our objective as a rational being its he would say well to contemplate those things that they are terminal. But that is not the opinion of most people so I think coming back on the Eurozone their fight. I think even though the problems are greater than the periphery. The cost of moving away from the Eurozone are also greatest in the periphery Germany could remodel The Zone it would be hard but Germany would get along I think actually would be a great relief for Germany because right now contrary to what politicians in Germany always profess maybe that Germany's greatest beneficiary of the Eurozone. I think we actually the guys are funding this writing in real terms because all we what we exporting are real goods and services and what we are getting Hey, what's up promises?	-1.0
1	But what I'm saying what you're saying in these peripheral countries is that the political situations are changing because it's clearly not working. Otherwise, you wouldn't have got a Greek government elected on the basis of leaving the Euro same room same in Italy. So I take your point that it would be bad if people left but it's got to be pretty bad if they're campaigning for governments to actually get them out. So This that's not going to get any better really. It's can only I can only see it getting worse and these differentials becoming bigger.	-1.0
2	Yes, of course the problems that will accelerate but you'll see that what it boils down to its the following right? I mean industry and eventually any sort of productive activity that is not related to tourism. So welcoming British Dutch Austrian and German tourists will just wither away. That's what it boils down to. So these countries then if they stay in the Eurozone, they will have this kind of Fate. It's the writing on the wall.	-1.0
1	But if they if they leave and they go back to a new currency say the new drachma or whatever. It might be. There's no provision for that. Ultimately. We know they just create a new currency. Then that currency presumably would begin its life extremely weak. And that would that would have happened. If I sit in a similar way to the Asian financial crisis the late 90s where The currencies were pegged to the u.s. Dollar but not actually formed as part of a union as we Euro. So what we saw there is a model was the economy's did badly and that caused the pegs to go and then we saw this period of a complete collapse in the currency which made it unbelievably valuable to go and invest in country in companies there and and to visit of course you could stories of Tenten Pounds in Thailand, but it lasted you'd like for two weeks and then then it all settles down and it all recovers and look at Asia now, it's a Powerhouse. Yeah. So this is I'm not saying I'm not saying that we should go to back stick with you.	-1.0
2	Yeah, that's the way to go. That's the way to do it. But yeah, that's not the situation that we have today in the peripheral countries of the Eurozone the situation that we have there is that people are being used to being subsidized out of play. Chuckles yeah, the political leadership of those countries. They I mean in Asia 1997 your Thailand Indonesia. So on the leadership of those countries are no places elsewhere to go. They were stuck with their God their own country. Yeah. Okay, so they were dependent on getting the country back on the rails, but now the political Elites in Portugal and Spain Greece anywhere. Have you brought this lava and Slovakia Romania and so on I mean there Korea's a lot within their own countries and within the operators of the European Union, so they want to go to vassals. They want to have jobs that are created by the European Union lavishly funded so paid under with the same Revenue relation has similar jobs in Germany and so on but then in their own countries, so that's what they want. Their loyalty are not their own country. They are increasingly to this international organization.	-1.0
1	Is that why you think do you think what do you think? Get the breakfast process from your perspective. Do you think that's why it's been so difficult to put it into effect. Yeah, I mean clearly sorry.	-1.0
2	The Elites in all our countries. Well, they have grown together much faster much earlier than the rest of the population. And so therefore for them is already a reality that should never go away and they would like like to keep it this way.	-1.0
1	So I understand this understand this is it is it is it German person working in France? What do you think? What do you think of the Bridget? Process to the extent that you think will ever leave.	1.0
2	I'll tell you something funny the day when breaks it was voted by. So I was in a I was in Paris for because the French army had hired me as a as a member of a recruiting committee for future officers detail. Okay, so the so the morning after the brexit vote I come to the breakfast room. So there's this General and he is happy and I am happy. We're both happy that ranks. It has been voted. He is happy because the Brits are out because it would like the Brits and I'm happy because I'm I'm happy for the Brits because for me this is the right way the right way to go. It's good to be independent. It's good to be a responsible and I was also happy for the European continent because it will force the European continent so that the Eurozone a lot of European union and general to be a much. Much more responsibly. So competition is always good these things.	1.0
1	We had a we had a UK economist John her non-pro be a year ago now and he says this DC this isn't as funny now as it was then and he said his perennial nightmare. Is it in 10 years time? We'll still be negotiating to leave and everyone else already gone.	-1.0
2	Yeah. I know it's really painful to see this must be starting to British friends yesterday and said, oh, yeah. With you so sorry. I mean we are the clowns of the world right now. Running joke and say well, I mean I have great sympathy with with me. I mean I come from Germany. Watch. What do you want me to say?	-1.0
1	It reminds me of a phrase. I heard during the first.com boom. So I ran 99 or 2000 which is the Pioneers get the arrows and the settlers get the land. So in this in this context Britain's actually being a bit of a Pioneer.	1.0
2	Yeah, it's really I mean the kids are all smaller countries where there was much easier. To control the political process. It's much more difficult for somebody from outside to do this input. Right? So but now it's there the result is there and I think I still think brexit will happen. It's just not the same time. They won't properly you need to have another general election in just rode all the resistors out of the out of Parliament and then you you will get it but you will get there and it's a good thing moving to Gold.	-1.0
1	What's your what's your I'm guessing your view on gold is you think it's something that should be own because of the basement of currencies, but but I'd like to like to hear what you think of it at this point in time.	1.0
2	Well, I mean I started thinking about gold from one entry point of view and of course gold would be much better money then feared money that we use today, but I've come to the conclusion that as many other people before the gold is not actually the best man at their Probably something the best money would be something like silver. So I think precious metals probably the best choice. So I'm not a Bitcoin Advocate and so on and like experiments like Bitcoin because they're free market experiences is a great deal of thinking that goes into this great creativity and what I like about it as a professor is that it gets people to think about economic mechanisms or the economic Concepts and so on. So this is all great about Bitcoin, but still don't think that Bitcoin will be good money. So I think the traditional monies that we had in the past gold silver still the best one. Sorry.	-1.0
1	Sorry, sorry to drop to use it. So as a non Economist, I'm I'm thinking that the the classical definition of a money or characteristics of money is it's a unit of account and medium of exchange and a store of value when you say Bitcoin isn't necessarily going to be a good money which if any or all of those you referring to because I'm assuming I'm assuming you're coming from the store of value. Purchasing power perspective, but I may be wrong.	-1.0
2	For me, the the unit of account of function is the derived one. So you have these three function that you find the text books rather three main functions are sort of value unit of account and medium of exchange. Okay, and the essential function of one is to serve as a medium of exchange so much that that's my point of view. Right? So we have this is the essence of money to are generally used medium of exchange but with that but without coercion Well, I mean the whole stew even for those monies that are being imposed right in one way or another right? So it's the generally used medium of exchange and then as a consequence you calculate in terms of that money unless they're very strong inflation or something like this, right then you need to calculate other different places, but the foundations, of course indeed to serve as a store of value and here indeed we have problems with Bitcoin because Bitcoin only serves as we evolve. Exchange or is a store of value for services right now. It's a speculative object and so on but it has no other function whereas precious metals have multiple. Alternative uses not only in jewelry. But yeah, very numerous industrial uses because of the particular very special physical characteristics of these Metals. So that means that in the case of all it's only always have a fallback position and there's always an additional demand industrial demand or non-monetary demand that serves as a buffer to salvage the these Metals if ever the monitor uses put into question. So on bitcoin is much more fragile about that because it has no natural non-monetary use. So I think Bitcoins have come into circulation and can be kept there thanks to the ideological now and not in the negative sense right would just say libertarian talking exactly. Do you need to have people as the commitment who are ready to absorb the losses that come with a fall in the value of Bitcoins some if everybody just cells Because the price is going down. Well Bitcoins will be driven completely out of the market. So for this not to help you need to have people who are committed to bitcoin. So you don't consider it merely as a monitor your financial instrument now in the case of gold and silver you don't need this you because gold and silver have always other users and people who are active in jewelry or who use: silver cellphones or Aerospace. And however, they will be happy if prices go down and so you don't need that sort of emotional intellectual commitment to this. So therefore they are more robust Bitcoins.	1.0
1	That's my point to reinforce that point someone who's just had the catalytic converter stolen from my car because of the the epidemic of thefts that are going on at the moment. Yeah. It's this is a big problem apparently in well, I was a big bump. It's been frozen for me, but it's burnt. It's been a big problem. It's there's an epidemic going on Catholics to convert.	-1.0
2	Yes.	1.0
1	So I think this is this could be a conspiracy to drive us towards electric cars. But but in any case it's happening, so you're absolutely right, but I was very interested in you are getting a sedan chair carried by greater tunberg. That's just me. Me but I was interested in your comment that you said you think silver is possibly better than gold with regard to and why is that the purchasing power of God is always been so high for a whole year.	1.0
2	They that it could only be used for very large scale transactions. I mean starting with the men's suit may be okay, but then buying things like Vehicles buildings That's also a rather large objects. It is never been really a medium of exchange and daily transactions daily transaction was always silver or some alloy of silver or some or bronze or something like this or this storm. Okay, and that's actually a good thing. It's good that people actually own personally control. The money of the country lutely for mises is we talked about the ocean school before and these economies that I admire most is the end of his career. It was precisely this consideration that you stressed a lot. I said, well, you know sound monetary system. It's the people themselves each all individual Market participants who personally control a part of the money supply and so they only had the money in their pockets or at home and so on. So that's truly Democratic populist control of this crucial social institutions and silver allows that if you impose gold on On the economy and that is exactly what has happened in the last quarter of the 19th century. Like when silver was demonetized was a political movement top down movement and gold was imposed as a money on the the economy. Then you automatically get a shot in the arm of thinking because you cannot use Golden daily transactions that it's you need to have some money substitutes that can take the place of gold but in smaller denominations in Daily exchanges So that's why banking has become so strong and has developed. So strongly in the last Decades of the 19th century. Then of course all through the 20th century now, let me close this in and get to the gold treasure gold. So I start thinking about gold as a monetary instrument, but I've come to the conclusion that God is actually very important in a free society and a free economy as a store. value is eat as a natural way of saving for especially for people who don't know the first thing about financial markets and financial techniques that risk management and what have you very straightforward and simple way to save some of your Revenue to put some money aside for your old age and so on it's just too to stock gold coins and that's what people have been doing for many centuries and I think the reason why central banks are so adamant in controlling the gold price and preventing that the gold price in a foreseeable way it goes up which would happen in an actual free market is that precisely goal is the main competitor not necessarily as money for Fiat money, but it's the natural. For financial markets.	1.0
1	Could you just back? I mean obviously when we couldn't go to a situation where we're holding gold coins and paying for things with gold and silver the physical mental again. I guess that's never going to happen, but we could have money that's backed by gold or silver and therefore it we could make small transactions because it's just a denomination of of a percentage of a gold bar. So in other words when Bitcoin first started out it was Worth mere sense. It was just a tiny value. Now, you have to trade a very fraction of a Bitcoin in order to for it to mean anything in in real money. You can't send somebody one Bitcoin has to but it's true.	-1.0
2	This would be very very simple to do it. Right? I mean, yeah, that's not difficult at all. And we have already all the elements in place right now. Like you have several institutions that offer gold-backed accounts. So I can so you could have a gold standard of this sort of very easily.	1.0
1	Is there a danger that if one country decided to adopt this back in their currency with gold but they would not be able to expand their I mean, it's a slippery slope this question, but it will get what they they could then be tempted to undo this if they started to underperform on the global stage in other words if everybody else. Is debating their currencies and moving forward and you're trying to do the right thing yet? You're struggling. This would be a very difficult situation to almost be untenable.	-1.0
2	Well, I mean the difficulty I don't see the difficulty there. That's not come from the fact that the others would be performing better by the Blazing their own currencies, but what they do is just to redistribute existing resources. Thibault, the politically well connected to the detriment of the others the problem I think for for this is ordinarily right for a country that has a sound o better money that other countries right now we've been doing for 10 years now, we've made great efforts to make sure that Swiss franc the British pound Euro and the American dollar becoming more is the same thing as really very few changes. No many just options that we exchange rates and so on but let's say if you have known and foreseeable differences the quality of money to different country. So one country is more inflationary the other is that this stationary What happens is that promotes? Exports on those countries that have a worse money because the residents of those countries. Well, they want to reduce Autumn minimize their Holdings of their own inflationary money as much as possible, right so they want to get hold of a better money. This is what you see in all countries that are so dollar rise rise the phenomena of polarization. All of these countries have export surpluses and the strings from the fact that they need to pay for the dollars that they really want to own. They don't want to all their own. Local pocket money they want to own as our bodies such as the last so long since nobody's giving the colors they need to buy them. So they export so they have a structural export Surplus and therefore countries with the better money than structural import circles. All right. So the the industry is those countries are suffering under foreign competition precisely because foreigners want to get some of the local Honey, that's the reason why the US for example as structural import deficit because many more even though the dollar might be quite lousy as a money, especially as compared to Gold. It's still better than most of the other monies that are around in the world. So people want to buy buy dollars and there are therefore they need to export services to get those those dollars from the US and therefore soup President Trump's policies that try to reverse this trend just with Exponent important controls with tariffs and so on will not succeed. Simply for this reason you see so the difficulty of such a country is not that the police use of work would not workers not before the country. It's that it creates pressure on the local producers. And so you get political resistance from that definitely that's that's brilliant.	1.0
1	Just one final question before we go to Media pigs. If there was when you're talking about Fair currencies, you're looking at the selection of the the least worst options compared to Gold. What is the least worst currency that you can see? Would it be the Swiss franc? Would it be the Japanese Yen who've given that Japan has just come out of a deflationary. Situational tamizh dong what? What? What what? I'm serious. What what what is there is there any currencies so if we if we put gold and silver at the top of your shopping list. What what what appears below it?	1.0
2	Yeah, probably this was Frank. This was founded the main advantage of this fact is that Switzerland so small? That's a it's a such a small. It's not even an exit door. Right? It's it's a it's a rabbit hole. Not many people get through this. All right, so Swiss franc is booty best and the problem with this Swiss is a leech bite because the Swiss this still appreciate stable money that appreciates strong money. It's just some of those sweets and industrialists. They don't like it because they see the increased pressure on that on the on the export business. The Swiss themselves. They like in Japan is different stories. Japan has the advantage so much bigger countries. So it's a much bigger economy. But the Japanese if I understand this correctly, I don't know Japanese mentality at all. But from what I see portrait you and always the media is that they are adamant desperate to create inflation. That's definitely not the case with Japan. Excuse me with was Switzerland. Therefore I would say because the it's a more sane intellectual environment moral environment.	1.0
1	Apparently the Swiss franc seems to be better the Swiss doing what the Germans would have done had they not join the the Year. Yes. Yeah. That's the last Bastion of protecting your currency and doing the right thing not going after inflation at all costs. Absolutely. That's absolutely fascinating. Goodbye. Thank you so much for your time. I know we're probably overrun on the amount of time. It was going to be just before we go. We'd love to get a media pick from you.	1.0
2	Okay? Let me yeah, okay, I can give you what one thing that I read recently. Okay, so many things that I like but as seen at the very beginning we talked about philosophy and sorry some of the servants rather suits but this is really great and it's accessible for everybody. So I have this I discovered this Austrian friends of mine this psychiatrist by the name of Victor, Frankl Viktor Frankl Man suit	1.0

2	This is the one because it's not that difficult.	1.0
1	It's I mean, I mean emotionally difficulty doing quite harrowing to right.	-1.0
2	Yes it is. It's true. But then so once you're through this and the last quarter of the book, then he presents over this intellectual digest out of this right what came out of this and it's really a very positive life-affirming surprising. astonishing comforting comforting View and philosophy is all you on the other problem problem of suffering and what I love most is this ways that while we need to think of the meaning of life in the copernican turn like we need to think the way we are thinking about this because the way Buddhist would think of it and many other people is well with you need to look inside right and goes look for the meaning of life in Our own soul the belly or wherever and then try to realize yourself right go out and then transform the world according to the meaning that you find in yourself and he says it's exactly the other way around you need to look at the world around you and see what challenges it poses to you. And that's where you will find the meaning. That's where you find. The the starting point for Meaningful life is just astonishing it's great.	1.0
1	That's so interesting. Remind him I'll go segue into my one. I saw the limited Netflix documentary series about Bill Gates and I have to say it's absolutely I thought decoding in fact the inside the brain and Bill Gates decoding the brain of Britain. Yeah inside the brain of Bill Gates and it's absolutely fascinating what he's been doing. I mean if you if you imagine yourself with, you know hundred billion and you think well, what am I going to do? You know, he's left my	1.0
2	Microsoft is not running anymore.	-1.0
1	What do you do and it's actually what he's been doing. He's looked at the world. And for example, he he said right there are children dying in Africa because they can't get clean water. I'm going to solve this problem and he writes to the universities in America gets the greatest Minds together funds a few projects which are completely crazy and last week we had on the podcast a guy called Alan Steel who recommended a book called Loom shots, which is about crazy ideas that can change the world and this all ties in with what exactly what he was doing at what he's doing and and he solved the problem. He's created this sanitation system that is just completely revolutionary and I don't want to spoil it for you for other people are going to watch it, but it's exactly what you just said. He's gone out there. He's looked at problems and he said right I'm going to use my money. I'm going to use my brain and I'm going to fix it and It's changed my opinion of him completely. I've heard a lot of respect for him now, but that this book also I think is is is going to be one that I'm going to read because it's it sounds like it's saying the same thing so Tim, what do you have? Well first you have to endure sceeto's selection because Man's Search for meaning is the most inspiring book I've ever read and it's extremely extremely affecting in every sense of the word. So to go from the sublime to the Nicholas I'm gonna go for well, I'm here too because there's a connection between them. The first is Bohemian Rhapsody. And so I saw recently always sort of thought. Yeah Freddie Mercury. Yeah higher pick which is nothing really very special but it's very entertaining. Yes, hugely crowd-pleasing entertainment. The critics hated it the good excited it while it's great. It's quite it's eminently watchable and for anyone of a certain age, I mean queen was just all over the 70s and most of the a 80s now I never bought the queen record, but but you have to admit they they gave good rock. Oh definitely. I was very lucky to go to all the early Queen concerts. I really yeah, you are privileged. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I just I would go to other gigs that my friends were talking about and I would say God this is this is rubbish, you know, because I'm my first few get wise to go to the Marquee Club in London and say a lot of small bands which were great. But my first Stadium gig was a queen gig so I was like, Let me spoil on the Waterworks tool and when it came to Live Aid I wasn't surprised I was like the other band States quote great and some other bands were great. But you know, I'd like Sade playing bass line for 10 minutes before they actually got into their song Along Comes Queen and just like blows everyone knows everyone knows everyone else away in that I knew that this is what they would do because I'd seen them before the other. The other one is another Netflix production called the spy with Sacha Baron. Aaron Cohen, I don't know if you know the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen Dido. He has it Borat and yeah things but this is as far as I'm aware his first serious acting role. There is a major first. It's a very good film. It's a series of day. I think it's a six part series on Netflix very very the true life story of a Israeli spy who infiltrated the the top level of the Syrian government quite incredible true life story, but Sacha Baron Cohen is outstandingly good in this and the reason I mention the connections because I believe Sacha Baron Cohen was originally lined up to play for any Mercury. Yes. He was yes, he's I think he's brilliant the Common Thread here because we've talked about this a bit in the past is it seems easier much easier for good Comics to become good serious dramatic actors either way around I believe so I'd interesting. I mean, I think it's much harder to do what he's done in the past, you know his comedic work than and I I wouldn't be surprised if his acting is absolutely outstanding, but but Guido look, thank you so much for your time, and there's something	1.0
2	Musicians and so on and the lifestyle so answers kind of suspect but what I understood as long as long as you got the sex and the drugs who needs the Rock and wrong definitely impressed me so much was it came out that he was such a good person. Yeah. He was a lovable person. It was good to others. He was just a positive influence on all others around it and this reminded me of another thing there. Documentary has seen many years before about alphabets right Elvis.	1.0
1	Yes. Yes. He was the same thing.	1.0
2	It's not just the music is something about the person it is This Walter. It radiates as Goodwill exactly on all others around it people lost it not just because of music but because of the person this is I think is very important lesson there as well. Right? So if you if you want to lead people well, You should maybe start with yourself turn yourself into a better person, right?	1.0
1	If you want to exercise a good influence on others around something that we see much in politics now intake quite the reverse but Guido, I'm sure old Allison's would want to get in touch with you if they had a people reach you what's the best are you on Twitter or Vine?	1.0
2	No, no. No. I mean I mentioned that freak but I don't even have Netflix right so I watch Netflix last year when I was on sabbatical in the u.s. At home. We don't have to be we don't have Twitter.

2	That's do. I hope we can meet in person.	1.0
1	Absolutely. Absolutely you have come to London. Just please let us know.	1.0
2	Well, yeah, actually I come to London at the end of November brilliant. We'll be in touch.	1.0
1	Thanks very much indeed. Line up by now that was fascinating absolutely loved it. So interesting really really interesting just before we came on air you were mentioning the House of Commons. Yeah, the I think we must be watching this. I forget the Channel's name because it was either the BBC News Channel or BBC Parliament and possibly both because we ended up switching off at about 10 o'clock in the evening and we started watching roughly lunchtime and I I tuned in to catch boris's statement returning from New York after the Supreme Court ruling and actually it was almost one of those entertaining afternoons of my things in my life. So for anyone asked to see me, you must watch if it's not the full show that at least the highlights of Jeffrey cocks the Attorney General because it was absolutely a PST A Pas du tout pas de resistance. Unbelievably full-blown that the whole works in the guys going to this is amazing roaring baritone anyway, but he just he just blew blew the opposition away. I think there were there were heavy expectations coming into yesterday because we're recording this on Thursday the 26th 26th of September. So it's a few days just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the Pierogi of Parliament and there's an expectation coming. Into the commons that know that they were going to Duff up the attorney general and follow up by duffing up Boris and my god did those expectations get reversed very very quickly. So first the Jeffrey Cox in this is fantastic and hilarious and then you have you know, the man himself. So Boris came in and basically just gave no quarter and there's a very appreciate what Dido just said about social media. He's absolutely right, but if you do have the To engage with say Twitter. There is a very special pleasure that can come with engaging with Twitter while simultaneously watching a big event and the Parliamentary session was a big event. So it's almost that's that's what it's designed. Almost all yeah always had become as a mixture of Theater Grand guignol black comedy. I don't know how to describe it. I'll be I'll be looking at grand grand. What does that thing? I couldn't tell you I decided to extend impressive but the Macabre so I've always interpreted, but I don't You know the full definition Barack possibly. I'm just starting at mindless French words now either. What's I don't know what's happening and being taken over by Spirit of Madness. But Boris launches at there was no Contrition. No apology was General Gregory an to the power of infinity and during during the proceedings. Basically, he's worked out perfectly how to be the world's most successful troll on the back of perhaps the success of gone. From so he started using the phrase surrender Bill about the Hilary Benn act which is basically means to be can't can't leave without a deal and every time he used the term surrender Bill the opposition benches would just get would just get more and more Angry. So course you would then continue to use the phrase surrender bills that why you change your Twitter hand. So I've changed my Twitter handle to surrender a bill cousin of surrender bill, but last night I was just having the funniest. Time of it and then I thought okay. Let's really go for it. And I said could everybody please stop using the word surrender Bill hashtag surrender Bill and then I think followed up with the first rule of surrender bill is due not mentions do not talk about surrender Bill. The second rule of surrender will is do not talk about surrender Bill and those have been my most popular tweets ever. So everyone has been filed in and it was extraordinarily funny how that must is so much fun. But on honest on a slightly more sobering note D. The one thing that Also kind of a last night was I think was Barry Sherman and some woman who is named. I don't even want to remember from the Labour party the amount of hostility rage blind rage real hateful rage that came back up Boris is it was a sight to believe and for what? It's worth. I'm and I'm clearly on one side of debate among arm the pro breaks it side but it struck me that I think labor and the lib Dems have called the public mood a hundred percent wrong on this so when they're saying own, Where the language is in temperate and in moderate and all the rest of it? I think they're no because what Boris was doing yesterday was he was giving a like a sort of a Channel of venting for those of us those Seventeen point four million people who basically felt completely cheesed off the last three and a bit years and he's actually no lightning rod for the for the opposition but an opportunity for those those sitting there not a trivial number of people who frankly have felt cheated and betrayed and he's now he's now just Taken the taken the fight to Parliament in those small way. I know anything can happen. But what do you what do you think the next steps are II couldn't even begin to say because I mean, I'm no expert in Parliament procedure and there's been but apparently neither. Does anybody else this writing the laws now as they go on I saw a headline saying that Boris had lied to the queen or something is that these terms are very nuanced. So I'm again stress. I'm no expert but my take on it is that at Boris had perfectly Sound Advice perfectly credible advice from his legal people including the Attorney General to do what he did your ocean to the mechanics as that basically said dismissing Parliament to then reinstating it the later date and that was all deemed to be sufficiently legal for him to go ahead and meet the queen and then the Supreme Court Bear in mind that also a number of very high-profile local British Justice. People also approved it and then the Supreme Court 11 to nothing decided that it was it was technically unlawful. But I think is Boris himself said what's really happened is that the legal system has been brought in it to a pine on these it has no matter talking about it has nothing to do with politics. This is the last thing you really want to happen in terms of the UK the British constitution. It is not for the courts to decide what parliamentary procedure ought to be. Like it's none of their business and you know, because we've got hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent to draw upon and people are now that that is exactly what gido is talking about in relation to the elites. Now when the elites had cornered they will do absolutely anything to you know to ensure that they win. Well, I think in this case this is this is a classic example of a Battle Royal where neither side is backing down, but the difference is know that there was a simple majority the leave And that simple majority a total of 17 and a half million people have been ignored for us three years. So no surprise that they're angry that I'm angry. And so there's a phrase that John Lanchester used it in one of his pieces a while back guy who writes for London of your books that somebody going to quote ridiculous Basil's 40-ish lengths unquote to achieve something and that's what the remain cap of done. So they're driving a coach and horses through historical precedent through law. You're through normal parliamentary life through everything just to overturn a perfectly legitimate vote. It's quite sickening. Really. Are you have some I know some people who are remain has and I get I detect that they are starting to get weary with it as well. You know Whitney nothing. Yeah, if we're not careful something get killed. Well, I say that in all sincerity. I don't mean it to have her that wanted to happen. But if trust me when you see the footage of certain labor and peas just that does blind with Fury just lashing out at Boris is deeply unsettling. Well, we can still get there.
