2	I also have everyone go vote can't do it at the same time. I'm sorry. It just it's terrible right now because we only got one mic on our side and if you don't know why I don't have a mic is because we only have two mics and the other mic is given to none other than our lovely cousin Brandon 20 Poe.	-1.0
1	Hello. Everyone. Hello.	0.0
2	How's everybody doing? Just so you know? Alright, so today we want to talk a little bit about Fitness and you know trying to get into getting to healthy habits, but first we just want to introduce you and we just want to have you explain a little bit of you know, how you how you even know us.	1.0
1	First of all, I am the best I am the First cousin of Richard and Nico. My mom is the sister of their dad and we have been best friends ever since we were younger and that's how I know you guys you guys my cousins.	0.0
2	Yes, that's cool. When we were younger. We were super close and now that we're older we're super close. Yeah even Closer Closer now. Yeah, he's one of my brother's groomsmen by the way. Yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah.	1.0
2	Well, yeah, we have that introduction. Now. Let's get let's get even deeper. What do you do Brandon? Yeah. What do you do?	1.0
1	Oh, well, I help people become better versions of themselves. And so my occupation is a personal trainer personal trainer for California Family Fitness in Sacramento, but I don't really just look at myself as a trainer. I look at myself as a life coach kind of someone who has more of a therapeutic side. It not just physical. It's not just exercise but it's more about your daily decisions more about your habits. It's more about just trying to become a better version than what you were yesterday just baby steps. So just me being on the sidelines trying to help people coach them Mentor them to be better than they were is an absolute blessing and tell us.	1.0
2	How did you get there? Oh man, where do you start off?	0.0
1	So before I became a trainer, I was working at Cold Stone Creamery for Five years and that was you know, I had a great job there taught me a lot of character. I was cleaning every night taught me to bring the energy but how personal training came about was. I was training my mom and my dad one Saturday morning at Cal Fit and I was stretching them in the manager walked by and he approached me and said that I wasn't allowed to like instruct or tell them what to do because it would be a liability but He offered me an opportunity and he said if you take the certification through our club you could be a trainer for us and pass the certification and the rest was history. It's been four years since I've been trying to now it's crazy.	1.0
2	Have you always been into fitness?	0.0
1	Like even before I think Fitness was instilled in me ever since I was in karate at age nine. I was doing karate four to six times a week, you know one to two hours a day sometimes three, especially on the weekends and you know, I would compete and I think that competitive Wedge was instilled in me ever since I was a kid and you did pretty well. Yeah, if I mean I was very competitive with serious, you know, and I give thanks to my Sensations the John out there. He was like my second dad and you know, he was definitely one of the reasons why I'm such a great trainer today because he the way that I count the way that I talk the way that I push other people he did to me. So kind of he left his print in my life.	1.0
2	Yeah, it's pretty deep so you definitely take some of that. From what you learned in karate to like when you train you're absolutely right science. Is that how it works right now?	1.0
1	We're yeah. Yeah, it does it's, you know, the technique and stuff it's different but the it's more of the mental thing. Yeah. He's the one who caught me taught me discipline sacrifice because since he Etc, you know, just got to work. That's it, man.	1.0
2	And what's your favorite thing about being a life coach a personal life?	0.0
1	Everything is knowing that you know in any small way or any big way. I could have a positive influence on someone's life. You know, I feel like a lot of us haven't sometimes our judgment is cloudy. Sometimes we don't know why things are the way they are and so I just try to help increase my clients awareness and understanding the true problem and then going to the root and seeing how we can transform them internally and then eventually as we do that the external transformational just follow, you know, so it's more just about what are you doing day? Like, why do you why do people want to lose 10 pounds? Why do what people want to lose 30 pounds? But really it's Yes, it's a health decision. But it's also an emotional decision. Yeah, like good exactly. Right. It's a you know, what sometimes the opinions of others have like a huge role but I think the most important thing is your own opinion, you know, everybody's different. So what makes you happy is it losing 20 pounds? Is it getting a little bit stronger? Is it, you know increasing your self defense is it just being more functional, you know, everything's different majority of your clients.	1.0
2	What what type of people are they? Like are they the type to	0.0
1	Want to lose 10 pounds or more for most people it's toning losing body fat. Just being yeah, I would say that like more body composition wanting to and you know, 80% of all clientele are females. And so if you think about after pregnancy, if you think about how females invest in their lashes their nails their plastic surgery everything their hair, you know, they invest in their bodies and so but with males is a little different because you know, we go through Sports we have friends that we hang out with that we all gym and like Sigmund Freud said it like most males the reason why we exercise So it's sex-related. So he says like the reason why people want to drive fast cars are the reason why they want to buy nice shoes of the reason why they want to dress a certain way is because they want to attract other people. It's like something called pheromones. So yeah, it's very very interesting. So he says a lot of the decisions that we actually make the color that we want the body that we want or the kind of house or car or job. You know, there is kind of like sex-based kind of Interest Is pretty interesting, you know, but anyway back to Just Fitness and itself being a trainer for the past four years has saved my life it gave me a sense of purpose and I've dealt with a lot of drug addiction to the past and also dealt with you know, just finding my own security and life but personal training kind of just fell into my lap and it allowed me to do something greater than myself. So it was nice and Growing up are going to college you didn't study to be a nosy right now. I wanted to do a first, you know, I wanted to be a doctor but I didn't want to be a doctor. It was something that my parents wanted me to do. Yeah, you know and then as I started realizing what I really wanted to do, I just kind of went with my own instincts. There's that Jim Carrey thing that he said where ya know you can either live your life doing something that you kind of like doing and fail at that. Or you can live your life and do something that you love right and fail at that like at least go out with doing something that you love because you know, he talked about his dad and his dad just you know wasn't really living happy lives. Thanks for trying to find, you know purpose like what really drives you what gives you fulfillment in life. It's really just about service. It's about what you're doing for other people. That's what gives you like the most Joy before you're doing Fitness.	1.0
2	You are actually working like at a clinic.	0.0
1	like some kind of like medical yeah yeah yeah I was getting volunteer hours I was working at a hospital I did also did an Outpatient Center and but were you fine like did you find like enjoyment like no matter how it every time I was I was looking at the clock you know and once I came to the point where I was not present in my work I just told myself why would I like why would I trade that well when I trade my time for money and at least I should be doing something that actually lose myself in like loot like enjoy your work you know they say the three habits of Happiness the first one is journaling take it like you know really increase your awareness of everything that's happening like I'm having my first podcast my two cousins I have the pretty ladies over here you know we're all 26 When We Were Young you're healthy our family's okay like journaling support because it helps increase your gratitude right the second habit of happiness is savoring so when you have a cup of coffee or cup of tea don't just drink	1.0
2	It you sipping on it savor it taste it favorite, you know a good one.	1.0
1	Enjoy it Savor Life Saver the conversation Savor the Time Saver the meal Savor the workout Savor the day right? Because you never know when your last one is and the third one. The third habit of happiness is Find meaning in your work find purpose in your work. So journaling savoring and Find meaning your work and it's just yeah, that's what that's what training gave me.	1.0
2	Did you get a lot of Backlash from parents or out.	-1.0
1	Absolutely. I got into it my dad a little bit, you know going against his beliefs. He you know wants me to be financially secure and his own belief is I have to be in the medical field where I have to do something that related to succeed but then I think really the bigger picture for him was just me want him wanting me to get out my comfort zone and not settle for mediocrity, but my paycheck does not define that. You know and once I kind of stay true to myself, I'm much more like my mom. We're both very emotional people and she followed her passion. She loves what he does. She does. She definitely has moments of high stress, but at the end of the day, you know, she's not waking up or having like anxiety to come into work on Monday. She went, you know went through that phase for 20 years of her life where she was working for a company Sunday night. You know, she have to wake up the next morning 5:30 6 o'clock wouldn't get home till seven stuck in traffic. Have to make dinner for the kids only get 30 minutes to an hour with her kids. And I remember being kid always wanting that time with her, you know, like where's mom like, you know, and it was tough but you know, sometimes tragedies our disguises blessings and seven years ago when she got late 7 or 10 years ago. I don't know when she got laid off from her job. She just decided to follow her heart and open her own catering business and now, you know by the by the blessings of God and the Lord she's Families doing well, you know and I know we're very humbled for all the opportunities but you know, I'm just really happy that she can lead right she followed she's doing what she loves. She's following her dreams and I'm also following mine but people who are listening shout out to Heavenly food creation and help grow, but make sure you go follow them on Facebook.	1.0
2	Her name is Winnie one. Tipo look her up. You got a wedding. You got a bar. Mitzvah. You got any kind of Celebration? She's the person to go to shout out to unto weenie. He shout you out right now. Anyways back to be Bunty phone though. All right, so, you know what? I'm really glad we were able to have this conversation with you because it's bringing awareness to a lot of people that work like a 9 to 5 job, you know, there's people out there that they go to a job and it's like they're just killing themselves salsa, you know trying to find themselves, you know, let me be honest with you if I always tell people when I get compliments of the gym.	1.0
1	You know, you're in great shape or I want to be like you right? I don't I truly don't believe that I would be in the shape. I am now if it wasn't for my environment, right like you are what your environment is if I hang out with a whole bunch of depressed people most likely I'm going to be depressed if I hang around with people that are usually up like really positive most likely I'll be positive if I'm hanging around people that all Count Their macros and go to the gym six times a week most likely I'll be fit right etcetera. So I am kind of humbled. I'm occupation, but the same time if I worked at nine to five or ten to six whatever it's either I got to wake up really early in the morning and be tired and work out or go to the gym after work where I'm tired and work out. So I understand like how hard it must be for people to have consistency. Like you have to make it a daily plan where you're going to go designate this time and just execute and stick with it. Right and accountabilities huge. You know, that's why I said It's important to have somebody that could keep you in check. Whether is your best friend your brother or your spouse or a trainer a coach whatever but honestly with those people I completely understand. I think the goal is really just to find a balance in your life. Like it's not everybody's goal to be in the next bikini competitions not everybody's goal to be the next powerlifter. It's not everybody's goal to run a mile in, you know, five minutes six minutes. I think just follow what makes you happy with his Jiu-Jitsu that you love if it's basketball. All that you love if it's yoga that you love just continue to do that and you know be mindful of your nutrition. I think for me what's really worked is intermittent fasting is give me it gives me a block where I could eat at a particular time also count my calories and I think that gives me flexibility with feeding Cravings think counting calories is a huge skill that a lot of people don't consistently do and I'm a big advocate of that because that really changed my life ever since we watched The Hodgetwins that's how I learned counting calories. Calories in versus calories out. These guys are eating chicken the chicken nuggets. They're eating pizza. They're having Taco Bell and they're still looking good and I was like, I was confused. What do we eat for dinner? Like I was under the conventional thought that you have to eat brown rice chicken and broccoli meal prep your food in order for you to be fit. But you don't yeah, you don't like you. All you have to do is track your calories do a little bit of cardio hit a little bit of resistance just baby steps like when my favorite quotes is by Bruce Lee and he says I do not fear the man. The kick is 10,000 times. I fear the man the kicks once a day for ten thousand days. So at the end of the day, it's not about short-term intensity. It's about consistency. Right just it's it's the accumulation of the little things that matter right? It's habits is where we're creatures of habit. So I think that's about anything in life. If you want to be successful in anything. It's really just about consistency. That's it.	1.0
2	So and how do you tell your clients that so I'm sure that you deal with clients? To even though you give them this whole Spiel they just don't fall into the tea they kind of slack off or they give you attitude. So with that kind of scenario.	1.0
1	What do you typically do but they might think that you should go through that. My thing is just showing patience, you know, Transformations don't happen overnight and I think for me, it's just trying to challenge them in their weak areas and just keep them accountable drink more water. Like a lot of people don't drink enough water dude for females out there track your water intake at least 90 fluid ounces of water or two-thirds of your body weight and for males you want at least a hundred twenty fluid ounces or two-thirds of your body weight. So a lot of people when they train and I asked how much water they have. They're hella tired in the beginning and I asked how much water in there like I haven't had any water. I just had my coffee right and then if you're if you're sleeping for six to eight hours, you're not having any water then we wake up you go pee you have coffee you have you haven't had water for 10 12 hours possibly and then you try to work out and do cardio and less weights your guests 70% of your muscle is water that you need water. So that's number one. One two, I'll try to help them. Tell them to get a little more rest if they can because that's a big thing. But you know, if they slip I think it from me. I've learned that it's better just to keep showing positive encouragement instead of trying to tear them down. You know, it's kind of like parenting and you don't want to tear people down.	1.0
2	So if someone's watching this right now and they're like they've never even stepped on a treadmill before and there. Life and you know, their eating habits are really bad. Like what is the first thing that you would have them do like First Time Fitness ever like they came into the gym. They said I want Brandon blind people. Where do I begin?	-1.0
1	You know, I think that Doing things at an extreme measure like trying to do everything all at once can be paralyzing. Let's say like it's decision paralysis when you tell somebody I want you to do an hour of cardio a day. I want you to count your calories. I want you have this much water. I want you to sleep this wedge apple cider vinegar. I want you to have 30 25 to 35 grams of fiber at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you throw too much shot them they kind of get like get stuck it in there. Yeah, so I try to give them a smart goals something that's specific something that's measurable. All something that's realistic attainable the timely and example of a smart goal is I want you to lose four pounds in four weeks. I want you to track your water intake. I want you to track your way and every single day and then at the end of each week take the average of your weight and the compared to the next and to the next so it's like once I hear yeah, you're not you're not looking day-to-day measurements. You're looking at weekly measurements and on average. So you get a general idea of where your weight is. Actually that's kind of like stocks, you know goes up it goes down. But where is the general Trend going, you know? A lot of fluctuations that people have our water weight fluctuations. You have salt you have sugar you have alcohol you have menstruation. You have stress. You have sleep. You have so many things fiber that affect your water weight at that particular point. So it's important to take your weigh-ins average them out compared to the next week. So you get a general idea. Am I really losing weight and my maintaining what's the rate at my loser? Because you can lose the to 3 pounds a day go in the sauna cut your car. Yeah, you know eat clean and that's just a lot of water weight. Illusion, but if you're talking about fat loss fat loss takes time. Yeah about 1 pound per week. Gotcha.	-1.0
2	So dang really, it's your rights consistency throughout the like you want them to lose a pound every single week.	1.0
1	And then from there it's baby steps, you know, and it could I possibly be more but you want to give people there's something magical happens when you have psychological wins, right like waking up early and following through or doing the cardio for 20 minutes. Like you said you were going to do a reading for 10 minutes if you said or saving $500 a month extra hundred even anything just set a goal something that's attainable something they can do and just keep building off of that and over time next, you know, you're successful, right but you just have to stay like Gary Vee says micro speed macro patients micro speed macro pain, you got to move quickly. You got to execute you got to have a plan of attack strategy, right? And then you got to be patient with the process and that's deep. Do you know where did this love you Fitness?	1.0
2	So cousin quality time. I guess I was it you guys in the next video. Thank you for listening the next one. What kind of what kind of workouts?	1.0
1	You think I should start off with I think you know having a combination of three things of doing some type of cardio some type of dynamic stretching and static stretching combination of both and also doing a combination of compound lifting and functional things is important. So an example for you, you know would be someone more from 5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill elliptical or StairMaster do a little bit of Mobility routine loosen up your hips because you down a lot loosen up your back foam roller. Been about 15 20 minutes on that. So look about 30 minutes of warming up where your body is, like actually sweating before you do workout and the great dead great compound exercise or deadlifts just important that you keep your spine neutral and I would definitely if there's one workout that I would like you to start doing it would be dead lifts, like straightening your back straight to New York or your glutes. It's a full body workout. So you're not a lot of birds with one stone with that one movement. I just got to make sure you do it correctly and then like a lot of stability core exercises and the cardio, you know, it's not again. It's you know, it's not about intensity is just about consistency, you know, you know that you know how to track your calories. You're pretty good at that quick question.	1.0
2	So does it matter like what routine you do throughout the week? Like because you know, like if you go on YouTube or like you look at someone else's like routine throughout the week, it could be like chest and back day or left chest and arm day and leg day does it does that really matter?	0.0
1	They're all very there's a lot of variations of different programs out there different splits, you know, but the most important thing again is just consistency because I don't focus on the Minor Details. I mean if you are only able to go to the gym three times a week, I would probably do a leg Push Pull or three full body workouts or depending on whatever your goals are. You just have to prioritize that workout program towards whatever your goal is. Gotcha.	1.0
2	Okay, because for me I know like I always get stuck on like trying to figure out Out like oh man, I gotta do my back day now and then tomorrow I got to focus on chest day but like toms you can do both, you know just to save a little bit time.	1.0
1	Like if it really I think the biggest part that people don't hit enough of consistently is just through the nutrition because if like there are the I've had clients that aren't extremely active. I have a 59 year old client. She was 278 pounds when we first met and she's lost 57 pounds. She's now in like 2:17 to some and for her to do it and she has any issues and she's five two five three this Asian lady. The biggest thing that we just focus on was her nutrition and she countered a calorie she weighed her food out. She kept her diet simple and she was losing weight. You know, we I was she trained with me two times a week and then I had her come and once on the weekend by herself and literally I would just prescribe her 20 minutes of cardio 10 minutes before ten minutes after a little bit of free weights here and there a little bit of machines and over time. It was really the nutrition that guided her to get to where she wanted to be, you know, so I think for a lot of people the nutritional part is hard, you know food is our Escape is definitely my Escape black. I love food, you know, but, you know a little bit of sacrifice like during the week and then you get enjoy yourself on the weekend. I think he's really again all about balance if you have 30 days if you're good, 25 out of those 30 days most likely you'll have results right always tell people Good day of bad eating or one bad day of eating will not hurt you in one good day. Beauty will not help you. It's really just about what are you doing for? The most part right? Don't focus on the little things. What are you doing on the bigger picture? Yeah like that.	1.0
2	I think I think we're good. Let's do a speed round. Let's do a speed run of quick questions quick answers. What's wrong with that? Well, I didn't even say anything. I saw you were like, all right. First you go for a second so I can get an idea what you want. Okay. Okay. All right percentage ratio between workout and diet go. Like what's more like? Yeah that like if you have to put that in percentages.	1.0
1	I would do 6040 60/40 I think 60% diet 40% workout. I think you know you do have to work hard to to get like you can't just you know, it's a good combination of both. I just say I would put 60/40 because I feel like a lot of people when it's January 1st. The very first question that they asked for that the devil's tell themselves is I got to go to the gym. They're not they're not thinking I gotta save calories or I gotta watch my eat my food just like I gotta go too. Like a lot of times when people are broke their like I got to find more ways to make money right now. You have to find ways to decrease your expenses. I focus on what you can control first, right? And so it's just really about detaching yourself keeping track. You know, I think having the ability what one of my mentors told me what doesn't get measured does not get improved. You have to have some type of Quantified measurement so that way okay. It's a Earth to see this time, how can I get a B next time How can I get a right? So for people track a calories while your food out for not waiting some of your food out in your kind of just estimating that can only take you so far but honestly once you get in the habit of doing so keep things simple prep your meals I just have a whole bunch of foods, you know ready in the fridge. That way you don't have to eat things that you know overload on things that are healthy for you now and you can still have a good time like you don't have to, you know, go be all in. Have to be too extreme like find a balance, you know, enjoy your life suposed to be a speed round.	1.0

1	Yeah, everything people can find me at beep when Tipo on Instagram. Yeah. I just want to give a special shout-out to my baby. Cindy cakes. Love you, baby. You know saying that's my that's my baby, you know. She honestly I was supposed to go to with a wedding. I was supposed to go to a wedding with her today and she knew that this weekend was important for me to spend time with my family and my friends with my boys and honestly for her to give me this moment, it's a type of love that is liberating not controlling, you know, and I've had my fair share of controlling relationships in the past and for me to be at this point, she had this been with you guys. It's really cuz I her so, thanks, baby. I love you. Thank you. Mom my dad for being together for 37 years. It was just their anniversary couple days ago. So ever so, you know, one of the reasons why I am the way I am is because my parents have been able to have that consistency in their marriage and be great role models for their kids. And then thank you to California Family Fitness and all the clients and all the family that in relationships that I've gotten over there. And thank you too. Just everything and everybody aim.	1.0
2	Men, yeah, thanks to the rooster crows cover. That was so with the boosters Rose.	1.0
1	You don't share a lot of experiences and you know. Just enjoy we both both my cousin's we literally can just be in bed. Chill together eat good food. Have a good workout and just do the simple things in life. And it really doesn't matter what we do when I'm with them. It's just as long as we're together and I think that's the beauty of it is. It's very low maintenance, you know, just as long as we have each other we find gratitude in that and it's always a good time, you know, but with you know, Richard Nico both of them, you know, they Have they're like my best friend's, you know, they've been my best friends ever since I was younger and you know, keep it real with you guys, you know, as you get older things change feelings change people change. There's a lot of movement in life. And sometimes you forget about the people that helped you get to where you are and I think for me by my you know, the blessing my mom. She had told me a couple weeks ago that because it's miss me and and I wanted Create consistency and effort and shows them that I miss them too. And I know it's been hard and I know it's hasn't been things. Haven't been the same. So it's kind of like having that body bit about bodybuilding mentality, like whatever your weak points are in a relationship like focus on those like all the people in Sacramento. Like I see them consistently. I see my baby girl Cindy all the time. I see Kev, you know weekly, you know, it's about maybe investing time in to the people that you don't see a whole lot like I don't see my sister's a whole lot. My nephew's a whole lot my cousins a whole lot. So I think this year I definitely want to have a better goal of strengthening the relationship those types of relationships.	1.0
